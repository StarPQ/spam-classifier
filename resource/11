2	Subject: can you help ! ! ! from : mrs . victoria ndlovu attn : you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don ' t know me personally , but for the introduction , i am mrs . victoria ndlovu , the wife of late dr . onomua andrew ndlovu who was recently murdered in the land dispute inzimbabwe . i got your contact from the international trade centre here in johhanesburg and decided to write you . my husband was among the few black zimbabwe rich famers murdered in the cold blood by the agents of the ruling governmentof president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party , controlled by the white minority . before his death , he had taken me to to deposite the sum offive million dollars us $ 5 m . with a security and finance company as if he knew the looming danger in zimbabwe . the money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was earmarked for the purchase of new farm machinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm in lesotho and swaziland . this land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act , which wholly affected the rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned the modusoperand " adopted by the government . this resulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war veterans and some political thugs presently , more than six - hundred [ 600 ] people have so far been killed . heads of government from the west , especially the great britain and the united states of america have voice their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan . the south africa development community ( sadec ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land reform act . it is against this background that i and my children who are currently staying as refugee in a south african republic but currently seeking an assylum in any of the the west african countries have decided to transfer my late husband ' s money into a foreign account . as the only and legitimate - wife of my late husband i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transfer without theknowledge of my country ' s government who are tatically freezing our familieswealthback home in zimbabwe and the south africa government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the delimma of investing this amount of money in the south africa republic for the fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . moreso , the south africa financial foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence i am seeking for assistance . as a business person whom i must entrust my future and that of my family on his hands , i must let you know that this transfer is 100 % risk free . therefore if you accept to assist my family , we are willing to offer you 20 % of the total sum for your assitance , 70 % for me and my family , while 10 % will be mapped out for all expenses . i would wish to invest in your country on real - estate based on your advice and i would also receive assurance that you would ' nt sit on this money when transfered into your personal or company account . if this plea is acceptable by you please do send me your personaldetails , name and address , telephone and fax numbers . you should know that this business is highly confidential and shall be kept within you alone . i hope to hear from you soon on the above email address . thanks , best regards , mrs victoria ndlovu . reply to : hod _ 808 @ yahoo . com get tiscali broadband from £ 15 : 99

2	Subject: electric developments i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your question , as well as the questions raised in drew ' s e - mail . here ' s what we found out . . . steve ' s question : what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california ? what you ' re really asking here is " what are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline ? " in this analysis , there are a few considerations - - ( 1 ) original capital cost to construct facilities , ( 2 ) the operating cost of the facilities , including energy loss , and ( 3 ) environmental and other permitting considerations . engineers tell us that , as a rule of thumb , high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately $ 800 , 000 to $ 1 mm / mile to construct turnkey . this figure is comparable to the $ 1 mm / mile " rule of thumb " we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter ( 30 - 36 " ) high - pressure steel pipeline . in terms of operating costs , for anything over 100 miles in length , there are three ( 3 ) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission : ( 1 ) transformation loss , ( 2 ) radiation loss ( efm ) and ( 3 ) heat loss across the conductors . a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3 % . this number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on transwestern ' s pipeline . the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting . there just aren ' t many new transmission lines being approved . it was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example , could take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization . the issues of electromagnetic field ( emf ) radiation around high voltage power lines , along with other wildlife endangerment concerns , are significant obstacles in securing permits for right - of - way . in short , the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines , the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure . drew ' s questions : 1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant ? for purposes of this exercise , i ' m assuming we ' re talking gas - fired generation . developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant : 1 . market area demand ( distributive ) and / or transmission access to market 2 . water rights for turbine cooling 3 . ease of permitting ( environmental , encroachment , fed / state / local regulations , affected agencies / jurisdiction ) 4 . proximity to natural gas pipeline / supply infrastructure 2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much the same all over ? ferc order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities and / or power pools in the various operating regions . ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmission / reliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions . the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under ferc order 436 / 500 / 636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines . it ' s pretty obvious from the california example this past summer , that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states , particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of independent system operators ( iso ' s ) , there is substantial room for improvement ( and possible further ferc involvement ) . " in the open access final rule ( order no . 888 ) , the commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service . all public utilities that own , control , or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff . they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases . order no . 888 also provides for the full recovery of stranded costs - - that is , costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier . " 3 . how do ipp ' s decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc . separately ) ? in my experience , there is no " one size fits all " formula or strategy . for example , in the past we ' ve seen calpine take a very hands - on approach to supplying its ipp projects . in the mid to late ' 80 ' s , during the build out of several qf ' s ( cogens ) , calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project . in today ' s market , calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from statoil and set - up a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western u . s . power projects . in other projects , developer / owners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply / transportation to the project . in short , projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply / transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfp ' s for gas supply / transportation , or whether to take a more hands - on approach ala calpine . 4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ? last december , the ferc issued order no . 2000 , a final rule on regional transmission organizations ( rto ' s ) . order 2000 builds on the foundation of orders 888 and 889 ( issued in 1996 ) . according to ferc chairman jim hoecker , order 2000 makes " a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants . " therefore , order 2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in orders 888 and 889 , continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate , not state or regional boundaries , as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privately - owned transmission companies . ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation . the order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation . the order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned " public utilities " that are subject to ferc jurisdiction , and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning state / municipal , cooperative and federally owned systems . ferc believes that , regardless of format , rto ' s will offer the following benefits : ( 1 ) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry , ( 2 ) improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management , ( 3 ) improve grid reliability , ( 4 ) remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices , ( 5 ) improve market performance , ( 6 ) increase coordination among state regulatory agencies , ( 7 ) cut transaction costs , ( 8 ) facilitate the success of state retail access programs , and ( 9 ) facilitate lighter - handed regulation . critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility , voluntary rto formation and transmission rate reforms ( i . e . , incentives ) , order 2000 defers for case - specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational rto . moreover , order 2000 does not compel any transmission owner to join an rto , but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants , as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the hold - outs . as to the final part of the question ( " why should we care ? " ) , presumably , the development of a fully - functioning rto network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders . as ferc reads it , the future of gas - fired generation for both merchant and utility systems , depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system . therefore , the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure . unfortunately , sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals . 5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ? natural gas prices of $ 5 / mmbtu can only " kill " gas - fired power plants in those instances where ( 1 ) there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel , ( 2 ) demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or ( 3 ) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel . in the western u . s . marketplace , particularly in california , i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation . renewable resources currently meet less than 5 % of the total electric resource requirements . $ 32 / barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas ( even at a $ 5 / mmbtu price ) . moreover , california environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible . while demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs , historically , they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power . as to the final point , i ' m unable to comment on the risk of future legal / regulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel . steven harris 10 / 26 / 2000 10 : 05 am to : kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron cc : jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron @ enron subject : re : electric developments since you are the " expert " in this area , i need to know what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california . if you could let me know by next friday i would appreciate it . kevin hyatt 10 / 25 / 2000 04 : 32 pm to : sharrisl @ enron . com cc : subject : electric developments steve , see below . drew asked me to help him out with his meeting . kh - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by kevin hyatt / et & s / enron on 10 / 25 / 2000 04 : 34 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - enron energy services from : drew fossum 10 / 25 / 2000 01 : 49 pm to : dari dornan / et & s / enron @ enron , lee huber / et & s / enron @ enron , tony pryor / et & s / enron @ enron , maria pavlou / et & s / enron @ enron , susan scott / et & s / enron @ enron , jim talcott / et & s / enron @ enron , kathy ringblom / et & s / enron @ enron cc : michael moran / et & s / enron @ enron , kim wilkie / et & s / enron @ enron , kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron , john dushinske / et & s / enron @ enron , shelley corman / et & s / enron @ enron subject : electric developments when we originally decided to use my staff meetings for " graduate education " one of the hot topics was the electric industry . we all had a first lesson on this topic in shelley ' s electricity seminar last summer . now , john and kevin have graciously agreed to join us tuesday at 1 : 30 to discuss recent developments in electric markets and nn ' s and tw ' s efforts to attract power generation load to the system . specific topics i hope to cover include the following : 1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant ? 2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much the same all over ? 3 . how do ipps decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc . separately ) ? 4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ? 5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ? depending on how deeply we get into these topics , we may need to schedule a follow - up session at a later date . i look forward to seeing you on tuesday . df

2	Subject: i will be out next week imbalances : i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand . again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ? i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions : how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ? can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to keith once we get the ar issue solved ? where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ? where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ? duke energy 206 is still a problem . do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large number to me , can we net some of them ? are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex contract ? is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have the right to use . can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ? can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me . gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some where we are owed ? is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ? where did the exxon imbalance come from ? do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ? can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ? what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon , how old is this imbalnce ? mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ? i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can we resolve this ? i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to have to work on a better way to check our positions . i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .

2	Subject: california 2 / 13 for questions contact robert johnston at x 39934 . court case denies rate hikes as forecast in our report yesterday , the federal court in los angeles refused to allow the two california utilities to raise rates to recoup undercollections of their power costs since last august . we had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities , but push the rate hike question to an appeals court . instead , judge ronald lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until march 5 th . the utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of short - term rate hikes . edison reaches the end of its grace period for a $ 200 million payment today and a $ 600 million payment on thursday . absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes , the governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position . bankruptcy grows more likely regardless of the legal technicalities , the bottom line is the same . as we have cautioned since last wednesday , there is a serious risk that a creditor or group of creditors could push for bankruptcy , perhapsas soon as tomorrow when the period of forbearance agreed to by financial creditors runs out . before this ruling , there was reasonable assurance that the utilities would be restored to health by their court victory . now there is real fear a coherent deal is unravelling , and that it will not take much for a small group of financial creditors to break ranks . and the prospects for supplier creditors now look much bleaker and more dangerous . and there is an increased temptation for the utilities to declare bankruptcy and take their chances with a judge rather than the california assembly . the politicians will try to find a way to prevent bankruptcy , but it will now be difficult . disarray in the legislature for now , the only card still being played is the " i give you a dollar , you give me a hot dog " plan , as state senator burton accurately summed it up . the state pumps money into the utilities in return for some kind of asset - - warrants , transmission lines , whatever , anything that can be brandished in front of the voters as proof that the utilities suffered and paid . but " there is little or no energy among legislators for either of the proposed solutions , " one senior figure in sacramento told our source yesterday afternoon . " legislators are running scared . and i don ' t know of a single legislator in either house , on either side , who has the slightest sympathy for the utiltiies now . they think the utiltiies have either been incompetent or shrewd or both . " the ruling will in all likelihood send officials back to the drawing board . " davis will propose a kind of shadow plan by friday , but there will be no real substance in it . what are we supposed to do in just four days ? there will not be a real substantive plan for three weeks , i think , at the earliest . " that period of uncertainty and lack of energy in the legislature could panic the creditors now . bankruptcy court if davis fails to cobble together a last - minute deal for rate hikes and some kind of purchase of transmission assets , then all parties will have to do a workout in federal bankruptcy court . the most likely scenario ( which we flagged last week ) is that the small ipps file an involuntary bankruptcy against edison , followed possibly by pg & e . involuntary bankruptcy would shield the utilities from creditor lawsuits and temporarily relieve them from debt payments . there is also speculation in the press this morning that some creditors are talking about a ch . 7 or liquidation proceeding , but that cannot yet be confirmed by sources .

troubles in california ' s politically crazed power market , an ill - advised foray into telecoms bandwidth trading and concerns about management badly dented enron ' s share price earlier this year , prompting the departure of jeffrey skilling , the firm ' s newish chief executive , in august . kenneth lay , an avid free - marketeer , friend of george bush and visionary chairman of the firm , was obliged to resume hands - on control . this has not slowed enron ' s decline . day by day , it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial quagmire that is largely of its own creation . not least thanks to its lack of transparency , the firm ' s credibility with the markets has eroded to the point that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread . enron ' s reputation for financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its third - quarter results came out in mid - october , showing a $ 1 billion write - off on water distribution , broadband trading and other investments . worse , disclosed only in passing by mr lay in a conference call with analysts , the firm suffered a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in capital , stemming from a hedging deal with a related private - equity fund called ljm . the charge was due to enron ' s forced sale of 55 m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer . almost nobody outside enron had been aware of the terms of the deal with ljm , a " structured finance vehicle " . enron ' s failure to offer details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear the worst about its huge balance sheet . its shares plunged by 19 % on october 30 th alone ( see chart on next page ) , before recovering a bit the next day . andrew fastow , who was replaced as chief financial officer on october 24 th , was a general partner in ljm . jeffrey mcmahon , his successor , has much to do to restore confidence . questions abound . were the trusts run at arm ' s length ? what did mr fastow earn from the partnership ? ominously , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) has now launched a formal inquiry . moody ' s , a rating agency , last week cut its rating on the company ' s debt to barely above " junk " level . further downgrades might unleash claims from other off - balance - sheet partnerships . those known about , such as atlantic water and marlin water , do not seem big enough to bankrupt enron , but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles . a lower credit rating could destroy enron ' s core franchise as the leading energy middleman , by scaring away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets . that might have nasty consequences in other markets . enron acknowledges that it is a large participant in the derivatives market , holding a portfolio with a notional value of $ 21 billion . rightly or wrongly , many traders believe that figure vastly understates enron ' s presence . if the firms on the other side of enron ' s trades start to fear that payment is not coming , they might curb their other trading , producing a knock - on effect . where this could end up is a subject of much conjecture . utilities that trade energy could be hit . so could the commodity and derivative operations of large commercial and investment banks . the ties are notably tight between enron and j . p . morgan chase , according to ventana capital , a research firm . not only does j . p . morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for enron ; it also has the largest derivative operation of any bank , as well as a large business trading commodities . there is " no doubt " that enron is on the other side of many j . p . morgan trades , says ventana . were enron to fail , ventana thinks " it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis " , worse , in some ways , than what occurred after ltcm . that merely froze the debt markets temporarily , whereas enron deals in the building - blocks of the american economy . imagine gridlock in the markets for gas , timber , coal , metals , fertiliser , bandwidth or indeed any of the products enron deals in . as yet , this all seems unlikely . many big traders were happy to deal with enron this week , although at shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past . trading on enrononline was reportedly strong . jim donnell of duke energy , a big energy trader , described " a huge dichotomy " between the collapse in confidence in enron in the equity and credit markets and the " business as usual " attitude taken by big commodity trading firms when considering enron as a counterparty . yet as questions about enron ' s credit - standing spread this week , it began to have difficulty making markets in some instruments . few firms would accept enron ' s name as guarantor of a credit derivative . in its core energy markets some big trading counterparties refused the enron name . on the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , two houses reportedly specified that they would not take enron ' s credit . the biggest credit exposure appeared to be with banks , whose $ 3 billion of back - up lines to enron were drawn down last week . j . p . morgan arranged an additional $ 1 billion emergency credit - line this week . this back - up , it is widely assumed , is needed mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade . too big to fail ? is enron too big and too important to be allowed to fail ? philip verleger , an energy economist , thinks that enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced . enron ' s rivals mostly disagree , unsurprisingly . but even enron ' s worst enemies do not ( yet ) expect the firm to die from its current crisis . most traders seem keen that it should live . " nobody likes to see a wholesale trader disappear , " says one . they admire enron ' s armies of traders and their ability to do deals . enrononline is one of the internet ' s few success stories , assuming its huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits , as the firm claims . enron ' s , and the financial system ' s , problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to meet its obligations . on the surface it is rich in assets , if not cash . but its lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt . in june 2000 , the economist challenged mr lay to reply to accusations of arrogance , high - handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law . his response was revealing . to show that such charges were baseless , he pointed to another firm unfairly maligned by critics : drexel burnham lambert , an investment bank that rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk - bond boom of the 1980 s . drexel was accused of arrogance , he groused , but it was only being " very innovative and very aggressive " . drexel was not bailed out : michael milken , its star , ended up in jail , and drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and ignominy . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron gets $ 1 billion new credit line , but must pledge top gas - pipeline assets by rebecca smith staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 02 / 2001 the wall street journal a 4 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines , but had to pledge its best gas - pipeline assets as collateral . the deal did little to appease an important credit - rating agency . standard & poor ' s ratings group lowered its rating on enron ' s long - term debt by one notch to triple - b from triple - b - plus and short - term debt to single - a - 3 from single - a - 2 , citing a belief that enron ' s planned sale of assets " will be insufficient to restore its long - term credit quality " to historic levels . moody ' s investors service inc . had issued debt downgrades earlier this week . s & p also lowered ratings on the debt of enron ' s pipeline systems , transwestern pipeline co . and northern natural gas co . , that were used to collateralize a $ 1 billion bank borrowing from j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . ' s salomon smith barney unit . enron said it would use the money from the 364 - day credit lines to refinance roughly $ 250 million in maturing obligations , leaving it $ 750 million to boost short - term liquidity . in dropping the pipeline credit ratings by two notches , s & p noted that the assets have become " more strategic to the company , " in part because they can be relied upon to consistently make money , unlike many other enron hard - asset investments . the pipelines produced $ 450 million in gas - transport revenue and an $ 85 million pretax profit in the third quarter on generally rising rates . that compared with revenue of $ 424 million for enron ' s foreign assets that scraped by with a $ 19 million earnings contribution . todd shipman , credit analyst for s & p , said there have been concerns that enron might take on too much debt , trying to prove it has enough cash on hand to meet its energy - trading obligations . but he said s & p wasn ' t worried by the most recent borrowing , because " we don ' t think it will be a permanent part of the balance sheet . " however , he added that the amount of additional debt it can take on top of the $ 13 billion it now has outstanding is " little to none . " with the sharp fall in its stock price , enron ' s market capitalization is now around $ 10 billion . an enron spokesman said " it should be a nonissue " because the company has no intention of borrowing more money anytime soon . in announcing the borrowing plan , enron ' s new chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said it was a move to " enhance investor confidence . " but stock - market investors reacted otherwise and enron stock gave up most of wednesday ' s gain , closing at $ 11 . 99 , down $ 1 . 91 , or 14 % , in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . with many enron bonds trading at two - thirds of their par value , bondholders didn ' t seem comforted either . enron has been in a defensive posture since it announced a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million two weeks ago , followed by news that it also took a $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down , based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers . the company replaced its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry into related - party transactions . enron on wednesday disclosed that the inquiry had been elevated to a formal probe . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ' s shares fall and debt rating is cut by richard a . oppel jr . 11 / 02 / 2001 the new york times page 11 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company dallas , nov . 1 - - with investors absorbing news of a formal securities and exchange commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit - rating agency , shares of the enron corporation fell 13 . 7 percent today , giving back most of the gains from wednesday ' s rally . late on wednesday , enron , the energy - trading giant based in houston , said the s . e . c . had intensified its inquiry into the company ' s finances , making it a formal investigation , carrying subpoena power . and today , standard & poor ' s lowered its rating on enron ' s senior debt by one notch , leaving it a few notches above junk bond status . the downgrading came after a similar cut by moody ' s investors service on monday . s . & p . left enron under review for a possible further downgrading . if enron ' s credit rating were dropped below investment grade , it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy - trading concerns to curtail their business with enron . s . & p . said that the company ' s ' ' financial flexibility has continued to diminish ' ' and that it had been unable ' ' to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron ' s core energy marketing business . ' ' but the rating agency also said it thought that ' ' enron ' s liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty ' ' and that , so far , ' ' most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with enron . ' ' this morning , enron said it had obtained $ 1 billion in additional financing . the line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis . but some industry officials said investors might have reacted negatively because enron had to pledge assets from two subsidiaries , northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline , to secure the credit line . an enron spokeswoman said that she did not know what interest rates the credit lines carried and that the company had no plans to seek even more financing deals . enron ' s shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the s . e . c . investigation and worries about off - balance - sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company ' s former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . enron shares fell $ 1 . 91 today , to $ 11 . 99 . some analysts are beginning to attribute a swift recent rally in natural gas prices in part to the possibility that a collapse of enron would roil the commodity markets . enron dominates natural gas and electricity trading in the united states . in new york today , natural gas for december delivery fell 0 . 1 cent , to $ 3 . 29 for a million british thermal units . the contract has soared from about $ 2 . 70 over the last two weeks as enron ' s troubles became public . ' ' enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities , ' ' said jay saunders , oil and gas analyst at deutsche banc alex . brown , ' ' and if they ' re at risk financially , then you ' re exposed to that so you want to cover that risk . anybody who has enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid . ' ' mr . saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately , including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter . copyright ? 2000 dow jones metro desk the state calpers is urged to challenge enron finance : the public employee pension fund holds 3 million shares of the energy firm , whose stock has plunged . state senator calls for action . nancy vogel times staff writer 11 / 02 / 2001 los angeles times home edition b - 8 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company sacramento - - a state senator has encouraged the managers of california ' s public employee retirement fund to challenge , perhaps with a lawsuit , the management of enron corp . , the high - flying energy company whose stock has plummeted more than 80 % in the last year . the california public employee retirement system , the nation ' s biggest public pension fund , owns roughly 3 million shares of enron common stock . enron shares , once valued at nearly $ 85 , fell $ 1 . 91 thursday to $ 11 . 99 on the new york stock exchange . sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) urged management of calpers to deal aggressively with the houston - based company , which is being investigated by the securities and exchange commission for a potential conflict of interest by its former chief financial officer . investors have begun complaining of a paucity of information released by enron about its financial transactions , and the stock has fallen dramatically in response . on thursday , a major credit agency , standard & poor ' s , lowered its ratings on enron , dealing the company another financial blow . " it is clear that the events surrounding enron have created a serious lack of confidence in the judgment of enron ' s management team , " peace wrote tuesday in a letter to calpers chief executive james e . burton . " it is , therefore , incumbent on calpers , as trustee of public employees ' ownership rights and as founder of the corporate governance movement , to improve enron ' s corporate governance to increase share value . " in an interview , peace said calpers should consider a shareholder lawsuit or join with other shareholders to force out enron ' s management . calpers provides retirement and health benefits to more than 1 . 2 million state and local public employees and their families . enron officials did not respond to a request for comment on peace ' s letter . calpers officials said they were considering the letter . peace has clashed repeatedly with enron since the early 1990 s , when the company was trying to influence the utility regulators and lawmakers forging a plan to turn california ' s regulated electricity industry into a competitive market . peace chaired the legislative committee that crafted deregulation legislation . " enron wants a market where consumers have limited knowledge , and they want to operate their business where stockholders have the most limited information possible , " peace said in an interview . once a natural gas pipeline company , enron has grown into the world ' s largest energy trader . besides owning enron stock , calpers has joined with the firm to invest in energy development . in 1993 , calpers and enron each contributed $ 250 million to an investment fund guided by enron . when calpers ended the partnership in 1997 and sold its position to enron , it earned $ 125 million , a 23 % return , a calpers spokesman said . they teamed up again in 1998 , with each putting up $ 500 million for energy industry investments . enron tapped $ 150 million of calpers ' money before calpers ' commitment to the partnership expired . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial financing offers lure buyers 11 / 02 / 2001 the washington post final eo 2 copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved thanks to interest - free financing , general motors and ford motor reported sharply higher october auto sales while chrysler saw a more modest rise . gm reported that it sold 546 , 093 vehicles last month , a 31 percent increase over october 2000 . ford sold 400 , 893 vehicles in october , 36 percent more than the same month a year ago . sales of daimlerchrysler ' s chrysler , dodge and jeep brand vehicles were up 5 percent , with just more than 209 , 000 units sold . gm set an all - time monthly record for truck sales , while sales of ford ' s beleaguered explorer suv set an october record . enron gets loan - - at a price enron received a $ 1 billion loan from j . p . morgan chase and salomon smith barney but had to pledge its natural gas pipelines as collateral . pledging the pipelines signals enron ' s desperation to convince shareholders and trading partners that it ' s creditworthy as the securities and exchange commission investigates partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , investors said . questions about enron ' s dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of commercial - paper markets , where most large corporations go to find low - interest , short - term debt . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . companies nov 2 , 2001 by julie earle and john labate nothing has added to enron ' s growth more than its aggressive and dominant position in the trading markets for gas and electricity that the houston - based company helped to create . a decade - long series of bold and innovative moves by enron has not only changed the company but transformed the way us energy companies manage risk and trade energy products from region to region . on any given day enron is the principal in about 25 per cent of the online and offline trades in the energy and natural gas markets , according to analysts ' estimates . with an ongoing investigation by us securities regulators into enron ' s accounting and disclosure practices , and enron ' s market value falling by half in the past two weeks , many are wondering what impact enron ' s mounting troubles could have on the trading markets . analysts say that in the worst case , long - term scenarios , if enron ' s debt is downgraded to junk status or if the company depletes its considerable cash resources , the energy and natural gas markets could be hit in multiple ways . " if you have something as big as enron in a space saying they have no more money , you would have real effects and volatility in the market , " said todd shipman , an analyst at credit rating agency standard & poor ' s . few competitors want to see enron exit the trading markets , however , since it provides so much liquidity to the markets , and fewer expect that to happen . many of enron ' s energy rivals , including dynegy , aquila and duke energy , are also trading partners , or counterparties to enron . as such they may be closely tied to enron ' s fate in the short term . the biggest near - term threat is if there is another change in enron ' s credit status . this week moody ' s investors service downgraded enron to two notches above junk status . further reductions are , for the moment , the main worry among its rivals and trading partners , although enron debt remains at investment - grade levels . " certainly , whenever anybody is downgraded to junk status , their counterparties become concerned about how much credit they will extend , " said gerald keenan , a partner at pwc consulting in chicago .

" we very much appreciate the support of two of our long - standing banking partners , " he said in a statement . " with more than $ 1 billion in cash currently on our balance sheet , this additional credit capacity will further solidify enron ' s standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets .

" the company ' s financial flexibility has continued to diminish . this crisis of investor confidence can be traced . . . directly to the company ' s inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron ' s core energy marketing business and the viability of the company ' s plan to restore its credit profile , " it said . full disclosure " a full , frank disclosure and discussion of the business and financial issues facing the company and its plans to address them will be necessary before investors will be able to confidently evaluate the merits of investing in enron securities , " the agency added . s & p nevertheless said enron ' s liquidity position is " adequate " to see the company through its current problems and that enron was unlikely to see its position as the industry ' s top energy marketer endangered as long as it operated transparently . on monday , moody ' s investors service cut enron ' s long - term debt to " baa 2 , " also two notches above junk , and warned it may cut that rating and enron ' s " prime - 2 " commercial paper rating . enron was once a wall street darling lauded for its ability to create new internet - based commodity markets that produced soaring profits and a stock price that seemed to defy gravity . but setbacks in its bandwidth business and overseas investments , plus problems arising from the california power crisis hurt its do - no - wrong image . and in august , former chief executive jeff skilling shocked the financial world by resigning after just six months on the job , citing personal reasons . the stock , whose year - high was $ 84 , began to sink , then fell off a cliff after the company ' s oct . 16 announcement . that day , shares closed at $ 33 . 84 . trying to shore up its credibility , enron replaced fastow last week with another enron executive , jeff mcmahon . the company said on wednesday an sec " informal inquiry " begun oct . 22 had become a formal investigation , possibly indicating regulators did not like what they had seen . it elected university of texas law school dean william powers to the board of directors and put him in charge of an internal probe into the deals . despite all the bad news of recent weeks , enron said on thursday its core business of energy trading was going strong . enron spokesman eric thode said transactions on the houston - based company ' s widely watched internet enrononline system were averaging some $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day , up from a 30 - day average of $ 2 . 5 billion . enron is by far the nation ' s largest natural gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets . copyright ?

' the sec is investigating partnerships run by former cfo andrew fastow that bought and sold enron shares and assets . those trades cost enron $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity . questions about enron ' s dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of commercial - paper markets , where most large corporations go to find low - interest , short - term debt . last friday , enron tapped a $ 3 billion credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding . proceeds from the $ 1 billion secured loan will go for debt payments and to supplement cash reserves , enron said . business with enron to get the $ 1 billion loan , enron pledged assets of its northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , which own gas pipeline systems that combined are about 19 , 000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic feet of gas a day . enron , based in houston , got its start as a natural gas - pipeline operator . over the past decade , the company has shed assets such as pipelines and power plants and focused on trading electricity , gas , wood pulp and other commodities . enron now accounts for about a quarter of u . s . power and gas trades . the company still has about 25 , 000 miles of gas pipeline . mortgaging those lines is ` ` maybe not such a good signal , ' ' said roger hamilton , who manages john hancock value funds , which owns 600 , 000 enron shares . ` ` it shows they can ' t convince banks with anything but secured assets . ' ' shares of enron fell $ 1 . 91 to $ 11 . 99 . earlier , they dropped to $ 11 . 70 . the stock has fallen 86 percent this year . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell about 3 cents today to be bid at 74 cents on the dollar and offered at 77 cents , traders said . until last week , the notes were trading near par value . credit rating enron must have investment - grade credit to borrow enough to settle its transactions daily . energy companies including exelon corp . and northeast utilities have restricted business with enron as the company sought new sources of credit . on monday , moody ' s investors service lowered enron ' s long - term credit rating to ` ` baa 2 ' ' from ` ` baal , ' ' two notches above junk status . it also placed the company ' s ` ` p - 2 ' ' rating for commercial paper on review for possible downgrade . standard & poor ' s said in downgrading enron ' s credit rating today that the company has enough liquidity to see it through the ` ` current period of uncertainty . ' ' still , s & p said , enron ' s ` ` financial flexibility has continued to diminish ' ' because of its ` ` inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron ' s core energy marketing business . ' ' repayment trigger falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment terms for $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds held by affiliated companies such as the ones created by fastow . a lower credit rating also reduces the amount of cash that enron can raise to back its trading business . ` ` there are still two levels before those triggers go into effect , ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne said . the announcement of today ' s $ 1 billion loan is ` ` the latest step in an orderly plan to strengthen our balance sheet , ' ' she said . denne outlined three steps , which include the credit line and a draw - down of $ 3 billion in unsecured credit , which was announced last week . the final step is $ 2 . 1 billion in asset sales , which the company outlined on a conference call last week . enron said it expects to close on $ 600 million in sales before year ' s end . the sales include enron ' s azurix north america water business to american water works inc . for $ 149 . 8 million , enron ' s puerto rican power - plant company ecoelectrica holdings ltd . to mirant corp . and enron ' s stake in brazilian natural - gas distributor cia . distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro to state - owned brazilian oil company petroleo brasileiro sa , or petrobras . the latter two transactions are valued at $ 250 million each , enron spokesman mark palmer said . s & p said today it doesn ' t think the asset sales and enron ' s other plans will be enough to restore enron ' s credit quality to the ` ` bbb + ' ' level it had since 1995 . investor confidence the financing is to ` ` enhance market and investor confidence , ' ' enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said in a statement . enron can borrow another $ 200 million by bringing other banks into the loan , denne said . ` ` we don ' t have any plans to do so at this point , ' ' she said . ` ` we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating , ' ' mcmahon said . mcmahon , then head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo last week . fastow was ousted in an attempt to restore investor confidence . ` ` it seems until we know more about the sec investigation , it ' s going to be a difficult time for the stock , ' ' said tara gately , an energy analyst at loomis sayles & co . , which sold most of its enron shares early last year . j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of part of azurix . salomon smith barney is the investment - banking arm of citigroup inc . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom , 609 - 750 - 4651 usa : enron u . s . energy trade so far skirts credit woes . by joseph silha 11 / 01 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 1 ( reuters ) - enron corp . , whose shares slumped again on thursday amid investors ' concerns over a credit crunch , has yet to see that fear seriously dent its dealings with other giants of the u . s . gas and power markets . " trading volumes in our core wholesale businesses remain extremely strong . every day this week , volume on enrononline has exceeded our rolling 30 - day average . we are not seeing people hesitate to do business with us , " enron spokesman eric thode said . enron is by far the nation ' s largest natural gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets . the company recently became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships headed by enron ' s former chief financial officer . thode said transactions on the houston - based company ' s widely watched internet enrononline system were averaging some $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day , up from a 30 - day average of $ 2 . 5 billion . business as usual ? while enron ' s dominance of the industry has long been a sore spot with competitors , many of its biggest trading partners said it was business as usual , despite an 80 percent plunge in the company ' s share price since january . but the drain on the company ' s capital has not gone unnoticed , prompting increased caution among traders but few fears the company will exit the north american energy market . " enron has come under closer scrutiny , but we haven ' t changed our policy about dealing with the company . this is a one time event . it ' s a hurricane , but it doesn ' t mean the weather next year will be bad . enron will handle this problem , " al butkus , vice president at utilicorp united , said . butkus noted enron ' s problems stem from how the company financed the purchase of some assets , not from its trading operations . charlotte , n . c . - based duke energy , another large trading partner , also has not curbed its business with enron . " we have a credit process for our counterparties which tells us how much collateral is required . that could come into play if there were further problems with enron ' s credit , but we haven ' t seen that yet , " duke energy spokesman terry francisco said . traders at reliant energy , williams cos . , dynegy and el paso corp all said they continue to deal with enron but were closely monitoring the situation . credit squeeze despite the current calm among energy traders , analysts cautioned enron ' s shrinking capitalization could still squeeze its cash supply and hamper its ability to do business . questions about some off - balance sheet deals with two partnerships helped pummel the company ' s stock this week to its lowest level since 1992 , shrinking market capitalization to less than $ 9 billion from more than $ 60 billion in january . most of enron ' s power and gas deals are in the unregulated over - the - counter ( otc ) market , so no one outside of the company knows what trades are on their books . but enron , the biggest market maker in energy products , has consistently preached a balanced or hedged book . " some people may be scaling back their dealings with enron , but i think you can rely on enron to do what they should do in risk management practices , " ed krapels , director at massachusetts - based energy security analysis inc told reuters . " i think at the end of the day , their book was balanced enough and they should be able to weather the storm . " but krapels cautioned that further deterioration in enron ' s share price and credit standing might force the company to post larger cash deposits with its counterparties and ultimately restrict trading operations . earlier today , merrill lynch lowered its rating on enron ' s stock to " neutral " from " accumulate " . enron ' s shares ended down $ 1 . 91 , or 13 . 7 percent , at $ 11 . 99 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . india press : dabhol creditors meeting in london called off 11 / 01 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones dow jones newswires ; dow jones newswires ; 91 - 11 - 461 - 9426 ; himendra . kumar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

" the commission recognizes that start - up costs in forming a larger rto may be more , but that over the longer term , large rtos will foster market development , will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices . the order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above . the grid south participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next tuesday . it is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of rtos , including independent board requirement , congestion managment , interconnection procedures , planning process and cbm . therefore , i am attaching a summary of the order . one of the important findings of the order is that gridsouth is not sufficiently independent ; the applicant tos are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board . therefore , the order requires gridsouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within 90 days . if anyone wants copies of the orders , let me know . 
2	Subject: new enrononline functionality several changes have been made to stack manager and the website . these changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of monday september 3 , 2001 . stack manager changes activate / inactivate stack - this functionality allows the trader to pull a product ' s prices from the website without suspending the product . if the top of stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product ; therefore , if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website . if a product ' s stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager . if the stack is active it will appear in black font . to use this feature , select the product , right click and choose " inactivate stack " . when you are ready to reactivate your prices , select the same product , right click again and choose " activate stack " . there are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will activate / inactivate the stack of the highlighted product . see screen shot below for the icons . changes to product properties - currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen , the product will be suspended and pulled from the website . now instead of being suspended , the product ' s stack will become inactive . once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the activate stack icon as discussed above . website change restrictions on top of stack orders - if top of stack limit orders are allowed on a product , but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer , limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product . if you have any questions please call me at 31787 . thanks . savita

nwwv is an online auction and e - commerce company which utilizes the internet to maximize profits and savings for it ' s customers recent headlines newave surpasses $ 1 million in record monthly revenue surpassing the one million dollar monthly revenue milestone is a significant achievement in our relatively short history . we are now beginning to experience contribution to our top line from all three operating subsidiaries , onlinesupplier . com , auctionliquidator and discount online warehouse . i believe that given the positive industry outlook , we will continue to experience significant growth as we further develop and integrate the three businesses into one unique and total ecommerce solution . newave ceo michael hill newave launches nationwide advertising campaign with it ' s spokesman bob eubanks television and game show personality bob eubanks , will be featured on multiple television interviews nationwide the interviews are part of a broader national advertising campaign to be followed later this summer with the broadcast of newave ' s inaugural infomercial featuring mr . eubanks . newave ' s ' auctionliquidator ' to manage initial major online ebay charity auction by converging the power of online commerce with philanthropy , we believe we have the ability to develop this concept into a force within the fundraising industry . having recently surpassed over 1 , 000 successful online auctions processed through auctionliquidator , we believe we have just begun to tap into a potentially vast market which is estimated to be approximately $ 10 billion . - christa frankos , vp auctionliquidator newave ' s onlinesupplier . com partners with listen up overflow call center ; expect surge in call volume sales we currently receive approximately 6 - 7 , 000 inbound calls a day at onlinesupplier . com . we expect that number to increase to between 10 - 15 , 000 a day with the launch of our infomercial . michael hill , newave ceo newave ' s ' auctionliquidator ' auctions $ 90 , 000 ' jesse james west coast chopper . auctionliquidator will auction a custom built cherry cfl west coast chopper . the bike is personally autographed by discovery channel ' s monster garage show host jesse james and is 100 % hand made the auction will be listed on ebay through its affiliated non - profit provider missionfish . the retail value of the chopper is approximately $ 90 , 000 and typically buyers have an estimated one year wait . the auction bidding will begin at $ 50 , 000 on june 8 th and close on june 18 th . we believe that our offering is a new and unique option for non profit organizations to raise donations and our stated mission is to become the new standard in non profit fundraising . christa frankos vp auctionliquidator newave announces record annual revenue for 12 months ended december 31 , 2004 we are extremely pleased to have generated almost $ 7 million in revenue in just our first full calendar year of business . . . we are continuing to experience a surge in new memberships to onlinesupplier . com and believe we can effect full scale launches of both auctionliquidator . com and discount online warehouse this year . additionally , with the nationwide broadcast of our first infomercial featuring our celebrity spokesman bob eubanks scheduled for july , we should effectively begin national branding of the newave concept and become a step closer to achieving our mission of providing a fully integrated e - commerce solution for the marketplace . nwwvthe total e - commerce solution nwwv through its 3 subsidiaries utilizes the internet to maximize the income potential and substantial discounted savings for its customers onlinesupplier . com offers organizations of all sizes from home business to large enterprise the ability to create , manage , and maintain effective website solutions for e - commerce since inception in august of 2003 , onlinesupplier . com has serviced over 150 , 000 paid members and received over 2 million inquiries regarding its services ! auctionliquidator is an online portal which provides individuals , enterprise customers and non - profit organizations with a quick and efficient method for selling unwanted items on ebay and other online auction sites since its recent launch , auctionliquidator has surpassed over 1 , 000 successful auctions ! discount online warehouse is an online wholesale club which offers discounted products purchased in bulk quantities to its members challenge : while the u . s . economy has been sluggish , e - commerce has never been hotter ! according to forrester research , u . s . retail e - commerce sales eclipsed $ 136 . 6 billion in 2004 , an increase of 20 % from 2003 . put another way : e - commerce grew three times faster than retail sales as a whole for the same period ! but there is a dark cloud on the horizon . there are more than 22 million small businesses in the u . s . , the vast majority with fewer than a dozen employees . they represent 50 % of the entire u . s . economy and 75 % of all new jobs . . . and yet these businesses find it increasingly difficult to cash in on the e - commerce revolution . it ' s becoming harder and harder to design and maintain online stores . . . set up merchant accounts . . . control web - based inventories . . . and package and ship products . as consumers increasingly demand web catalogs and instant online shopping , millions of small businesses are missing out . without a state of the art web site . . . a wide variety of competitively - priced products and services . . . and cutting - edge ordering and payment options . . . these small businesses and entrepreneurs are losing billions of dollars in potential profits . and because small businesses provide most of the new jobs in america , the ripple effect of this failure to offer online shopping could dramatically slow down the economic recovery of the country as a whole . plus , that ' s only half of the problem . there are millions more people and businesses that would like to sell items on ebay . . . but they either don ' t own computers or don ' t want to be bothered with listing and photographing items on ebay . . nwwv has the ultimate solution fortunately , nwwv has developed easy , cost - effective solutions to these e - commerce challenges ! first : nwwv , through its web portal online supplier . com , helps small businesses and entrepreneurs get in on the e - commerce revolution by providing a turn key online store with dynamic content . . . hundreds of products selling at up to 50 % below retail price . . . access to merchant account services . . . and direct shipping to buyers . for a small monthly fee , nwwv allows businesses to have an instant online retail presence . second : nwwv ' s other subsidiary , auction liquidator , has established a relationship with fedex to provide it with nationwide network of drop - off centers that will let anyone to sell an item on ebay by just dropping it off at any one of the 5 , 000 fedex or kinkos locations without ever touching a computer . auctionliquidator will handle the entire transaction for the seller and simply send him or her a check once the item sells . nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks , longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well - known music impresario . nwwv is currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july 2005 . legendary tv game show host and celebrity personality bob - eubanksof the newlywed game now national spokesman for nwwv 7 big reasons to consider nwwv before its stock could jump from $ 1 . 50 a share to $ 15 1 . nwwv has innovated the e - commerce industry : as a one - stop online wholesaler and e - commerce facilitator , nwwv helps thousands of entrepreneurs and small businesses take advantage of the explosion in online shopping and auctioneering . according to forrester research , e - commerce sales will hit $ 175 billion this year and $ 310 billion by 2010 and nwwv is smack dab in the middle of it . 2 . nwwv ' s online auction drop - off concept could bring in millions of more auction customers and capture a significant portion of a potential $ 10 billion market . ebay itself estimates that several million people would like to sell items on its service but don ' t know how to use computers . a company like nwwv that has established a drop - off presence with fedex and already has an established online auction wholesale business could become the dominant player in a brand - new , growth segment of e - commerce . 3 . nwwv ' s growth has been nothing short of explosive . within three months of its launch in august 2003 , nwwv had monthly sales of $ 348 , 000 . for 2004 nwwv just reported annual sales of $ 6 . 8 million in just their first full calendar year of business and just announced it surpassed over $ 1 million in monthly sales ! 4 . like ebay and ubid , nwwv ' s growth potential is virtually unlimited . a tiny web site with just the right combination of e - commerce solutions and products can grow at an exponential rate . already , nwwv has serviced more than 150 , 000 paid members . . . and is receiving over 6 , 000 new online inquires per day . if only 1 % of them join the nwwv online shopping club , nwwv would triple its rate of growth . 5 . nwwv ' s monthly fee of $ 29 . 95 per month guarantees a steady flow of revenue . this guarantees the company a source of revenue for its ongoing marketing campaigns . as an online wholesale shopping club , nwwv also makes money from sales of the top - quality products offered through its web portal , onlinesupplier . com . 6 . nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks , longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well - known music impresario . nwwv is also currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july 2005 . 7 . by my calculations , nwwv would only need increase annual sales ten - fold to $ 68 million for its stock to potentially skyrocket from $ 1 . 50 a share today to $ 15 a share . it ' s risky , but would turn every $ 10 , 000 invested into almost $ 100 , 000 . if the current growth continues , nwwv could potentially meet sales numbers like that in 24 months or less . is it possible for a new company like nwwv to grow that fast ? you better believe it ! annual sales of $ 68 million represent only a miniscule portion just 0 . 05 % of the $ 136 billion in total e - commerce sales . . . which are growing at the staggering rate of 20 % per year . dear investor : the only sure path to investment wealth is to find breakthrough new companies before anyone else does and buy them when they ' re still dirt cheap . in this special issue , i am blowing the lid on nwwv a brand - new e - commerce company that is in the process of revolutionizing the burgeoning online auction market . it ' s an online shopping club that lets ordinary people set up , maintain and grow their own auction businesses for just pennies a day . and according to forrester research , this year online auctions will represent fully 25 % of a $ 175 billion e - commerce market . read this report and you will discover why i believe nwwv could turn a $ 10 , 000 investment into $ 100 , 000 within just 24 months or sooner ! but don ' t delay . this company already has 150 , 000 members . . . its first calendar year annual sales hit almost $ 7 million ! . . . and is still growing this stock has the potential to be a huge winner . don ' t miss out ! read this valuable special report right away ! sincerely , jack burney , editor welcome to this issue of hitech fortunes ! i don ' t think i ' ve ever been more excited about a stock and that ' s saying a lot . i won ' t kid you , either : this is one of those stocks that may scare off some investors , but which has the potential to make you , not 5 times your money , but 10 or even 20 times your money . it ' s risky , but with potential profits like those , i think it ' s a risk you should consider . back in 1995 , two guys got together in a san jose , california , living room to discuss launching a new online shopping business . they didn ' t want to sell products themselves , like the new company amazon . com . they simply wanted to help people and businesses sell their products to one another . the new web site would make its money from a small upfront fee for using the service . . . and a small percentage of the price of the products sold on the site ( between 1 % and 5 % , depending upon the price ) . most people , of course , thought pierre omi - dyar and jeff skoll were crazy . when their company first went public , its stock only sold for $ 3 a share . talk about a small stock ! but a year later , no one thought they were crazy . every $ 10 , 000 invested in ebay grew into $ 166 , 000 in 12 months . and after just nine years in business , ebay today has 100 million registered users , a total market cap of $ 52 billion and annual net revenues in excess of $ 3 billion . i only bring this up to remind you of the astonishing potential of the right e - commerce stock . quite frankly , most of them never get off the ground . the dot . com bust taught us that a bright idea is not enough , that you have to have a solid business plan and substantial growth in revenues to create a winner . but when you do find a winner , the profits you can make are simply outstanding . the company i am going to introduce to you in this issue is just such a breakthrough e - commerce stock . it has the potential to become another huge winner . it is the first company i know of to combine the concepts of wholesale shopping clubs and drop - off consignment stores with the exponential power of e - commerce and internet auctions . like ebay , it makes its money both from membership fees as well as from a percentage of the actual sales on its web sites and through its drop - off consignment stores . and its sales are growing at a rate of more than 21 % . . . per month . i ' ve seen just how fast an e - commerce business can take off when it has the right concept at the right time . i believe this new stock is just such a company . get ready for yet another potential huge winner !

2	Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit , virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 , geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise , on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation . the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data . capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company . in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 . as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area . a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market . conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream . for additional information , visit investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

2	Subject: our track record proves we offer research that builds your wealth wall street breaking news kidsational , inc . otc symbol : kdsc . pk current price : $ . 20 estimated 30 - day high : . 70 estimated 12 - month high ( w / movie release ) : $ 2 . 50 news flash : wall street breaking news discovers leading edge entertainment company preparing for blockbuster new release ! kdsc positioned as the # 1 investment in children ' s entertainment for years to come . over the past decade , disney and warner brothers have perfected a proven formula in the entertainment industry that consistently delivers over $ 100 million per film release . box office results have shown that animated features and movies geared toward a younger audience are genuine profit makers with movie - goers starved for quality g - rated family entertainment . by enhancing this model for success , kidsational , inc . ( kdsc ) is building a solid platform in the most profitable segment of all mainstream movies - typically 5 x more profitable than a big production film . through skillful management and product depth , kdsc is rapidly becoming a diversified entertainment empire , poised to become one of the leaders in this industry . kdsc ' s initial motion picture is entitled the guardians - masters of the electro - world , based on adolescent super heroes along the lines of mighty morphin power rangers and teenage mutant ninja turtles , who have collectively produced revenues exceeding $ 500 million . one clear advantage for kdsc is that the guardians is scheduled to feature tv and movie industry stars , giving the film that extra boost of mass appeal . kdsc ' s theater release is based upon the theme and characters in the nationally available guardian ' s board game ( 100 % owned by kdsc ) which is used in over 400 elementary schools and has been featured on a major nationally syndicated afternoon tv talk show . judging by the numbers , major full length films of this type that reach out not just to kids but entire families , have enjoyed huge box office success . this is based on a release of over 1 , 000 screens , right in line with company expectations for their premier in just the us alone . but the box office revenues are only a fraction of the huge income that is typically realized from a film . to maximize profits everything from action figures , clothing , and toys , to children ' s party favors and lunch boxes are scheduled for national merchandising in order to extend the brand and generate revenue . if this were the whole story , it would be more than enough to justify a strong buy recommendation for kdsc . however , this isn ' t even the tip of the iceberg . the really big income will most likely be in vcr / dvd sales after the movie has run in theaters . anyone who has small children or grandchildren knows that the vcr / dvd is today ' s electronic baby sitter . children watch films over and over again memorizing all the songs and story lines . it is very realistic by today ' s standards to see video and dvd sales hit the $ 100 million mark , especially with the availability at retail super - stores and the internet . one of the most magnificent facts about children ' s movies is that a new generation is born every 7 years to enjoy re - releases as well as home video . kdsc has cemented partnerships that will enhance their entertainment products , increase distribution channels , and accelerate growth . dynamic gains are realized in the early growth stages of a burgeoning entertainment company that has nailed the blueprint for success . savvy investors with an eye for value can benefit from the tremendous profits that will launch the fortunes of this new film and entertainment powerhouse . please read this required disclosure : wall street breaking news ( wsbn ) is delivered online on a monthly basis . all information is derived from publicly available sources . performance forecasts made on behalf of wsbn are strictly projections based upon news aggregation . wsbn is an independent research publication that provides investment - research reports on independently selected companies . while our intent is to identify companies that may provide substantial investment profits , wsbn is not liable for any investment decision by its readers . wsbn has been retained for a fee of seven thousand dollars and will not hold , purchase , or otherwise participate in the trading of any featured company . any report published by wsbn does not represent a solicitation to buy or sell the securities discussed within the report . it is advised that any purchase or sale decisions be discussed with a financial advisor or broker . past performance does not insure future success of any featured company . wsbn cautions that substantial risks are present when investing in low - priced securities .

2	Subject: our hot picks triple on excellent bounce hot otc stock picks our hot picks were up over 300 % for 2004 here is our first hot pick for 2005 subscribers , investors , analysts , stock brokers : urgent stock breakout alert american idc corp . otc : acni price : . 04 target : . 20 in 7 days major breaking news : acni launches broadband internet tv , technologically superior to aol tv clips and movie trailers . investors brace for worldwide revenue explosion . without hype or fanfare , acni has not only put itself on top of the list for revolutionary internet success stories , it has completely re - written the qualifying criteria . acni has completed the worldwide launch of its revolutionary broadband internet television , solidifying explosive revenues for this proprietary video technology powerhouse . while most investors are completely unaware of this significant achievement , that will change very quickly . acni is positioned much like today ' s cable tv giants that invested heavily in their technology over 20 years ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initially spent each year from their current subscribers . the driving force behind acni ' s technology that enables streaming 24 / 7 broadband internet television , by comparison , is more highly sophisticated than the partial movie trailers or 15 - second clips from " top tv moments " shown by aol to subscribers . combine the fact that acni is continuously providing thousands of revenue generating hollywood classic movies , with expanding content of sports , music , educational , television series , and children ' s programming , clearly provides a superior cutting - edge advantage keeping the company at the forefront in the fastest growing sector of the internet . acni ' s programming through its 100 % company - owned network , e - tvhollywood , is the first full - screen broadband digital streaming channel on the internet in high - definition ( hd ) quality . the technological breakthrough that supplies the groundwork for record setting multi - millions for acni is powered by mpeg 2 using movie industry code which allows for the necessary transcoding into video for broadband . acni is the perfect play for explosive short - term gains with a small float estimated at under 20 million shares and a market value at around $ 1 . 5 million . we expect massive block buying with record setting price and volume breakouts . we are advising urgent accumulation by our subscribers as huge news is due to be released that will send share prices soaring . required acni information : hot otc stock picks is an independent newsletter with the goal of giving investors the necessary knowledge to make rational and profitable investment decisions . this publication does not provide an analysis of the company ' s financial position and is not an offer to buy or sell securities . investing in securities is speculative and carries risk . it is recommended that any investment should be made after consulting with your investment advisor and after reviewing the financial statements of the company . hot otc stock picks presents information in this online report believed to be reliable , but its accuracy cannot be assured . past performance does not insure similar future results . hot otc stock picks received fifteen thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party with respect to the preparation of this special online report as an effort to build investor awareness for american idc corp . the information reported herein contains future - looking statements and information within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 e of the securities exchange act of 1934 , including statements regarding expected continual growth of the featured company . future - looking statements are based on expectations , estimates , and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated .

" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

2	Subject: var for cob 2 nd aug 2000 hi vince , i was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the full mailing list . basically it suggests that the copper option position may well have increased the var by more than $ 500 , 000 . however , given that the portfoilo has also changed from the lst of august it is difficult to asses the actual change due to the option only . regards kirstee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by kirstee hewitt / lon / ect on 03 / 08 / 2000 17 : 29 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - enron europe from : kirstee hewitt 03 / 08 / 2000 16 : 29 to : cantekin dincerler / hou / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : var for cob 2 nd aug 2000 hi all , the cu option position has entered the mg books for the 2 nd aug . the delta is 35299 $ / mt for dec 2000 . the cu var has gone up from $ 2 , 245 , 000 to $ 3 , 306 , 000 . i estimated that the portfolio for the lst would increase to approx $ 3 , 039 , 000 so this seems sensible . the overall var change is from $ 4 , 780 , 796 to $ 5 , 991 , 569 . again , the estimate for the lst aug was for an increase in var to ~ $ 5 , 476 , 000 . all estimates were based on a delta of 32 , 0004 / dmt . there has also been some increase in the var for aluminium which will effect the overall total . a summary is as follows : regards , kirstee 
2	Subject: working paper list & etc dear vince : i have put together a list of finance working papers ( some of which i brought to the interview last wednesday ) which i have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also ( at least initially ) as a learning tool . several of them , however , do contain innovations . i have asked ms . de claris to forward a copy to you . as i expressed to you earlier i am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn . i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us . i do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market . this would be an area that i am also very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of the players in the street . the question in my mind ( hopefully not prematurely ) is : if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business ? i look forward to hearing from you soon . best regards joao

" the ferc agenda will apparently examine at least four price mitigation cases california filed with ferc : ? extending ferc ' s current price mitigation efforts to all wscc states and amending the current price limits applicability - - now in effect only during stage three power emergencies in california - - to 24 hours a day , seven days a week . ? requiring power generators in the entire western region to sell available electricity to california or into their local power grids during emergencies , reducing the threat of blackouts . ? establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times . some companies that have long - term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity . ? expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies . that refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies . attached below is rep . tauzin ' s letter to commissioner hebert and likewise hrl 974 .

2	Subject: mark - to - market bob , i wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you about on the phone . i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince ' s group explain the transaction to you . krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here . he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would like you to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market . please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may need to repeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that we would like to have mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through mauritius , and then caymen islands . another key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in india , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income showing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get treated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us . i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of the income is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f and other concerns ) . finally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to indian corporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about , and will brief you on the same . krishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here . look forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting project for us all . regards , sandeep .

" the issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues . panel one : mandatory rto markets the morning panel consisted of the following participants : peter cramton ( university of maryland ) , david hadley ( indiana psc ) , mark kleinginna ( ormet ) , john meyer ( reliant ) , john o ' neal ( mirant ) , and roy shanker ( consultant for generators in the northeast ) . energy spot market there was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the rto must run a real time energy , or spot , market . most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid - based , security - constrained system with economic dispatch . in response to a question from pat wood , most also agreed that nodal ( lmp ) pricing should be used in the spot market , although john meyer from reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ercot and that works also . day ahead market and balanced versus unbalanced schedules most of the panelists said that the rto should not require balanced schedules . peter cramton said that with a day - ahead market , no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior . john meyer agrees , saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement , then there might be a need for a day - ahead market . john notes that ercot has a balanced schedule requirement . john also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system . roy shanker also said ferc needs either a balanced schedules requirement ( which he does not recommend ) or have a day - ahead market . icap requirement most of the panelists ( except peter cramton - - university of md ) support an icap requirement . however , none of the panelists could point to an effective icap market ( roy shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the icap proceeding due later this week ) . mark from ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time . mark said liquidity in pjm does not help him move power to the midwest since the rules are undefined outside of pjm . he cannot enter into long - term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out . he also said you can have an icap market but market participants have to be able to meet icap requirements through load response . standardized markets most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day - ahead energy markets , spinning and non - spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized . massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits . roy shanker said the northeast works so ferc should not change it . even if ferc does not require standardization between the rtos , creating large rtos and fixing the problems within the rtos will be a big improvement . mark with ormet and the indiana commissioner both urged ferc to standardize the mandatory markets among the rtos . panel two : optional rto markets the afternoon panel consisted of the following participants : fiona woolfe ( lawyer with experience in england and wales pool ) ; roy thilly ( wisconsin public power inc . ) ; richard pierce ( professor at george washington ) ; glen arthur ( connecticut psc ) ; steve naumann ( commonwealth edison ) ; ed cazalet ( apx ) . this panel was intended to cover optional market issues , including whether a day - ahead market is needed and whether there should be icap markets . this panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market , market monitoring , and other issues . mandatory markets other than ed cazalet ( apx ) , the other panelists for the most part agree that the rto should run a real time and day - ahead energy market , ancillary services markets , and there must be an icap requirement . ed cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market ( perhaps with balanced schedules requirements ) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create . icap most of the panelists believe that the rto should provide a day - ahead market , congestion management and ancillary services . most also favor an icap requirement and market . pat wood said he is not convinced that a blanket icap requirement is needed on day one . he has been considering an icap requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached , and perhaps that should be considered here as well . he has also been talking with a northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not . shelton cannon ( staff ) asked the panelists to assume one midwest rto - can there be different icap requirements within the rto ? most panelists agree that if the icap rules are the same within the rto , that there could be percentage requirement deviations . day two of rto week focuses on congestion management in the morning and transmission planning and expansion in the afternoon . we will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow . please call me with questions or comments . sarah

" shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement . clauses related to a " material adverse change , " also known as a " material adverse effect , " have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year , due , in part , to the stock market ' s fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions . but such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove . both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal , much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins . furthermore , a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can ' t easily walk away from a merger . in that case , meat - processing concern tyson foods inc . sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat - packer ibp inc . due to a drop in ibp ' s earnings and a write - down of an ibp subsidiary . but a delaware judge refused to let tyson cancel the pact , saying tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of ibp ' s business and the accounting issue . in a lengthy june 18 opinion , delaware chancery court vice chancellor leo e . strine jr . wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company has suffered a material adverse effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company ' s earnings power over a commercially reasonable period , which one would think would be measured in years rather than months . " that interpretation has created ripples in the deal - making community , prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated . since the sept . 11 attacks , for example , a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a " material adverse change , " or mac . a key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is " whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup , " says meredith brown , co - chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm debevoise & plimpton in new york . he adds that a court " may be skeptical " if dynegy claimed that enron ' s post - merger agreement disclosures were a surprise . the enron - dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination . enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer , although it is prohibited from soliciting one . in such a case , it could be required to pay a $ 350 million " topper fee " to dynegy and its co - investor , chevrontexaco inc . dynegy can alter the deal if enron faces " pending or threatened " litigation liabilities that are " reasonably likely " to cost enron $ 2 billion . if those liabilities hit $ 3 . 5 billion " an enron material event will be deemed to have occurred , " presumably allowing dynegy to call the whole thing off . in some situations , dynegy would be liable for a $ 350 million fee , as well . karen denne , the enron spokeswoman , said her firm doesn ' t believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event . the liability must result from litigation . currently , the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors , issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses . deal makers who aren ' t involved in the combination say the steep drop in enron ' s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn ' t by itself give dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force enron to renegotiate its terms . instead , they say , dynegy would likely have to prove that enron ' s worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event , which could be difficult in light of the company ' s highly publicized problems and dynegy ' s frequent statement that it clearly understands enron ' s businesses . still , there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow dynegy to terminate the deal if " any representation or warranty of enron shall have become untrue .

' ' watson , 51 , has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet . if he can pull it off , the new dynegy will have revenues of more than $ 200 billion and $ 90 billion in assets , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of power - generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline . it would control an estimated 20 % to 25 % of the energy - trading market , up from about 6 % now . that would be sweet vindication for watson ' s strategy . dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants , which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer . in contrast , enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil - and gas - generating fields , believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel , pulp , and paper . irresistible bargain . as enron ' s stock slid below $ 9 from its august , 2000 , high of $ 90 , it became a bargain that watson couldn ' t pass up . it would have taken years for dynegy to build up a market - making operation to match enron ' s . its risk - management systems are top - of - the - line . enron ' s commercial - services unit , which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as wendy ' s international inc . , is three or four years ahead of dynegy ' s , says steve bergstrom , president of dynegy . watson says he still plans to get rid of the $ 8 billion worth of assets lay had earmarked for sale , including the portland ( ore . ) general electric plant and oil and gas assets in india . for the $ 1 . 5 billion , though , if the deal falls through dynegy will have the right to enron ' s prized northern natural gas pipeline , worth an estimated $ 2 . 25 billion . and dynegy can walk away if enron ' s legal liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion . watson firmly believes that enron suffered from a crisis of confidence , not a meltdown of its core business . indeed , enron ' s wholesale - trading operation earned $ 2 . 3 billion last year . says watson : ` ` we know the business . we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we thought it was . ' ' but the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by enron ' s accounting tricks . the biggest danger for watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away . already , the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997 by $ 591 million , or 20 % of its total , to account for controversial partnerships involving enron officials . the securities some compare it to a fraternity . dynegy ' s decision to issue new stock options to some enron employees may soothe battered egos . it should help , too , that lay decided not to take the $ 60 million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout . as it is , lay will not have a management job with the new company . dynegy often seemed to be an enron wannabe , following it into online trading and commercial services . still , dynegy ' s 361 % stock gains last year eclipsed enron ' s 87 % rise , and it rankled some that lay ' s execs got more credit . ` ` chuck watson may not have been in the spotlight , but he has always been at the forefront of this business , ' ' says bruce m . withers , who sold his trident ngl inc . to dynegy in 1995 . watson will get more attention next year - - he ' s a 15 % owner of the new houston texans pro football team . but with his bold takeover of enron , watson has ensured that he ' s off the sidelines for good . photograph : dynegy ' s watson he says enron ' s core business is strong . but others worry that more accounting tricks will turn up photograph by najlah feanny / corbis saba illustration : chart : powering up at dynegy chart by laurel daunis - allen / bw copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . cover story confused about earnings ? you ' re not alone . here ' s what companies should do - - and what investors need to know by nanette byrnes and david henry with mike mcnamee in washington 11 / 26 / 2001 businessweek 76 ( copyright 2001 mcgraw - hill , inc . ) in an age when giant earnings write - offs have become commonplace , it ' s hard to shock wall street . but on nov . 8 , enron corp . managed to do it . after years of high - octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24 % a year , the houston - based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half - billion dollars . it was confirmation of investors ' worst fears . three weeks earlier , enron had announced a big drop in shareholders ' equity , sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance . management pointed to a number of factors , including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion - dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company ' s net worth . enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases , but it is hardly alone . this year , corporate america is expected to charge off a record $ 125 billion , much of it for assets , investments , and inventory that aren ' t worth as much as management thought ( chart , page 79 ) . even if companies don ' t go back and restate earnings , as enron is doing , those charges cast doubt on the record - breaking earnings growth of the late ' 90 s . not since the 1930 s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue - - and so difficult for investors to determine . there ' s more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers . if even the most sophisticated financial minds can ' t figure out what a company actually earns , that has implications far beyond enron . u . s . financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build . it has made the u . s . the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest . it has also ensured ready access to capital for u . s . corporations . that a company such as enron , a member of the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index and one of the largest companies on the new york stock exchange , could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished . ` ` the profession of auditing and accounting is , in fact , in crisis , ' ' says paul a . volcker , former chairman of the federal reserve and now one of the leaders of the international accounting standards board . sometimes , as in the case of enron , fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings . more often , though , the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways - - and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies , which appear under a variety of names , from ` ` pro forma ' ' to ` ` core . ' ' ( enron offers its own such version . before investors untangled the importance of enron ' s first announcement , its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ` ` recurring net income ' ' had met expectations . ) the resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing : what did my company earn ? why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place ? because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company ' s prospects . many institutional investors , most wall street analysts , and even many accountants say gaap is irrelevant . ` ` i don ' t know anyone who uses gaap net income anymore for anything , ' ' says lehman brothers inc . accounting expert robert willens . the problem is that gaap includes a lot of noncash charges and one - time expenses . while investors need to be aware of those charges , they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations . that ' s what operating earnings are supposed to do . but because they ' re calculated in an ad hoc manner , with each company free to use its own rules , comparisons between companies have become meaningless . ` ` no investor - - certainly not any ordinary investor - - can read these in a way that ' s useful , ' ' says harvey l . pitt , chairman of the securities & exchange commission . the sec is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas . what ' s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income . in the end , investors need two numbers - - a standardized operating number and an audited net - income number - - and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other . ` ` out of hand . ' ' a widespread consensus is building to do just that . in early november , s & p proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings . only the week before , the financial accounting standards board , the rulemakers for gaap , had announced that they , too , would be taking up this issue . volcker says the international accounting standards board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings . ` ` over the past two or three years , the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand , ' ' says david m . blitzer , s & p ' s chief investment strategist . ` ` earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they ' re trying to evaluate a company . if people want to use an operating - earnings measure , we better all know what we ' re looking at . ' ' without those standards in place , the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to wall street is only going to grow wider and more confusing . look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the s & p 500 for the third quarter : it ' s $ 10 . 78 according to wall street analysts as tallied by thomson financial / first call , $ 9 . 17 according to s & p , and $ 6 . 37 according to numbers reported to the sec under gaap . ( s & p , like businessweek , is owned by the mcgraw - hill companies . ) the lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong . use first call ' s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price - earnings ratio of 23 for the s & p 500 . but run the numbers using gaap earnings , and suddenly the market has a far steeper p - e of 38 . how did we get into this mess ? investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years , and for years , reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it . then came the dot - com bubble , along with increased pressure from wall street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts . suddenly , companies that hadn ' t turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants . these customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit . ` ` tower of babel . ' ' pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company , casting doubt on their validity . and these days , the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever . s & p ' s tallies fall between the two : s & p ' s numbers are more systematic than pro forma , but they aren ' t followed widely enough to be a standard . ` ` investors are facing a tower of babel , ' ' says robert k . elliott , former chief of the american institute of certified public accountants ( aicpa ) and a retired kpmg partner . ` ` it ' s not standardized , and the numbers are not audited . ' ' that makes it tough to evaluate a company ' s performance . in the quarter ended on sept . 30 , nortel networks corp . offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from . by conservative gaap accounting , the telecommunications giant lost $ 1 . 08 a share . the company also provided two possible pro forma options : a 68 cents loss that excluded ` ` special charges , ' ' including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges , and a still better 27 cents loss that further excluded $ 1 . 9 billion of ` ` incremental charges , ' ' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables . wall street chose the rosiest one . confusing ? you bet . companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they ' re merely filling a void : investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company ' s future . the goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations . ` ` there are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings , ' ' says volcker . ` ` it is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company . ' ' besides , as companies like to point out , they still have to report gaap earnings , and investors are free to ignore everything else . there ' s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of gaap than the $ 50 billion asset write - downs by jds uniphase corp . , the biggest charge of the year . near the height of the telecom bull market in july , 2000 , the san jose ( calif . ) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor sdl inc . for $ 41 billion in stock . when the deal closed in february , its assets ballooned from $ 25 billion to $ 65 billion . but by then , shares of jds and other fiber - optics makers were collapsing . to bring its acquisitions into line with their new value , the company took charges of $ 50 billion . despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid , gaap required that the charges be taken out of net income . so according to gaap , jds lost $ 56 billion in the fiscal year ending in june - - a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only $ 5 billion . analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash , the charge - off was all about the past , a right - sizing of values that had gotten out of hand . to analyze the company ' s prospects , they excluded the $ 50 billion charge . ` ` the accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened , ' ' says jds uniphase chief financial officer anthony r . muller , ` ` and we ' ll live with the consequences , whatever they are . ' ' analysts make a similar defense . ` ` my goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company , ' ' says lehman brothers analyst arnab chanda . glacial pace . are jds ' s pro forma numbers realistic - - a fair gauge of jds ' s ongoing operations ? right now , it ' s hard for investors to judge . and that ' s the kind of ambiguity s & p and others would like to eliminate . in november , s & p circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings . under the proposal , operating earnings would include the costs of purchases , research and development , restructuring costs ( including severance ) , write - downs from ongoing operations , and the cost to the company of stock options . it would exclude merger - and - acquisition expenses , impairment of goodwill , litigation settlements , and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset . when s & p applied roughly that formula to jds uniphase , it split the difference between wall street and gaap . because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations , the results were chaotic . using gaap , the company lost $ 9 . 39 a share . s & p figures it lost $ 3 . 19 , while the company put the loss at 36 cents . meanwhile , wall street says it made 2 cents . the s & p standard may make sense , but it raises the question : where is the financial accounting standards board , the group in charge of gaap ? chairman edmund l . jenkins says fasb will be addressing the problems . still , investors shouldn ' t expect any improvement soon . the pace of change at fasb tends to be glacial . it typically takes four years to complete a new standard . in 1996 , for example , the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda . in june , 2000 , the board finally issued a draft of a new standard , asked for comments , and held a public hearing . in october , 2001 , the board said it still wasn ' t ready to put a fix in place . now , the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges , and the fasb still doesn ' t have new rules . the slow pace means the standard - setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market . the most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on september 11 . an fasb task force , unable to come up with a set of rules for separating september 11 costs from general expenses , instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item . so gaap earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company ' s general performance . many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press releases . many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter . indeed , 2001 is shaping up to be one for the record books . a poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of september 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen . but there ' s a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one - time charges . the temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now , while investors are braced for bad news . not only can managers sweep away yesterday ' s errors , but tomorrow ' s earnings will look even better . the basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense - - a charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a company ' s performance . usually , big charges fall into a few categories , including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company , charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased , charges for investments that have lost value , and charges for inventory that has become obsolete . in a recent study , harvard business school professor mark t . bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual . that gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations . lots of critics disagree , saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company ' s earnings history . they certainly should not be ignored by investors . ` ` charges are real shareholder wealth that ' s been lost , ' ' argues david w . tice , manager of the prudent bear fund , a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that ' s up 17 % so far this year . ` ` it ' s money they spent on something no longer worth what it was , a correction of past earnings , or a reserve for costs moving forward . whatever the reason , it ' s a real cost to the company , and that hurts shareholders . ' ' without standards , excessive write - offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance . without any rules , companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light . dell computer corp . is a good example of this ` ` heads i win , tails you lose ' ' school of accounting . for years , dell benefited from gains in its venture - capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings , where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement . but this year , when those gains turned to losses , the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $ 260 million drag . dell spokesman michael maher says the company ' s press releases and sec filings break out investment income and give gaap numbers as well as pro forma . ` ` in our view , the numbers are reported clearly , ' ' says maher . ` ` it ' s all out there for the consuming public . ' ' past puffery . many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated . what should investors make of a company such as gateway inc . ? two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters , minus a small extraordinary gain , totaled $ 1 . 12 billion , or about $ 100 million more than the company made in 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 combined . which is the truer picture of its performance and potential ? the write - offs or the earnings ? write - offs for customer financing are another example . when nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by $ 767 million in september , it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldn ' t pay - - in effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods . in addition , nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues . tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write - offs . and these aren ' t isolated examples . peter l . bernstein , publisher of newsletter economics & portfolio strategy , found that from 1989 to 1993 , 20 % of earnings vanished into write - offs . big charge - offs can also distort future performance . critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of ` ` cookie jar ' ' from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet wall street ' s expectations . or charges taken this year , for example , which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway , might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods . prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings . rules for figuring operating earnings would help , but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgment - - and therefore invite a certain amount of abuse . ` ` people are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because they ' re having a bad year anyway , ' ' says robert g . atkins , a mercer management consultant . part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off , believing that with the bad news out in the open , the company is poised for a brighter future . since gateway detailed its third - quarter charge of $ 571 million on oct . 18 , wall street has bid the stock up 48 % , compared with a 6 % runup for the s & p 500 . often , though , investors should take exactly the opposite message . if , for example , part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training , information - technology spending , or research and development , the cuts could depress future performance , says baruch lev , a professor of accounting at the stern school of business at new york university . ` ` are these really one - time events ? ' ' he asks . ` ` or is this the beginning of an avalanche ? ' ' indeed , morgan stanley dean witter & co . strategist steve galbraith has found that in the year following a big charge - off to earnings companies have underperformed the stock market by 20 percentage points . ` ` la la land . ' ' investors are apt to be faced with more huge write - offs next year , even if the economy doesn ' t continue to worsen . why ? the transition to a new gaap rule that changes the way companies account for goodwill - - a balance - sheet asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets . under the new rule , companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls . an informal survey by financial executives international of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charges . but figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task . unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price , valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules . ` ` what this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment , ' ' says the stern school ' s professor paul r . brown . ` ` it ' s la la land . ' ' while the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games , it could also be an impetus for change - - especially in the wake of the dot - com fiasco . indeed , there are some signs of a backlash . the real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings , with its ` ` funds from operations , ' ' or ffo . but now some reits have begun to revert to plain old gaap earnings . hamid r . moghadam , ceo of san francisco - based amb property corp . , shifted back to gaap in 1999 . ` ` the reason i don ' t like ffo is very simple , ' ' says moghadam . ` ` one company ' s numbers look better than another one ' s even if they had identical fundamental results . ' ' there are other steps fasb could take to improve financial reporting and restore gaap ' s status . trevor s . harris , an accounting expert at morgan stanley , says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income from operations and income from financial transactions . lehman ' s willens says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear on earnings . an easy step would be to require companies to file their press releases with the sec . at the least , says lev , companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the gaap numbers . otherwise , he says , investors ` ` see numbers floating there , and where did they come from ? ' ' in today ' s environment of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write - offs , no question is more important to investors . high - gloss glossary companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin on their results . here ' s what those terms mean : defining earnings : net income the bottom line , according to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) . sometimes called ` ` reported earnings , ' ' these are the numbers the securities & exchange commission accepts in its filings . operating earnings an adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelated to the ongoing business . although it sounds deceptively like a gaap figure called ` ` operating income ' ' ( revenue minus the costs of doing business ) , it is not an audited figure . core earnings another term for operating earnings . neither core nor operating earnings are calculated according to set rules . they can include or exclude anything the preparer wishes . pro forma earnings the 1990 s term for operating earnings . popularized by dot - coms , it sometimes excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest . ebitda earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization . the granddaddy of pro forma , it was initially highlighted by industries that carried high debt loads , such as cable tv , but has since come to be widely quoted . adjusted earnings a new term for pro forma . defining costs : special charges a general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections . asset impairments charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its current market value . many companies are now taking these charges on internal venture - capital funds that bought internet and other high - tech stocks at inflated prices . goodwill impairments the same idea as asset impairments except they ' re used to write down the premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired . these charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because of a change in mergers - and - acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values . restructuring reserves an accrued expense ( not usually cash ) to cover future costs of closing down a portion of a business , a plant , or of firings . these are projected costs and if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed . write - down lowering the value of an asset , such as a plant or stock investment . it is often excused as a bookkeeping exercise , but there may have been a real cost long ago that now proves ill spent , or there may have been associated cash costs , such as investment - banking fees . illustration : chart : the big bath chart by eric hoffmann / bw illustration : chart : earnings chaos chart by eric hoffmann / bw copyright ?

in part , blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of corporate america . the u . s . needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance . without integrity in financial reporting , the u . s . cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace ( page 76 ) . the dot - com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards . companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations . wall street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in . soon , the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company . it is now chaos . a stricter adherence to accounting rules won ' t solve the entire problem . gaap , the generally accepted accounting principles , allow all kinds of one - time expenses and noncash charges . this obscures the performance of ongoing operations . no one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense . the result is total confusion . take earnings per share for the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index for the second quarter . under thomson financial / first call standards , it is $ 11 . 82 . but it ' s $ 9 . 02 according to s & p and $ 4 . 83 under gaap . how can investors make intelligent decisions ? the financial accounting standards board clearly is failing to do its job . it has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings , but it hasn ' t delivered . the rating agency standard & poor ' s ( owned by the mcgraw - hill companies , as is businessweek ) is doing a better job . it recently drew up a definition of ` ` operating earnings ' ' that includes restructuring costs ( including severance ) , writedowns from ongoing operations , and the cost of stock options . it excludes merger and acquisition expenses , litigation settlements , impairment of goodwill , and gains or losses on asset sales . this is a beginning that fasb should build on . the accounting anarchy has to end . copyright ?

[ after sept . 11 ] , they sold at the low , and fear was the driver . just a year and a half ago , the driving emotion was greed . you ' re not going to avoid this stuff . so the issue is how you manage through these cycles of fear and greed . even when i ' m fearful of something , i say to myself : " this is still the time to invest . " my biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say , " i just don ' t want to be in the stock market at all . " and it ' s just the time that people should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio . some other mistakes : a lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poster child of the last cycle . or people say , " i ' ll get back in [ the market ] when i see the economy turn around .

" james lam , founder of erisk , a consulting firm . as an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks , i have been an admirer of enron ' s elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices . and yet , in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid - october , it lost two - thirds of its share value , became the subject of a us securities exchange commission ( sec ) investigation , and was taken over by a rival a third in size . ( latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through . ) what went wrong ? no , the events had nothing to do with dabhol . indeed , if , for us in india , enron will always be associated with the controversial power project , elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting , finance and general management . ( on second thoughts , even its indian adventures would make an excellent case study ! ) but first , a recount of what happened . after announcing on october 16 , without much explanation or transparency , that it has taken a charge of $ 1 . 2 billion against equity , enron ' s share price started tumbling . apparently , the charge was the result of some financial transactions , and the sec launched an investigation . the chief financial officer ( cfo ) , who was directly involved with the transactions , the company ' s treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked . perhaps most damagingly , enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards , reducing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount . as a result , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded . it seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading , but in its investment activities controlled by the cfo . these comprised private equity , and enron ' s share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts . to this end , outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in enron itself , should the value of the investee company ( ies ) fall below agreed threshold ( s ) . all this was done to keep the losses in investments off - balance sheet , and mitigate their impact on reported profits . many other us corporations including j p morgan chase , which had large private equity investments , have suffered on this score ( see world money october 15 ) . enron wanted to avoid this and , last year , paid its since - dismissed cfo $ 30 million for his creative accounting genius . incidentally , those enamoured of us gaap and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company ' s auditors one of the big five firms , which was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by enron last year . the restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the enron management / board and the auditors were forced , on review , to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on , rather than off , balance sheet . details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out , but what has come out is bad enough . but this apart , a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ( $ 300 billion ) or cash flow ( $ 3 billion ) of enron is , by itself , hardly a death warrant . but it turned out to be just that for enron . perhaps because it was too arrogant ? perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors ' confidence was always somewhat fragile ? but there are two other points worth noting : the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing . as for the first , the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts , but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject . perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the " masters of the universe " did , not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars . the enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas , with skilling , the former ceo , claming that " we are on the side of angels . we are taking on the entrenched monopolies . we are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world . " ( the quotation is from an interview in businessweek , prior to skilling ' s inglorious exit from enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst ) . for the analysts , there was also safety in numbers . skilling claimed that " enron ' s operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies " , bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas ! obviously , the fate of long term capital management has not led to more sober management of trading risks . surely the role of " markets " should be to reduce the distance , and cost , between producer and consumer ? one does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values , in terms of compensation , the trader ( don ' t forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator ) over the producer whether in the bond , currency or power and gas markets . the markets and , indeed , greed obviously have a role to play , but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left ? copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . india ' s mehta comments on birla group offer to buy enron stake 2001 - 11 - 26 03 : 42 ( new york ) mumbai , nov . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - jaywantiben mehta , india ' s union minister of state for power , comments on reports of aditya birla group , which owns grasim industry ltd . , the nation ' s third - biggest cement maker , bidding for enron ' s stake in dabhol power co . enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in dabhol power , india ' s biggest foreign investment , at cost . the project is mired in a tariff dispute over $ 64 million in bills that haven ' t been paid by the maharashtra state electricity board , its only customer , for eight months . ` ` one more bidder will increase competition , which is welcome . ` ` any step in the national interest is good . ` ` cheap energy is always in the national interest since we want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a reasonable price . ` ` i can ' t comment on the time - frame of buying out the enron stake until the legal wrangles are solved . once that ' s cleared , then we will try and clear the proposal quickly .

2	Subject: western market crisis : gas joins power - cera alert - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et the accident further limited pipeline capacity into california for a two - week period . during that time , the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions . as hydroelectric generation declined through the summer , the price strength extended into northern california . malin , which had been pricing near parity with the henry hub in the summer , began trading at a $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu premium to the henry hub in september . the summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter . the following factors are now driving this market : * continuing surges in gas demand . gas demand levels have remained high since early summer , driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output . demand levels for the third quarter in the us west averaged 10 . 7 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day , up from 8 . 7 bcf per day during the third quarter 1999 . persistently strong gas - fired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production , frustrating efforts to fill storage . this pressure will continue . the year - over - year demand increases from the power sector will be compounded , as evidenced in november , by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day . overall , cera expects nearly 1 . 6 bcf per day of increased demand in the west this winter , with the critical california and pacific northwest regions showing 1 . 2 bcf per day of increased demand . key power sector drivers , including the strong economy , colder weather , and lower hydroelectric generation , will continue to push gas - fired generation . * pipeline utilization nears capacity . strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels . flows from british columbia into the northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer , while flows from the rockies on northwest have remained at pipeline capacity . flows on pgt into kingsgate have remained at or near capacity , although approximately 300 mmcf per day of excess capacity exists on pgt into california at malin . likewise , flows out of the rockies on kern river pipeline have consistently remained at capacity . the only slack pipeline capacity remaining for west coast gas markets has been on southwest pipes . during the past few months , these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from canada early last decade . the high utilization of western pipeline capacity - reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the west this summer - leaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes . and that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks ( see figure 1 ) . given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand , flows on the el paso and transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from december through march than they have averaged through november . * deteriorating storage position . at the start of november california storage inventories held at 154 bcf , a full 32 bcf below the five - year average inventory level . the strong in - state withdrawals during november weakened that position to 128 bcf ; the deficit swelled to 62 bcf . inventories in california have never fallen below 60 bcf , so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than 700 mmcf per day . storage inventories in california are so low that utilities ' ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demand - sensitive price points is severely limited . if the cold weather blast anticipated for mid - december materializes , this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter ( see figure 2 ) . * short - term contracting . a significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market . a shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactions - in many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulation - has left the west much more exposed to spot market volatility . in other areas of the country , utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate and / or have forward purchased gas ( at previous and lower prices ) for at least some portion of their winter supplies . as a result , unlike in eastern markets , a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of california utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes . * no alternatives . a lack of fuel - switching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices . power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices . not surprisingly , gas prices pushed the cost of gas - fired generation beyond the federal energy regulatory commission ' s ( ferc ' s ) proposed price cap of $ 150 per megawatt - hour , setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit . a small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable . significantly , air emissions restrictions - already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this year - will make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial california market highly unlikely this winter . a recent meeting of the south coast air quality management district , which has jurisdiction over the los angeles area , concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits . market forces unite for price spikes during november the first cold weather - related demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets . a cold weather system in mid - november brought temperatures averaging 47 percent colder than normal - the temperatures actually averaged 14 percent colder than a normal january week - and provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the west coast . capacity constraints on moving gas into california that appeared during the summer extended north into the pacific northwest as heating loads climbed . this core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation . the high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages . gas demand in the us west during the last two weeks of november was boosted to approximately 15 . 5 bcf per day , driven by heating demand increases of 2 . 8 bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage - related demand increases of 1 . 0 bcf per day . these demand spikes caused buyers - already dependent on the spot market - to bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of november and into december . since demand outstripped supply , prices rose dramatically at all western price points , and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels . citygate prices surged beyond $ 40 . 00 per mmbtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $ 15 . 00 per mmbtu for december bidweek at topock . daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions . west coast to remain disconnected through the winter although the week of november 13 could prove to be the peak demand week in the west this winter , cera does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the west coast any time soon . storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities . generators , which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies , are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies . colder - than - normal weather would likely keep west coast prices in the $ 20 . 00 - $ 40 . 00 per mmbtu range . more normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu down into the $ 15 . 00 - $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu range . however , the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early january . this winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets , and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the west coast market . as heating loads diminish significantly in march and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue , premiums should retreat back into the $ 1 . 00 - $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu range . as hydroelectric generation begins to increase , the pressure could subside even further , but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring . the unique vulnerability of the pacific northwest the west coast price pressure is not limited to california . high demand in the pacific northwest ( and more indirectly in california ) will keep upward pressure on prices from sumas to stanfield . northwest pipeline capacity from the rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the pacific northwest . the combined california and pacific northwest demand pushed stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there . the only supply source for the load centers in southern british columbia and even more so in northern pacific northwest ( such as seattle ) are from westcoast at sumas . the westcoast mainline from the producing fields in northeast british columbia has also been operating at capacity . the same bidding forces felt in california have been evident at these western canadian price points , pushing sumas prices into the $ 20 s per mmbtu . these forces will persist , keeping sumas at a premium to aeco over the winter - and in much closer relationship to california prices . customer response : another log on the backlash bonfire with power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices , consumers ' bills from vancouver to san diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices . the gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter , warning regulators and customers alike . however , the price spikes in the west and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming . capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions , resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders . market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart ( no matter what their merits ) . some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected . as has occurred in the power markets , this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices , particularly in california . the likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated graphics . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 -

" all things that are happening to the margin , whether it be california , 9 - 11 ( the sept . 11 attacks ) , or enron , will tend to slow down changes that have gone down that path , " derrick said after addressing an energy department conference here on coal technology . derrick was optimistic about the future of deregulation . " where it already exists , it ' s working , and i think we ' ll stay the course , " he said . to boost customer choice , 23 states and the district columbia have deregulated retail electricity markets . deregulation breaks up utility monopolies , giving customers a choice of providers and driving down prices . electricity competition is set to begin in texas , illinois , michigan , and virginia next year . derrick said state deregulation efforts will pick up momentum if consumers demand more choice and lower prices . " people who ( live in a market that is deregulated ) , and move to a place where it doesn ' t exist , are going to say ' gee , why can ' t i have it here ' , " derrick said . " customers are going to start to demand choice , " he added . pepco is part of the pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland ( pjm ) power pool , which operates the electricity grid in the mid - atlantic region . pjm , which currently coordinates a pooled generating capacity of more than 59 , 000 megawatts , plans to expand generating capacity by 25 percent in the next few years to meet demand . pjm also operates a wholesale electricity market with more than 200 buyers , sellers and traders . california dealt the first blow to electricity deregulation last year , when state power prices soared , bankrupting pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric unit , and forcing rolling blackouts to some customers . experts have blamed the california power crisis on the state ' s ill - fated deregulation plan , which prohibited utilities from passing on wholesale price increases to consumers . the decline of enron may slow restructuring because uncertain customers will stick with existing power suppliers rather than seek new energy providers . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . lawmaker / andersen - 2 : co ' confident ' about quality 11 / 19 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 202 - 862 - 6692 ; judith . burns @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . some pension funds consider legal action against enron by christiane bird 11 / 19 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) dow jones newswires new york - - some pension funds with major stakes in enron corp . are considering taking legal action against the houston energy giant following its recent stock collapse and disclosures of possible conflicts of interest among management . other institutional investors are taking a more passive approach , waiting to see how developments unfold . among those pension funds looking into possible lawsuits are the $ 112 billion new york state common retirement fund and the five new york city pension funds , which handle a total of $ 85 billion in assets for the city ' s firefighters , police , teachers and other workers . the state fund holds about 2 . 1 million enron ( ene ) shares and the city funds hold about 2 . 9 million .

" until all of these issues are sorted out , the interests of shareholders are best served by retirement of all the current directors , " michael flaherman , chair of calpers ' investment committee , said in the statement . however , calpers has no comment regarding possible legal action against enron , spokesman brad pacheco said . calpers owns about three million shares of enron and also invests in dynegy . the $ 105 billion california state teachers retirement system , or calstrs , is " taking a keen interest , and reviewing our holdings and options " regarding enron , said a spokeswoman . the board has made no decisions yet , but plans to discuss the subject in a closed session at the next board meeting , she said . the $ 96 billion florida retirement system , which holds 9 . 7 million enron shares , is " still evaluating the situation , " spokeswoman lee baldwin said .

2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 2 - congressman urges probe of andersen on enron . by kevin drawbaugh 11 / 19 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , nov 19 ( reuters ) - a u . s . congressman has called for an investigation of big five accounting firm arthur andersen llp in connection with its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc . , according to a letter released on monday . turning up the heat under the conflict - of - interest issue among the world ' s largest bean - counters , rep . john dingell asked the public oversight board for " an oversight review or special investigation of arthur andersen llp , " said the letter made available to reuters . dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of arthur andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms , including deloitte & touche , and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978 . " the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , " wrote dingell , a michigan democrat , in the letter . " i request that pob ' s investigation or review include adequate , transparent and public disclosure of all significant issues identified , " dingell wrote . as accounting has consolidated into fewer and larger firms with more lines of business from auditing to consulting , it has come under increasing fire on the conflict - of - interest issue . the dingell letter is only the latest in a continuing barrage of criticism leveled in recent years at big five firms . arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of certain outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending . enron earlier this month said it planned to be bought out by rival dynegy inc . . critics have said arthur andersen should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to its unusual finances . a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged arthur andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it was collecting from enron while it was also being paid as auditor . andersen says confident in process responding to dingell , andersen spokesman david tabolt said accounting firms must report litigation involving allegations of audit failures within 30 days to a committee of the sec ' s practice section , which the public oversight board oversees . " under the profession ' s self - regulatory processes , which the pob oversees , the committee is responsible for conducting an inquiry to determine whether the matters that are the subject of litigation indicate systemic quality control problems that need to be addressed either by the firm involved or by the profession , " tabolt said . " we are confident that this process will confirm the quality of our auditing processes , " he said . after the sec said last month that it was investigating enron , the company appointed a special internal committee to look into the unusual partnership deals at the heart of the probe . deloitte & touche , also a big five accounting firm , was named to assist the committee in its inquiry , enron said . but , according to dingell , deloitte is conducting a triennial peer review of andersen under a system set up in the 1970 s to ensure quality accounting . the peer review process is also supervised by the public oversight board , based in connecticut . neither the board nor deloitte could be reached . dingell said deloitte ' s dual roles as peer reviewer of andersen and as internal investigator of its audit client enron raise further questions of potential conflicts of interest . " given the appearance of conflicts of interest , the public record to date regarding allegations of professional malpractice or worse by andersen in both the waste management fraud and the evolving enron corp . accounting debacle , as well as the considerable damage to investors , there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , " wrote dingell , ranking member of the house committee on energy and commerce . in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , a garbage hauling concern , in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron delays closing indian plant after creditors ' legal action 11 / 19 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd bombay ( afx ) - enron corp ' s indian subsidiary said it had to delay serving a final termination notice to close its power project in western maharashtra state after local creditors filed legal action . the dabhol power company ltd ( dpc ) was originally going to serve the notice to maharashtra state ' s electricity board ( mseb ) after today , when the six - month deadline for resolving a payment dispute ends , an enron official told agence france - presse . now , however , it has to wait until after dec 3 , because indian banks and financial institutions that have lent money to dabhol power recently filed a lawsuit to ensure they get their funds back . " the domestic lenders have gone to the court and secured a stay order against our final notice till their next nearing which is on december 3 , " an enron official said .

" the number of class members will be huge , " says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ? source : the economist . copyright ? 2000 dow jones another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity that lay said was in negotiations last week ; and the success of a planned $ 800 million sale of assets by year ' s end ) . the $ 1 . 75 billion loan is part of a $ 3 billion revolving facility , also led by jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb , that was drawn down in october to pay off about $ 1 . 8 billion in commercial paper obligations and calm the market ' s concerns about enron ' s liquidity . the facility also includes a $ 1 . 25 billion portion that matures in 2005 . " one of the big credit issues from a corporate standpoint is enron ' s ability to renew the 364 - day facility that matures in 2002 , " said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst at fitch . the lead banks declined to comment on the ongoing loan discussions , which include the already agreed to $ 1 billion facility that is secured by enron pipeline assets , and other bankers in the close - knit loan syndication community admitted to being in the dark . it is likely , though , that the discussions have included an attempt to address bankers ' concerns about the loan maturing in five months , pellecchia said . " i think that in conjunction with the new $ 1 billion loan , they are attempting to address the revolver , " pellecchia said . the $ 1 billion loan , hammered out in late october , was expected to be syndicated among a small , select group of lenders . incorporating the maturing revolver into the current solution would likely bring in a wider circle of banks , one banker said , noting that " just about everybody was in that [ existing ] deal . " jpm / citi must save enron however the financing unfolds , arrangers jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb ' s tight control of the deal reflects the banks ' urgency in aiding a major corporate client to which they have a broad range of business exposure . that exposure extends beyond corporate loans to credit derivatives and short - term loans financing the company ' s myriad energy trading - related transactions . " [ jp morgan and citi ] have the most to gain but also the most to lose with respect to enron , " said one rival banker , adding that the banks ' rapid response to enron ' s deteriorating situation reflected the importance of those relationships . " i was amazed how quickly that [ $ 1 billion ] deal came together , and how enron - which never did anything secured - pledged its most valuable [ pipeline ] assets . " the $ 1 billion loan is secured by enron ' s trans western and northern natural gas pipeline systems , the latter of which is also pledged to dynegy for its $ 1 . 5 billion investment . " from a risk standpoint , it ' s probably the best peace of enron paper that chase and citi have - it ' s the only secured stuff out there , " said one banker . but despite the impressive collateral , the $ 1 billion loan was priced attractively at 250 basis points over libor , he said . " i think it ' s a comment on how bad the news was . enron ' s going to have to put up one of its major jewels for a $ 1 billion credit at libor plus 250 . " in addition to playing major roles in financing enron ' s off - balance sheet ventures , such as the dahbol power project in india , jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb have also been major players in the company ' s complicated financing initiatives . for example , citibank / ssb runs enron ' s yosemite credit - linked note program and , along with jp morgan chase , is active in other enron - related credit derivative business . a recent research report by goldman sachs noted that the one - stop shop concept closely tied the banks to enron and has also made them crucial in these trying times . " the two banks most involved with enron in terms of magnitude of credit / derivatives exposure , citi and jp morgan , were also obviously involved in selling the company , with each acting as a financial advisor in the sale , " the report stated . " the banks were critical ( given enron ' s liquidity needs and the related high risk to further rating agency downgrades ) and likely influential to the outcome reached to sell the company as a means to sustain the operations of enron and protect all creditors involved . consequently , in a way , this is another win for the bank / broker model , " the report says . in a separate report , goldman ' s fixed income power analyst , robert rubin , said that despite enron ' s questionable business practices bringing it close to the brink , a merger that maintains its core energy market - making operations is preferable to leaving a vacuum in that arena . he added that despite concerns raised by the ratings agencies and other parties , goldman believes the merger will close . " the balance sheet of a combined company could be strong , if enron completes its asset sales , " fitch ' s pellecchia said . " but there are still a lot of moving pieces .

' s proposed buyout of ailing enron corp . by putting $ 2 . 5 billion of new equity in dynegy to support the deal . chevrontexaco , which currently owns approximately 26 % of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock , will invest $ 1 . 5 billion immediately . the $ 1 billion balance would be made at the closing of the dynegy - enron merger . " our relationship with dynegy has proven to be highly beneficial for both companies , and we are optimistic we will continue to see comparable or better performance in the future , " said david o ' reilly , chairman and ceo of chevrontexaco . chevron first took a stake in dynegy in 1996 . dynegy is one of the industry ' s largest marketers and traders of natural gas , power and coal , as well as a leading producer of electricity . dynegy midstream services is one of the largest marketers and producers of natural gas liquids . " we are also hopeful that the combination of dynegy and enron will restore market and credit confidence in this important energy sector , " o ' reilly continued . in october , the securities and exchange commission began investigating enron ' s relationship with two questionable partnerships once run by its former chief financial officer andrew fastow . in november , enron revealed that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in its financial statements , and the company would restate four years worth of filings the company ' s stock price plunged from a 52 - week peak of $ 84 . 87 to $ 7 two weeks ago . shell was reported at one time to be a potential buyer of enron . together , dynegy and enron have natural gas sales of approximately 40 billion cubic feet per day and 25 , 000 miles of gas pipelines . - carol cole copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron meltdown storage was chock - full , so much so that little could be injected because cavern pressures were too high . sure , there was a lot of weather hype about a cold winter coming , but that was only a forecast . that was meaningless even if it came true , because the winter would have to be 7 - 8 % colder than normal just to burn up the 375 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) surplus already in storage , to get next april ' s inventories in line with last april ' s levels . anybody could see that surplus was also due to get much bigger by the end of november because there were huge 70 - 90 bcf weekly withdrawals last year due to the fact that month was bitterly cold in 2000 . in face of all those bearish facts , which could have been willing to bid cash prices up at spot for most of october , then bid them up even higher during the last week , which was bid week for november ? we are talking about obligations that committed the buyers for baseload supply for the entire month of november - not just a spot price for a day or two of swing supply . no big storage arbitrage game , either no , the cash market strength couldn ' t be explained by the arbitrage game of buying cash gas cheap , injecting it into storage and then shorting the out months ' futures to lock in a margin . there wasn ' t much of a gap between the november screen index and cash prices . most cash deals went at index minus a few cents during october . true , there was a nice gap between cash and the december futures screen , but there was not much chance to profit by this . storage was so full that little volume could have been injected during october . so if someone says the price surge that month was all due to " the expected workings of supply and demand , " we would have to ask him what he was smoking . sunspots would have been a more likely explanation . lack of confidence in enron as a counterparty is a more likely explanation a better idea emerges after we note that spot prices continued high into november , in spite of continued record - breaking warmth . henry hub cash tags reached $ 3 . 24 on friday , nov . 2 . then that all reversed suddenly on nov . 7 - 9 , which was just when serious rumors that dynegy was going to buy enron and put it out of its misery began , and then became fact . by presstime last wednesday , nov . 14 - - a mere one week later - - the henry hub had collapsed all the way to $ 2 . 29 and was still falling like a stone - - getting back to where it should have been all october . can this be just a coincidence ? we think it likely that the reason prices were not that low in october is that with rumors of enron troubles circulating , the wholesale market had been given a flat tire by a fear of a potential lack of liquidity . there could have been a perceived need for somebody with a better credit rating to back up the enron traders who took the opposite side of one trade in four nationally . in fact , recent news reports say that after the first reports of enron ' s problems emerged in mid - october , there was a falloff in the willingness of commercial users of gas ( and electricity as well ) to buy fixed - price supply contracts with enron because the firm ' s corporate credit risk hampered its ability to hedge its obligations . " how comfortable would you feel signing a fixed - price deal with a company with no assets of its own to produce your gas or generate your power , and whose ability to obtain those supplies via futures or swaps was eroded because its credit was on the verge of being downgraded to junk ? " an energy banker asked . this could have favored the long side of the market in normal circumstances , consumers such as utilities could almost have stayed out of the november bid week cash market , backed as they were by huge storage and warm weather . instead they must have bought heavily , perhaps fearing that with enron sick there wouldn ' t be enough counterparty weight to take the other side and supply them later if they stayed short . the fear could have been that over the counter swaps to hedge later spot purchases might just not be available on enron online the way they usually are . other traders might not have been able to take up the slack , since they trade often with enron . commercial players might have perceived them as being infected with some of the same weakness . after the dynegy deal was announced , however , prices could have been freed to fall back to where they were at the end of september , with users now unafraid to play the short side because enron was back in business with a better credit rating . by nov . 14 , with cash prices more than $ 1 below where they were during bid week , enron spokesman eric thode said , " volumes on enron online have returned to the normal range . the 30 - day moving average has improved to a more normal 5 , 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $ 1 . 7 billion . " even allowing for some exaggeration by enron ' s pr man to instill market confidence , that points to a correlation of falling prices and a revived enron . they don ' t speak german at enron , do they ? if so , what happened to gas prices last month could have been the mirror image of the metallgesellschaft ag - induced crisis on the oil futures market in early 1994 . that crisis pushed oil prices down instead of shoving gas prices up . this german firm , a trader and user of oil , had used a very aggressive strategy to obtain its supplies of oil . in order to lock in a price for the coming year , the germans " stacked " all their contracts covering their oil needs for the coming year as long positions on the near month . they would go to delivery on just the portion they needed for the next four weeks , then would " roll " the rest of the contracts onto the next futures month . they did that by selling the remainder of the expiring month ' s contracts and using the money to buy the same number of the next month ' s contracts . but to be sure of being able to do that without losing their lederhosen , the germans had to be sure that the next month ' s contracts would be cheaper than the prompt month ones they had just sold . well , due to last minute purchases by consumers going to delivery , the prompt month usually is higher than the next one . so the germans thought they had a strategy that would guarantee them a profit every month when they flipped their futures stack , a nice kicker on top of having locked in the underlying cost of the oil they would use for the year . yeah , right . well , one month that didn ' t happen , mostly because other traders got wind of what the germans were doing and decided to hold their feet to the fire by bidding up the next month ( which is a variant of what happened to long term capital management four years later . ) so , losing another battle of the bulge , this time to nymex traders instead of to general patton , metallgesellschaft cratered . as a trustee unwound the train wreck of long futures , he went on a selling spree that kept the nymex price low for months . ngl price boxscore data from altrade ( tm ) ngl indexes mtd averages in italics mont belvieu tx eth pro norm iso pen + ngl bbl nov 8 - 14 , ' 01 22 . 53 35 . 45 41 . 44 39 . 36 45 . 34 $ 13 . 99 nov 1 - 7 , ' 01 23 . 85 35 . 91 41 . 24 40 . 38 45 . 5 $ 14 . 28 oct 25 - 31 , ' 01 24 . 63 39 . 22 43 . 74 43 . 15 # # # $ 15 . 30 oct 18 - 24 , ' 01 23 . 95 39 . 27 43 . 96 43 . 34 47 . 84 $ 15 . 07 oct ' 01 24 . 05 39 . 44 45 . 06 44 . 44 50 $ 15 . 34 sept ' 01 25 . 62 42 . 4 52 . 65 51 . 8 59 . 68 $ 17 . 19 3 rd qtr ' 01 26 . 55 41 . 12 49 . 94 49 . 7 56 . 31 $ 16 . 75 2 nd qtr ' 01 36 . 27 49 . 57 55 . 22 64 . 89 64 . 68 $ 20 . 50 3 rd qtr ' 00 39 59 . 39 66 . 99 66 . 35 75 . 29 $ 23 . 47 nov 9 - 15 , ' 00 43 . 46 61 . 35 73 . 24 72 . 02 82 . 94 $ 25 . 39 conway ks : group 140 nov 8 - 14 , ' 01 21 . 08 37 . 67 37 . 13 41 . 5 44 . 16 $ 13 . 78 nov 1 - 7 , ' 01 22 . 57 40 . 69 38 . 5 43 . 68 43 . 78 $ 14 . 48 oct 25 - 31 , ' 01 22 . 21 44 . 22 39 . 86 48 . 5 49 . 21 $ 15 . 41 oct 18 - 24 , ' 01 21 . 72 44 . 74 40 . 84 47 . 17 50 . 44 $ 15 . 50 oct ' 01 21 . 7 44 . 21 39 . 63 46 . 37 54 . 04 $ 15 . 59 sept ' 01 21 . 83 46 . 97 44 . 93 51 . 87 78 . 11 $ 18 . 00 3 rd qtr ' 01 23 . 86 45 . 33 44 . 72 52 . 77 74 . 4 $ 17 . 88 2 nd qtr ' 01 32 . 27 54 . 15 53 . 99 76 . 12 76 . 01 $ 21 . 44 3 rd qtr ' 00 37 . 11 63 . 91 65 . 8 67 . 48 78 . 9 $ 23 . 93 nov 9 - 15 , ' 00 42 . 26 62 . 63 73 . 27 74 . 8 83 $ 25 . 43 individual product prices in cents per gallon . ngl barrel : dollars per 42 gallons . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . u . s .

2	Subject: face and finger print technology piyiqpgarcbxxr wvaiqra acekey ( feky ) facial and fingerprint recognition products feb . 13 th targets terrorism prevention and corporate fraud markets facekey . corporation market information symbol - feky recent price : $ 0 . 40 key drivers life after 9 / 11 finds america living with evils far beyond our imagination one biometric company ( facekey corp ) appears to be on the forefront of making a difference . facekey corp . trading on the otc under the ticker symbol feky . headquartered in san antonio texas , this biometric company combines face and fingerprint recognition technology which can be used in both the public and private sectors . coo annette starkweather exclaims by effectively combining both fingerprint and facial recognition , facekey is targeting the two largest revenue producing areas in the biometrics industry today while establishing patented technology to forge the future of biometric applications . according to the international biometrics group ( ibg ) , an independent market research firm , the total biometrics market was $ 730 million in 2003 . biometrics is anticipated to grow to approximately $ 4 . 8 billion by 2008 . fingerprint technology represents $ 1 . 4 billion and facial recognition $ 802 million of that $ 4 . 8 billion . currently the biometric industry is in its early stages of growth but we believe government initiatives will act as a major catalyst towards global industry growth . for example on january 5 th of this year the u . s . - visitor and immigrant status indicator technology was implemented at 115 airports and 14 ship terminals , requiring u . s . customs officials to digitally photograph and fingerprint visa carrying foreign nationals data is compared against a government database of possible terrorists with criminal histories ( source : msnbc , roland jones 1 / 20 / 04 ) . the program received $ 330 million for the fiscal year 2004 . biometrics is also used in the battle against occupational fraud . based on 2004 report findings by the association of certified fraud examiners ( acfe ) , the typical organization loses 6 percent of its annual revenues to occupational fraud . if multiplied by the u . s . gdp , which in 2003 was just under $ 11 trillion , it would translate into $ 660 billion in annual fraud losses . this is why facekey through its innovative biometric technologies is focusing much of its core business on fraud . government initiatives are always plagued with delays due to slow or inconsistent standards of development , lengthy technology reviews and public comment . to offset that facekey has diversified into the private sector as well , proving that its management team has the ability to find other niche areas where its technology could be used to grow both bottom and top line numbers continually . in fact in a press release issued january 18 , 2004 , annette h . starkweather , facekey corp . coo goes on to say , ` ` on a recent trip to las vegas , we discovered that casinos represent a largely underdeveloped market that could benefit from facekey ' s biometric products . based on discussions we have had with casino personnel , our multiple face tracking software engine would greatly improve the speed and efficiency of current surveillance methods used by many las vegas casinos to screen their crowds for persons that could pose a security threat . . due to an emerging global market and facekey ' s ability to target both public and private sectors through there innovative facial and fingerprint recognition technologies we believe this company has the ability increase market share significantly . i think jp morgan ' s analyst paul coster says it best when he wrote in his september 2 nd 2004 research report we think biometrics looks like a rising tide that should lift all boats . facekey . corporation at a glance facekey ' s combination of face and fingerprint recognition technology comprises of 60 % of the entire biometrics market which is predicted to grow to $ 4 . 8 billion by 2008 facekey possesses a strong ip portfolio consisting of one issued patent and several patent pending . for additional detail on product information go to facekey ' s diversification into both public and private sectors increase market share potential facekey has funded operations to date with a negligible amount of debt recent news wed , feb 2 , 2005 facekey launches fingerprint based pc accesskey to eliminate passwords primezone media network mon , jan 31 , 2005 facekey to attend annual government technology conference in austin primezone media network thu , jan 27 , 2005 facekey introduces biometric time and attendance system to reduce employee fraud primezone media network tue , jan 25 , 2005 key executive discusses facekey ' s cutting -

( 100 % owned ) enron american del sur , s . a . is an enron corp . / enron transportation services entity no entity called enron singapore . . . . more than likely enron capital no enron wind uk , no enron wind india . . . . but regardless , they are all part of the ewc / erec family . global these entities all are a part of enron global exploration & production , inc . , which is owned by enron corp . , but one has indirect outside ownership . ep : enron oil & gas india ltd . , for instance , is owned by enron asst holdings , which is owned by enron finance partners , which is part of a complex ownership structure that includes one non - enron entity ( zephyrus investments , llc ) with a small interest . again , i hope this information is helpful . for the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track . let my group know if we can be of additional assistance . hardie angus h . davis vice president corporate secretary department enron corp . & subsidiaries / affiliates ( 713 ) 853 - 6941 hardie . davis @ enron . com [ davis , hardie ] - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kean , steven j . sent : tuesday , december 04 , 2001 3 : 01 pm to : davis , hardie subject : fw : non us locations per our conversation - - - - - original message - - - - - from : schultea , kathryn sent : tuesday , december 04 , 2001 11 : 30 am to : kean , steven j . subject : non us locations here you go . call with questions .

2	Subject: confidential business proposal mr . joseph yun china merchant bank . des bouex rd . branch , central hong kong , honk kong . j _ yun 46 @ yahoo . com . hk dear friend , i am mr . joseph yun , credit officer of the china merchant bank . i have a concealed business suggestion for you . before the u . s and iraqi war , our client gen . talfik kubu who was with the iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months , with a value of forty three million , six hundred thousand united state dollars only in my branch . upon maturity several notices was sent to him , even during the war . again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him . we later find out that the general and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home . after further investigation it was also discovered that gen . talfik kubu did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit . and he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank . so , forty three million , six hundred thousand united state dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it . what bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the funds . against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to gen . talfik kubu so that you will be able to receive his funds . what is to be done : i want you to know that i have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful . i have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to gen . talfik kubu , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your full names and address so that the attorney can commence his job . after you have been made the next of kin , the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you . there is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents . please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue . once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70 % for me , 25 % for you and 5 % for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation . should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication , and i will provide you with more details of this operation . your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated . kind regards , mr . joseph yun êõíèßã çáóáçãé http : / / www . almojahed . info

2	Subject: this was the one recommended to me finally ! i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex , even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really wants is an extra inch ! 3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it is really surprisingly comfortable and soft . i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original size . i was really surprised ! i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5 after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long ! the lengthening is permanent ! i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i forget ! take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your money back . every penny . no - one sends them back ! the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends as new cells grow ! check it out

( each time the actual rate changes during the term ) just think about this for the upcoming tw _ usgt deal and nng " - reliant deals . notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing , the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day - - - i believe this is ferc ' s way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals - they are punishing themselves as well , as each filing will require a notice etc - so every day they could need to issue an order . i feel we need to discuss with columbia , ingaa and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare . an alternative would be to require you to post on internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate , so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate . i ' m sending you guys a copy of the order .

( chairman kenneth lay says enron is cooperating with the sec inquiry . ) one partnership , run by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow , added $ 236 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2001 , boosting enron ' s $ 425 million in net income in that period . the partnership ' s contribution plunged to $ 5 million in the second quarter ended june 30 , but investors only found out aug . 14 - - when enron filed its quarterly 10 - q with the sec . oddly enough , that was the day chief executive jeffrey skilling unexpectedly resigned . expect class - action lawyers to go after the profits skilling and other insiders made by selling $ 660 million in stock when shares were flying high . ( they ' re down 78 % from august 2000 . ) since skilling left , enron has taken a $ 1 . 2 billion hit to shareholders ' equity to unwind partnerships . " they certainly misled the market as to the size of [ partnership losses ] , " says thomas shapiro , one of several lawyers filing shareholder suits against enron . who knows what will emerge from some of the other partnerships ? enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 31 11 : 56 ( new york ) enron shares rise , rebounding from nine - year low ( updatel ) ( adds analyst comment in sixth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares rose as much as 19 percent , one day after falling to their lowest level in more than nine years , amid speculation the company may be a takeover target . shares of the top energy trader rose $ 1 . 58 , or 14 percent , to $ 12 . 74 in midday trading of 19 . 9 million shares , compared with the three - month daily average of 10 . 4 million shares . earlier , the shares hit $ 13 . 25 . shares of houston - based enron have fallen 84 percent this year . they have lost more than half their value this month amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships headed by andrew fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer . fastow was ousted last week in an attempt to restore confidence in the stock . ` ` there are rumors out there that they are a potential takeover target , but i think it ' s very unlikely that anyone will buy them out at this point , ' ' said zach wagner , an analyst at edward jones & co . ` ` there are too many uncertainties . ' ' enron is more likely to get a large cash infusion from an investor , wagner said . he has a ` ` reduce ' ' rating on enron shares . he doesn ' t own the stock . the wall street journal today said general electric co .

' s ( ge ) ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka , brkb ) and royal dutch / shell group ( rd ) have been named as potential buyers for enron . ms . coale said the takeover speculation was " unwarranted " and has surfaced each time enron shares faltered . " it would be very unusual . . . for a company to be interested in a takeover ( of enron ) given the uncertainty of the sec inquiry . why add that uncertainty to your portfolio ? " she said . furthermore , ms . coale said , it might be difficult for a company such as shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business . commerzbank ' s mr . meade also discounted the takeover speculation . he likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial - service company . " you are buying a human - capital - based business . you have to make sure you ' re not going to loose all your people , " he said . " it ' s a trickier acquisition . " but not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible . roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock value funds , said shell and enron are " neighbors " , and shell has looked at enron " on and off . " still , he said that if there is a buyer for enron , the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging enron ' s leading market position . some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company ' s name appear among their holdings in their annual reports . despite the rise in enron shares wednesday , there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock . in addition to the pending sec inquiry and the lingering credit concerns , attention also is being paid to their effect on enron ' s trading business . while several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely , at least one , entergy corp . ( etr ) , is said to be trimming its exposure to enron . the new york mercantile exchange also plans to use enron ' s weakness to recapture part of the over - the - counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market . write to christina cheddar at christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron trades higher after heavy losses by lisa sanders , cbs . marketwatch . com last update : 1 : 27 pm et oct . 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked in wednesday trading after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron ( ene : news , chart , profile ) added 13 percent , or $ 1 . 46 , to $ 12 . 62 in recent dealings . volume was heavy at 25 million shares . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston , pointed out that the heavy losses enron sustained over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday . " mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron , " he said . " mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today . " a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . olson said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point . " however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase , " he said . art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers . " it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle . " on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business . " it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly , " smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a " look - back provision , " which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ( ge : news , chart , profile ) ge capital or royal dutch shell ( rd : news , chart , profile ) making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report . " ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this , " smith said . " and shell always keeps us guessing . " olson also included aig ( aig : news , chart , profile ) and citigroup ( c : news , chart , profile ) as potential acquirers . " enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture , " he said . smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive .

" what it ' s showing is that the economy , although it ' s slowing now , is slowing at a gradual pace as opposed to rapidly plunging off a cliff , " said john herrmann , chief economist at ideaglobal .

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

2	Subject: re : the stock to watch homeland security investments the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing our readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security happen with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position ourselves in such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security investments is here to help our readers do just that . with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble , inc . this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long terms . symbol : ( vnbl ) current price : 0 . 08 short term target price : 0 . 35 12 month target price : 1 . 20 * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * * * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors to transmit information about a person or object wirelessly . * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location technology . * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies and governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such technology has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials designated high risk were they to fall into the wrong hands . * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order to create high security space in locales where it is deemed necessary . locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea ports , mines , nuclear facilities , and more . * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has made vnbl a hot buy . news on vnbl malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in the oil gas and petrochemical industries . although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they can also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur , such as a well filling with water . as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid can also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level . vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against threat . preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u . s . industry and economy . the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock . information within this email contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be forward looking statements . forward looking statements are based on expectations , estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated . forward looking statements in this action may be identified through the use of words such as projects , foresee , expects , will , anticipates , estimates , believes , understands or that by statements indicating certain actions may , could , or might occur . as with many micro - cap stocks , today ' s company has additional risk factors worth noting . those factors include : a limited operating history , the company advancing cash to related parties and a shareholder on an unsecured basis : one vendor , a related party through a majority stockholder , supplies ninety - seven percent of the company ' s raw materials : reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business and numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital . these factors and others are more fully spelled out in the company ' s sec filings . we urge you to read the filings before you invest . the rocket stock report does not represent that the information contained in this message states all material facts or does not omit a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading . all information provided within this email pertaining to investing , stocks , securities must be understood as information provided and not investment advice . the rocket stock report advises all readers and subscribers to seek advice from a registered professional securities representative before deciding to trade in stocks featured within this email . none of the material within this report shall be construed as any kind of investment advice or solicitation . many of these companies are on the verge of bankruptcy . you can lose all your money by investing in this stock . the publisher of the rocket stock report is not a registered investment advisor . subscribers should not view information herein as legal , tax , accounting or investment advice . any reference to past performance ( s ) of companies are specially selected to be referenced based on the favorable performance of these companies . you would need perfect timing to achieve the results in the examples given . there can be no assurance of that happening . remember , as always , past performance is never indicative of future results and a thorough due diligence effort , including a review of a company ' s filings , should be completed prior to investing . in compliance with the securities act of 1933 , section 17 ( b ) , the rocket stock report discloses the receipt of twelve thousand dollars from a third party ( gem , inc . ) , not an officer , director or affiliate shareholder for the circulation of this report . gem , inc . has a position in the stock they will sell at any time without notice . be aware of an inherent conflict of interest resulting from such compensation due to the fact that this is a paid advertisement and we are conflicted . all factual information in this report was gathered from public sources , including but not limited to company websites , sec filings and company press releases . the rocket stock report believes this information to be reliable but can make no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness . use of the material within this email constitutes your acceptance of these terms .

2	Subject: re : progress steve , thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the code . regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points . 1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work and she does not have the necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help . it ' s not that the work is beneath her . 2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston . he effectively told them to go away and work on the " research projects " and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just tanya ' s issue , though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful . 3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code . the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens . credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail . vince from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : progress vince , i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc . . . . both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ? the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability . on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems . i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days ? also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e . seperating research domain problems from it problems . she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that studying documentation wasn ' t enough . about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon . ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and winston is also working on a draft research / it " working together " document , which will identify how the exchange of information takes place . tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research . i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely . i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday . in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution . regards steve

2	Subject: re : regrouping of enw budget discussions wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each . the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set . the schedule that we have been working with that wes provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting . if you had set aside two hours , that had not been communicated to us . there were only two one - hour meeting slots on that schedule . one for enw from 1 - 2 and one for research from 3 - 4 . i have a major conflict on friday - i committed months ago to attend a meeting that ken lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours . . only because beth perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday , i decided to " skip out " from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together . in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting , i orchestrated the time swap with vince kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 3 : 00 . i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for ken lay . maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us . i would appreciate your help on that , louise . scheduling issues aside , wes suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared . our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business . we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - ees or ea . that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs . we are prepared , however , with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes . i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw . if you would like to cover all of enw ' s budgets together , both for ees and ea , then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time ( maybe 3 hours ? ) . i will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11 : 00 today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us . we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction , but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects . our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our " scope of engagement " discussion . a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement . we will have a straw man for discussion on that . - - sally - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : wednesday , september 26 , 2001 8 : 23 am to : beck , sally cc : piper , greg ; pickering , mark ; colwell , wes ; killen , faith ; roper , kerry ; schoppe , tammie ; valdez , christina subject : re : regrouping of enw budget discussions i am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation . i had allocated two hours on friday to do this from lpm until 3 pm . are you not intending an all in cost ( per transaction ) of it and operations ?

" we welcome this request , " enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l . lay said monday . " we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . " investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down $ 5 . 40 to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . the transactions took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to houston - based enron ' s 2000 annual report . they resulted in a $ 16 million pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a $ 36 million loss in 2000 . enron officials would not provide details about the transactions or identify the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions . " enron entered into transactions with [ limited partnerships ] to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , " according to the section . enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an " informal inquiry . " " this is not an investigation , " he said . " we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us . " sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings . the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements , the company ' s board was fully informed of and approved them , and they were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron keeps analysts happy as investors flee : call of the day 2001 - 10 - 23 17 : 08 ( new york ) enron keeps analysts happy as investors flee : call of the day new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - over lunch in a conference room at boston ' s four seasons hotel last thursday , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay tried to convince analysts and investors that the company has no more surprises . with the analysts , he apparently succeeded . enron remains one of wall street ' s most highly rated stocks , even after the largest energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $ 1 . 2 billion in shareholder equity . lay wasn ' t so successful with investors , who have abandoned enron shares , slashing their value 42 percent in a week . ` ` you ' ve got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has no clothes , ' ' said richard gross of lehman brothers inc . , who today repeated his ` ` strong buy ' ' rating on enron . analysts at credit suisse first boston , goldman , sachs & co . and other firms have also kept their highest ratings on enron . gross still likes the look of enron ' s finery . ` ` the core franchise here is very valuable , ' ' he said , and the stock ' s decline more than reflects the ` ` worst case ' ' for the company . in boston and at similar meetings in houston and new york , lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships . he and other enron executives assured investors the company has no more surprises in store , according to greg phelps , who manages $ 1 . 1 billion at john hancock advisers inc . , and attended the boston session . the partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity funds , according to analysts and investors , and included investments that lost money . the securities and exchange commission has asked for more information about them , enron said yesterday . one hold , one sell while two analysts have cut their enron ratings after learning about the partnerships , they only dented the company ' s popularity on wall street . michael heim of a . g . edwards & sons inc . in st . louis lowered his rating to ` ` hold ' ' from ` ` buy ' ' on friday . he said he has been looking for discussion of the partnerships in enron ' s sec filings and is only seeing ` ` vague references ' ' that don ' t leave him with a ` ` good comfort level . ' ' with heim ' s rating change , enron went from being the second most highly rated stock in the standard & poor ' s 500 index to the 10 th , according to thomson financial / first call . today , zach wagner at edward jones & co . in st . louis cut enron to ` ` reduce ' ' from ` ` accumulate . ' ' ratings by edward jones , which caters to individual investors rather than institutions , aren ' t tracked by first call . first call translates analyst ratings into numbers , with ` ` strong buy ' ' a one , ` ` buy ' ' a two , and so on , then averages the ratings to rank a company ' s wall street popularity . the most highly rated stock is tyco international ltd . , which has fallen 12 percent this year . enron shares fell 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 today . remaining skeptical however highly brokerage analysts rate the stock , ` ` i have to remain skeptical , ' ' said barry borak , energy analyst at david l . babson & co . , which manages $ 60 billion in cambridge , massachusetts . ` ` there ' s been a huge loss of management credibility at enron , ' ' borak said , because of the partnerships and the unexpected departure in august of jeffrey skilling , who had held the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir apparent to lay . ` ` nobody i ' ve talked to thinks ( skilling ' s departure ) is for personal reasons , ' ' borak said . skilling helped transform enron from a gas pipeline company into the biggest energy trading company . enron also owns power plants in deregulated markets . borak said babson doesn ' t own enron shares and won ' t be a buyer ` ` until i can get better , more thorough information about what else might pop up in the future . ' ' borak and other investors said enron has a reputation for not providing enough information about its businesses , and they said this makes the positive view of the company on wall street more difficult to understand . after skilling resigned , lay said the company would be more open about its businesses . a bullet point in his talk in boston was ` ` increased transparency of financial and operating results , ' ' according to a handout provided at the boston meeting . amazed , dismayed prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale wrote in a note to clients last week that she was ` ` amazed at the willingness of enron ' s management to break out earnings and expenses to the degree that it disclosed in the third quarter . ' ' coale also wrote that she was ` ` dismayed by the apparent ` disguise ' of the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity hit that was not disclosed in ( enron ' s ) press release and was briefly mentioned in the earnings conference call . ' ' coale kept her rating on enron at ` ` buy . ' ' phelps at john hancock said that his ` ` cynical side ' ' believes that investment banking business has helped keep wall street recommending enron stock . ` ` they provide some good underwriting business , ' ' he said . credit suisse first boston managed a secondary sale of 12 million enron shares in 1999 , with lehman brothers acting as co - manager . credit suisse has also managed bond sales for enron this year . enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 23 16 : 38 ( new york ) enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel ) ( updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph . ) new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the biggest energy trader , has asked citigroup inc . to arrange a $ 750 million loan , ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from money markets , say people familiar with the matter . enron ' s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company said the securities and exchange commission was investigating its finances . the company depends on a $ 3 billion commercial paper , or short - term debt , program to finance day - to - day operations . moody ' s investors service last week placed all $ 13 billion of the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade . any drop in the rating may cut off enron from the commercial paper market , raising the costs of short - term debt . ` ` we understand that our credit rating is critical to both the capital markets and our counterparties , ' ' enron ' s chief financial officer andrew fastow said on a conference call today . he said enron has $ 3 . 5 billion available on bank credit lines , giving it enough cash to operate normally . dan noonan , a spokesman for citigroup ' s citibank na unit , declined to comment . mark palmer , a spokesman for enron , also wouldn ' t comment . shares of enron , based in houston , fell 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 . they have fallen 76 percent this year . complex financing an investor sued enron last week , saying dealings with two partnerships run by fastow , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , cost the company $ 35 million . the suit also calls fastow ' s leadership of the partnerships , set up to remove debt from enron ' s books , a conflict of interest . enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in some partnerships run by fastow , said chief executive officer ken lay on the conference call with investors today . the number of shares differs from a wall street journal report on thursday that said enron had bought back 55 million shares . the buyback reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion , the journal said . the company set up the partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy enron assets such as power plants . the partnerships allow enron to take debt off its books , letting it borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading , enron said . enron trades electricity , natural gas , oil , coal and other commodities . ` ` ` they have complex off - balance sheet financing , ' ' said commerzbank analyst andre mead . ` ` it ' s difficult to ascertain the full impact on shareholders . ' ' the sec has asked enron about partnerships and affiliated companies headed by fastow . the company has at least $ 3 billion in such ` ` off - the - books ' ' financing in affiliated companies , ray niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to investors . depends on asset sales one partnership , whitewing management , owns 250 , 000 preferred shares that enron may have to convert to common stock . whitewing partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if enron common stock falls below a certain price or if enron ' s credit rating drops under investment grade . whitewing and other enron partnerships and trusts include company executives as officers and directors , according to records from the texas secretary of state . ` ` over the life of these trust structures , enron has in fact issued a sizable amount of equity , ' ' enron treasurer ben gilsan said . most of that was shares issued to enron executives as part of a deferred compensation plan , gilsan said . the whitewing partnership was financed with $ 1 . 4 billion in bonds sold last year . the partnership used some of the proceeds to buy enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling them , officials said on the conference call . other company partnerships operate with the same strategy . ` ` some investors are worried the asset sales won ' t cover the full amount ( borrowed ) , and enron will have to furnish support to the detriment of shareholders , ' ' said commerzbank analyst meade . commercial paper rates enron was paying 3 . 15 percent to issue commercial paper until oct . 31 , which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies with the same ` ` a 2 / p 2 ' ' short - term credit ratings that are not on credit watch . enron ' s short - term debt is not on review for a possible downgrade . based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long - term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above investment grade . fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s rate the company ' s debt at investment grade . enron has previously turned to citigroup for finance and advice . in 1999 , citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit advised the company on its $ 1 . 45 billion acquisition of three natural gas - fired power plants from cogen technologies inc . citibank , along with j . p . morgan chase asian , middle eastern , european , african , as well as american - born . they are young , mostly under 35 , and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry - the guys wear khakis , polo shirts , and banana republic button - downs . almost preposterously fit , they move through the building intently , like winners . enron is nothing if not energetic : a big brother - size tv screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators , while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage . a sculpture of the corporate symbol , an e tipped at a jaunty angle , radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis ; a starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated . multicolored , inspirational flags hang from the ceiling , congratulating enron on its diversity and its values ; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares enron ' s simple if grandiose goal : " from the world ' s leading energy company to . . . the world ' s leading company ! " for a while , that future seemed guaranteed , as enron transformed itself from a stodgy , troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000 . it was a wall street darling , with a stock price that increased 1 , 700 percent in that sixteen - year period , with revenues that increased from $ 40 billion to $ 100 billion . " the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy , " notes a 2001 report from global change associates , a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business . this enron was largely the creation of jeff skilling , a visionary determined to transform american business . hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then - ceo ken lay , skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground , hauling it in pipelines , and then selling it to refineries and other customers . instead , it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms , from natural gas to electricity , from wind to water . if you had a risky drilling venture , enron would fund it for a piece of the action . if you wanted your megacorporation ' s energy needs analyzed and streamlined , enron could do the job . if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs , enron was there to build and build . basically , if an idea was new and potentially - and fantastically - lucrative , enron wanted the first crack . and with each success , enron became ever more certain of its destiny . the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high - tech world , and in february of this year , skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer . enron , says skilling , " was a great marriage of the risk - taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk - taking mentality of the financial markets . " the enron story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century . like the high - tech companies it emulated , enron was going to reinvent the american business model and , in turn , the american economy . maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a culture that was based on absolutes : not just the old versus the new , but the best versus the mediocre , the risk takers versus the complacent - those who could see the future versus those who could not . the key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital . with the best and the brightest , a company couldn ' t possibly go wrong . or could it ? today enron ' s stock trades at around $ 35 , down from a high of $ 80 in january . the press cast enron as the archvillain of california ' s energy crisis last spring , and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market . a long - troubled power plant project in india threatened the company ' s global ambitions . telecommunications , in which enron was heavily invested , imploded . wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices . some of the change in enron ' s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business . but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame . enron , jeff skilling says , had " a totally different way of thinking about business - we got it . " at enron , in fact , you either " got it " or you were gone - it was as simple as black and white . it is not coincidental , then , that the color scheme of skilling ' s river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed . here , the living room ' s white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors . black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets . billowy sofas set off the jet - black baby grand . in the entry , white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold , white marble . there is only one off - color note : after almost twenty years , jeff skilling is no longer associated with enron , having resigned abruptly after just six months as ceo . once , skilling was hailed as the next jack welch ( general electric ' s masterful ceo ) , as one of worth magazine ' s best ceo ' s in america ( anointed in 2001 ) , and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which , a friend told businessweek , " someone could actually get killed . " today , he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning . " i had no idea what i ' d let go of , " skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling enron . from a black chair in the white library , across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons , skilling clarifies . the demands of working 24 - 7 for enron caused him to ignore his personal finances . divorced , he lived in a 2 , 200 - square - foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher . he almost missed his brother ' s wedding . " learning a foreign language - i never learned a foreign language ! " he exclaims . he never once took his youngest son to school . " i ' m interested in the kids . you don ' t do kids in fifteen - minute scheduling . " travel : " you can ' t go to africa for a week and get anything out of it ! " skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities , then he stops and sighs . " i ' m not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a ceo ' s job , " he says , finally . then his eyes lock on mine , and his voice , which had softened , regains its pragmatic edge . " it would have been easy to stay , " he says . " but that would not have been good for me . " he ' s a smallish , ruddy - faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight , handsome in the way of corporate titans , with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze . but the impatience skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull - witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation " bizarre " and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time . his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button - down , and his matching blue eyes look put upon . " i ' m surprised , " he says , " that people have so much trouble understanding this . " people who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldn ' t help but notice a funny and , for its time , novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the enron building . from nine to five and before and after , you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke . they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry , puffing like mad . they always looked hurried and furtive , even ashamed . whatever people knew about enron in those days ( and most people didn ' t know much ) , it was often associated with that scene : enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in houston , and there couldn ' t have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past . what macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation ? but this company was a child of another time , that period in the mid - eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business . federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady , secure industry , in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served , into a volatile free - for - all . the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business . so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company , houston natural gas ( hng ) found itself under attack from coastal corporation , oscar wyatt ' s less than gentlemanly firm . hng was then run by lay , a sturdy , taciturn former economics professor and transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy . ( his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war . ) lay , who was from missouri and never succumbed - at least outwardly - to texas brashness , had done well enough : thanks to canny expansions , hng ' s pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of texas . hng fended off coastal , but to protect the company from other takeover attempts , lay nimbly engineered the sale of hng in 1985 to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called internorth , one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time . then , a funny thing happened : hng started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come - a lot like coastal . what the nebraskans blithely labeled " the purchase " was being called " the merger " back in houston , and before long , following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston , the company ' s center of gravity started shifting toward texas , and shortly after that , ken lay was running a new company called enron . " over time it became clear that lay had a better vision of the future , " says one person associated with enron at that time . " he never fought change . he embraced change . " lay had won , but what exactly did that mean ? enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt , and thanks to deregulation , no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines . without new ideas - for that matter , a whole new business plan - the company could be finished before it really even got started . like many people who teamed up with enron in the eighties , jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest , and he was self - made - at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start - up tv station in aurora , illinois . ( his mother would drop him off there every day after school . ) " i liked being successful when i was working , and i was smart , " he told businessweek earlier this year . but unlike many of his enron colleagues , skilling wasn ' t deliberate and soft - spoken and happy to go home at five o ' clock ; he was anxious and excitable , and nothing , but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call " intellectual capital . " he loved being smart , and he loved being surrounded by smart people . he graduated from southern methodist university , went into banking - assets and liability management - and took on harvard business school , where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class . then skilling took the next step on what was then the new , souped - up path to american success : he joined manhattan ' s mckinsey and company as a business consultant , and that is where ken lay found him in 1985 . it is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless , and his choice of skilling probably saved the company . skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked . while everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry , he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses . and so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by , skilling came up with what he called the gas bank , which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers . enron would not be a broker but a banker . it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved . and enron would make money on transactions , much like an investment bank would . skilling worked up some numbers and found them " absolutely compelling . " then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 enron executives . he had a one - page presentation . " almost to a person , " skilling says , " they thought it was stupid . " almost . after skilling left the meeting dejected , he walked ken lay to an elevator and apologized . lay listened and then said , " let ' s go . " the gas bank was not an overnight success . for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat , sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him . in fact , he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life : " i believed this whole world would be different , a huge breakthrough " is the way skilling puts it today , and even if he is typically immodest , he was right . fairly soon after launching , the company sold $ 800 million worth of gas in a week . true to skilling ' s character , success turned out to be a matter of old versus new : he says the joke around enron was that if a company ' s ceo was under fifty , " we were in . " and he was in too : in 1990 skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation , a new division created just for him . in 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $ 11 million in profit . after that , says skilling , " we never looked back . " skilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn ' t work unless it had a trading component . myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go . but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas , enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it . the company had the best contacts , the best intelligence , and the best access to supplies . that , in turn , attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play . with so many customers in its pocket , enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit - enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go , as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans , but with startling accuracy , thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined . this change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made : he created , within enron , a new culture to match its new trading business . the idea was to build a " knowledge - based business , " which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by enron ' s employees from the old hng days . most were deliberate , cautious , responsible , somewhat defensive people , most of them men , of course - the kind of people you ' d expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government . but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era : that included anyone who wanted to make money - lots of money - for themselves and for the company . " enron was going to create a niche for itself or die , " one former executive explains . " the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out , because if they had narrow views about other things , they had narrow views about the market . " skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people . he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard , stanford , and maybe , rice . and because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company , he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks , like merrill lynch or credit suisse first boston . in addition to being smart , enron people were also supposed to be " aggressive . " you were right for enron if you didn ' t want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization . you could see what he was looking for on " super saturdays " at the houston headquarters : eight fifty - minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between - the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day . they were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts , their problem - solving ability , their passion for hard work , and what at enron was called " a sense of urgency . " people who scored less than 2 . 5 were scratched . the shrewdest candidates knew how to work enron before they were even hired : these were the types that automatically turned down the company ' s first offer , knowing enron would come back with more . the starting salary was around $ 80 , 000 . maybe it wasn ' t a fortune - yet - but the signing bonus , about $ 20 , 000 , was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown . ( enron people didn ' t live in far - flung suburbs . suburbs were uncool and too far from the office . ) for the lucky winners , enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted - and - talented program . new associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals , and there were rotations at enron offices around the globe . the hours were long , but every possible need was taken care of . a company concierge handled all the things important people couldn ' t be bothered with : picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions , shining shoes , cleaning the house , planning a vacation . of course , a lot of people who worked for enron never got to take vacations - they were too busy making money - but they could use the company gym and the company ' s personal trainers . if they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking , they could join enron ' s wellness program . massages were offered six days a week , from seven in the morning until ten at night . " they were so cutting edge , " rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time . " they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going . " skilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms - analysts , associates , directors , and managing directors - but everyone knew that those titles didn ' t really matter . money did . instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses , enron offered competitive salaries and merit - based bonuses - with no cap . " if you really worked hard and delivered results , you could make a lot of money , " says ken rice , who stayed with enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company ' s faltering broadband division . or , as the saying goes , you got to eat what you killed . gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $ 1 million bonus . and the more you produced , the closer you got to jeff : real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia , land cruiser racing in australia , or off - road motorcycling in a re - creation of the baja 1 , 000 race , ending at a spectacular mexican villa . " every time he ' d speak , i ' d believe everything he ' d say , " one loyalist says . and why not ? by 1995 enron had become north america ' s largest natural - gas merchant , controlling 20 percent of the market . but at a company where the buzzword was " aggressive , " that was no place to stop : skilling and lay believed the gas bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business . firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers ( and untold profits for enron ) , they began barnstorming the country , pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents ( who , with their multimillion - dollar salaries and monopoly service areas , had little incentive to change ) and energy regulators ( who were somewhat more receptive , thanks in part to enron ' s generous lobbying efforts ) . but the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling . in 1997 ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company . by then , the division known as enron capital and trade resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . the division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees , and revenues from $ 2 billion to $ 7 billion . " mr . skilling ' s experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track , " the new york times noted . everyone would certainly have thought so : enron and skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another . " firing up an idea machine ; enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within , " sang the new york times in 1999 . " in the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies , enron corp is that gate - crashing elvis , " crowed fortune in 2000 . wall street was demanding tech - size growth on a tech timetable , and enron , in 2000 , obliged with second quarter earnings of $ 289 million , up 30 percent from the previous year . that year the company seemed to discover a market a minute : under skilling , enron was trading coal , paper , steel , and even weather . no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client . people drank more in warm weather than cold , so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn ? but most exciting to the financial world was enron ' s entry into high - tech communications . because of the company ' s marketing dominance , enrononline became another overnight success , handling $ 335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000 . enron , as usual , made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price . then there was the broadband business : to enron , trading excess capacity in large , high - speed fiber - optic networks ( empty lanes on the fabled information highway ) wasn ' t that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines . so enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth . soon after , it also announced a twenty - year deal with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes . enron looked like a company that couldn ' t lose . " its strategy of building businesses , shedding hard assets , and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market , " businessweek insisted . there was , however , another reason enron did so well in such a short time : the company ' s hard - nosed approach toward its customers . the old notion of customer service was based on the long haul - you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them . but enron had new markets and new ideas - customers had to come to it . over time , the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them " counterparties . " skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable : gains were maximized by creating , owning , and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated . so if you wanted to launch a high - risk venture quickly - such as zilkha energy ' s new high - tech approach to drilling for oil - you got your financing from enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project , if it ever would . but because enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them , enron could set the terms of its deals , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all . while many businesses used what was known in the industry as " mark - to - market accounting , " for instance , enron used it on an unprecedented scale . the company priced their deals at current market value - but it was always enron ' s idea of the market value ; companies that balked at their pricing didn ' t get deals . and while old - fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years , enron took most of its profit up - front . however many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years , they went on the books in the current year . if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called " subjective accounting , " investors didn ' t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in . as the market fluctuated and the landscape changed , the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren ' t going to be high enough . " enron is known for leaving people at the altar , " says one former employee . winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to enron ' s attitude toward charity . when a fundraiser for the houston read commission , a literacy group , called on enron for a contribution , it was suggested that he start raising money for enron ' s competing literacy charity : " even the person who was supposed to give money away for enron was supposed to make money for enron , " he says . as enron became more and more successful , the culture skilling had created took on a dark side : the competition turned inward . as one member of the enron family put it , " it became a company full of mercenaries . " the change started at the bottom . as enron ' s domination of the energy market grew , most of the recruiting frills fell away . new associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded . global change ' s enron spies reported overhearing orders like " i need a smart person - go buy me one " or " buy me an intelligent slave , quick . " enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday , but now the workaholism bordered on self - parody : a random acts of kindness program lasted only a few months . it was too disruptive . people couldn ' t get their work done . and , of course , enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension . the performance review committee , which had initially been installed by skilling in the capital group , became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country . employees were rated on a scale of one to five , and those with fives were usually gone within six months . ( the prc ' s nickname quickly became " rank and yank . " ) it was a point of pride that skilling ' s division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year . as one skilling associate put it , " jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store . " skilling ' s approach to business - get in and get out - had become enron ' s attitude toward its workers . in time , it would become many workers ' attitude toward the company . teamwork , never that valuable in a trading culture , went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus . if protocol required an enron higher - up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world , he might help - or he might not , depending on whether another , potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere . everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed : " they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future , " says one former employee . anyone who couldn ' t close deals within a quarter was punished with bad prc scores , as were the higher - ups who had backed them . past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in prc meetings that the phrase " no old tapes " became an enron clich ? . " people went from being geniuses to idiots overnight , " says one former enron executive . in such a hothouse , paranoia flowered . new contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company . e - mail was monitored . a former executive routinely carried two laptops , one for the company and one for himself . people may have been rich at enron , but they weren ' t necessarily happy . one recruiter described the culture this way : " they roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death . " before jeff skilling could transform enron from the world ' s leading energy company into the world ' s leading company , he had to make one more change : just as he had done ten years before , skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order . where enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines , it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets . pipelines , power plants - they may have been enron ' s pride , but skilling wanted them gone . expensive , long - term building projects had no place when wall street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital , and skilling knew it . " it wasn ' t the time for long - term approaches , " an enron executive says of wall street ' s mood . " it was the technology era . " to rid enron of the last vestiges of its past , skilling had to take on rebecca mark , long considered his rival for the ceo ' s job . mark was for many years the poster child for the enron way : young , attractive , aggressive - her nickname was mark the shark - she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba . mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international , the asset - heavy side of the company where she developed $ 20 billion worth of gas and power plants , which accounted for 40 percent of enron ' s profits in 1998 . for this she reaped breathtaking compensation - one enron executive estimated $ 10 million - and adoring press clips , including two appearances on fortune ' s list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate america . but then mark ran into trouble with a gas - fired power plant in dabhol , india , one of the largest ever constructed . she had played the game the enron way : taking enron into a new market , she had finagled low import taxes ( 20 percent instead of the usual 53 ) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government . but the time and expense needed to make india and other enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with enron ' s goals , and skilling ' s impatience with mark grew . forcing mark out , however , was no easy matter . key executives left , divisions were dismantled , but she remained . the truth was enron didn ' t mind firing lower - level employees , but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive , relentless people it tended to promote . the company preferred humiliation - keeping a director in his cubicle , say , but failing to include him in the glamour deals , or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title . ( one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school , gratis . ) a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public - relations disaster . so lay and skilling did something classically enronian : they gave mark her own company . despite skilling ' s contempt for asset - heavy businesses , enron spent more than $ 2 billion to buy a run - of - the - mill british water utility that could serve as enron ' s entry into the emerging world of water privatization . mark was put in charge of making enron , yes , the world ' s greatest water company . azurix , as the new business was called , looked like another sure thing : its ipo in 1999 raised $ 695 million . but mark had to succeed on enron ' s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities . water is not like gas or electricity - owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up , even for lots of money . the company stumbled , layoffs commenced , and confidence evaporated . by august 2000 the stock price , which had started out at $ 19 , had fallen to $ 5 . mark ' s resignation followed , and azurix , much diminished , was folded into enron . " i think it ' s best for rebecca to start afresh , " lay , who had been a mentor to mark , told the wall street journal . or as one critic put it , " they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business . " as 2000 drew to a close , skilling was in total command . in december ken lay announced the inevitable : " the best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well , " he told the press . " enron is doing extremely well now . " in february 2001 jeff skilling took over the ceo ' s job . almost immediately the trouble started . enron ' s domination of the electric - power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle . both pbs ' s frontline and the new york times took on enron , portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in washington ( lay and enron ' s political action committee are the top contributors to george w . bush ) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity . skilling and lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market , while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company ' s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in california , as both tried to buy power online . the times reported that lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation . the bad press was , to say the least , ironic : just as the media was pounding enron for its omnipotence , wall street was discovering its weaknesses . by late march the stock price had slid to $ 50 a share from $ 80 in january . within enron , the asset - based divisions took the rap for the decline . ( the india plant continued to be enormously costly , at least in part because of constant turnover within enron ' s management team . ) but the california situation was more visible and therefore more damaging , despite enron ' s claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had . " for three months gray davis did a very good job of blaming us , " says mark palmer , a vice president for corporate communications . " we were a texas company . there was a texan in the white house . california was a state that didn ' t put him in office , and his biggest contributor was a texas energy company . performance is going to take care of our stock price . the truth will take care of gray davis . " ( california utilities still owe enron $ 500 million , another reason stockholders might be panicky . ) but more problematic than the crisis itself was skilling ' s all too apparent lack of contrition . facing down his critics , he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic . ( " at least the titanic went down with its lights on . " ) but the biggest problem was enron ' s telecommunications division , which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price . investors believed that enron could revolutionize high - speed communications , just as it had revolutionized gas and power . enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber - optic cable would grow from $ 155 billion in 2001 to $ 383 billion by 2004 - but then the tech bubble burst . so too did the much - hyped movies - on - demand deal with blockbuster . for the first time in its confoundingly successful life , enron had nothing new to take to market . like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds , enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street . skilling launched a campaign to keep enron ' s most important cheerleaders , the stock analysts , in the tent , but he wasn ' t cut out to be a supplicant . during the reporting of first quarter profits , he called an analyst who challenged enron ' s financial reporting an " asshole . " when the company reported hefty second quarter profits , many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets . ignoring the growing chorus critical of enron ' s accounting , skilling promised , as he always had , that innovations were just around the corner . " there wasn ' t any positive news , " carol coale , of prudential financial , says now . " basically , he talked me out of a downgrade . " the business press , so generous in the past , turned surly . fortune had asked in march whether enron was overpriced . ( " start with a pretty straightforward question : how exactly does enron make its money ? " ) the routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale . ( skilling had sold $ 33 million worth , ken lay and ken rice close to four times that amount . ) then the wall street journal reported on a fund run by the cfo that had been a source of strife within the company . ( it was essentially risk management against enron ' s possible failures . ) every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price : by late august it had fallen below $ 40 . enron , so institutionally unforgiving , finally got a taste of its own medicine . " when wall street is in love with a stock , they ' re forgiving of something like accounting , " says carol coale . " when a company falls out of favor , all these issues carry more weight . " this fact was not lost on people inside the company , who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience . those who had looked the other way as the most powerful enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways . " it just created an attitude , " one executive still at enron says . " if senior people are doing that , why are we held to a higher standard ? there was a real culture of ' we ' re above everyone else . ' " loyalty had never been prized at enron , so there was no reason to expect it now . an old - fashioned , slow - moving company like exxon could demand hardship duty in baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road . " but , " as one houston oilman explains , " if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn ' t have loyalty and has money , then you have a corporation that ' s better suited for good times than bad . " as it turned out , that description applied to jeff skilling too . as the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend , he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration . then , after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in england , he had an epiphany : life was short ; for him , enron was over . ever stoic , ken lay returned to the ceo ' s office , named a new president , arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors , and promised a kinder , gentler enron in the future . trading anything and everything was out . the company , lay says , will still innovate but " innovate much closer to our core . " as for the culture : " things like the performance review committee , i think we could have applied better . by trying to categorize people into so many different categories , you ended up creating a morale problem . " that skilling ' s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence . despite skilling ' s lengthy tenure with enron , he ' d always been contemptuous of the long haul ; he ' d always believed in cutting losses and moving on . but now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble , it was different . " even jeff ' s biggest detractors wouldn ' t have wanted him to walk out the door , " one loyalist admits . but on the day we meet , skilling is looking forward , not back . " look , " he says with finality , " ninety percent of my net worth is in enron . were my interests aligned with the shareholders ? absolutely . " free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures , he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas . his eyes flash as he talks about new technologies . " the first wave never gets it right , " he says . " the stand - alone dot - coms didn ' t work , but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world . " houston , he promises , will become the world ' s center of commodity trading , and he intends to be a part of it . in fact , he is already shopping for office space . " this is the second wave , and enron ' s got it , " he says , almost breathless . " there are thousands of people running around the streets of houston that get it . " enron fails to smooth things over by peter eavis senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 23 / 2001 01 : 07 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) held a special conference call tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock . but worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the ceo publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off - balance sheet transaction . the transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that enron entered into with a partnership called ljm 2 , which was led by enron ' s finance chief andrew fastow . terminating this arrangement led to a $ 1 . 2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter . monday , enron stock plunged 20 % after the company said the securities and exchange commission is probing " related party transactions . " executives declined to respond to questions about fastow ' s role in the ljm 2 partnership on the tuesday call . another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction . the company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter , due to the termination of the ljm 2 financing . but ceo ken lay said the company wouldn ' t be increasing its earnings guidance of $ 1 . 80 a share for 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for 2002 . when a share count drops , earnings per share should normally increase , assuming the earnings number stays constant . the 60 million shares are equivalent to about 6 . 5 % of the company ' s diluted total in the third quarter . as a result , enron should have raised its per - share profits forecast by about that much , assuming constant earnings . when asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing , ceo lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for this year . he then affirmed the 2002 number . now , to be fair , enron may not be forecasting lower earnings . the planned reduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a level in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected . notably , the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million , meaning a fourth - quarter reduction might not change matters that much . alternatively , enron may beat fourth - quarter estimates by 6 . 5 % ; perhaps the company has simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage , given uncertainties in the economy . in any case , more clarity on this matter is clearly needed . calls to enron weren ' t immediately returned . the stock edged up 2 % tuesday after falling nearly 40 % since last week amid worries about complex off - balance sheet deals . the call , arranged after enron ' s monday plunge , contained a lot of queries about two trusts , called marlin ii and whitewing , against which enron borrowed some $ 3 . 4 billion . lay became testy after questioning by richard grubman of boston - based hedge fund highfields capital management . grubman , who was called an " a - - hole " by enron ' s former ceo jeff skilling on an april conference call , was trying to find out the value of water assets held by marlin ii . the optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to sell the water assets . grubman ' s line of questioning implied that the marlin assets were worth only about $ 100 million , meaning enron would have to find about $ 900 million to pay off the marlin ii - related debt . grubman arrived at $ 100 million after factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third - quarter writedown to water assets , some of which are included in marlin ii . lay disputed the $ 100 million number . at one point , he accused grubman of driving enron ' s stock down and monopolizing the tuesday conference call . in the middle of grubman ' s comments , lay told the call operator to go to the next caller . grubman didn ' t immediately return a call seeking comment . if enron has to find $ 900 million , this can be done by issuing stock or raising cash on its balance sheet . if the latter route is taken , enron says it ' s likely to use asset sales to generate the cash . enron executives said liquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $ 3 . 35 billion in available credit lines . but if enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio exceeds 65 % , the covenants on some of those lines are broken . after the $ 1 . 2 billion equity writedown and other charges taken in the third quarter , that ratio is probably about 50 % - 55 % ( enron hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact calculation ) . it would take $ 3 billion in further writedowns or charges to push enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio up to 65 % . stocks more static for enron forbes . com staff , forbes . com 10 . 23 . 01 , 11 : 15 am et new york - enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning , after it disclosed yesterday that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . enron ( nyse : ene ) last week reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . the market took that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement and disclosed that $ 35 million of those losses were connected with the two limited partnerships run by fastow . enron shares , which plunged 23 % last week , nosedived another 21 % yesterday . enron bounced back slightly in morning trading . the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling . aes says indian state interfering in ops , complains to pm 10 / 23 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new delhi ( ap ) - - after enron corp . it is the turn of u . s . - based aes corp . to seek the indian prime minister ' s help to settle its grievances with a state government . in a letter to atal bihari vajpayee , aes corp . ' s president dennis w . bakke said his company ' s determination to continue in india was being tested by the government of eastern orissa state . the letter , a copy of which was made available to the associated press tuesday , was dated oct . 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee . the virginia - based energy company operates two power plants in orissa , holds 49 % of the orissa power generation corp . and manages the main power distribution company in the state . aes corp . is the other major american power company besides enron corp . to have made big investments in india after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990 s . in his letter , bakke drew vajpayee ' s attention to the " expropriation , repeated contract violations , intimidation . . . and direct interference with day - to - day management " by the state government and its agencies . the letter also complained about government - run agencies failing to pay 2 . 1 billion rupees ( $ 1  inr 47 . 985 ) in bills .

2	Subject: sec var in december we entered two swaps on enron stock to hedge out the exposure we created by granting options . we consider them trading securities , so i have included them in the spreadsheet accordingly . gail tholen explained to me that we have long term contracts to remove the variability of revenues in bammel looper and mid texas . i have changed the total return swap model to use the volatility of prices in 2013 ( when the contracts expire ) , rather than spot volatilities . as a result , december var for total return swaps fell from $ 34 to $ 28 million . with the partly offsetting effects of the new enron stock and total return swaps , december var for trading securities therefore fell from $ 70 to $ 68 million . i recalculated total return swap var for the rest of 2000 using volatilities for 2013 . nevertheless , the impact is small , since spot volatilities were not as high throughout the year as in december . as a matter of fact , the average , high , and low trading securities vars for 2000 remain largely unchanged . regards , eugenio

2	Subject: re : spreadsheet for george posey vince - here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church . first off , it appears from the data that a special " appeal " for fund giving was made ( from the pulpit ? ) on april 19 , 1998 and april 25 , 1999 , ( perhaps tied rhetorically into income taxes ? ) . then , by going back and incorporating obvious dates from the calendars for 1997 - 1999 , the following regression analysis is made , where each effect is added independently : giving this sunday  $ 4403 + a minor $ 3 weekly time trend ( i . e . , multiply by the number of weeks since jan . 5 , 1997 ) + no pure effect from last week ' s contributions ( i . e . , denies first - order autoregressive effects ) + $ 2426 if easter sunday or the sunday nearest christmas + $ 9695 if ( pastoral appeal ) april 19 , 1998 or april 25 , 1999 - $ 340 if the sunday falls on the weekend of a monday federal holiday - $ 50 if the sunday following thanksgiving - $ 73 if a summer weekend ( june 1 thru august 31 ) the pure time trend is very small , so an annual projection based on all 3 years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ( $ 150 ) for 2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this april . clayton

" the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on " essentially the same terms " as they have in the past . " there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , " he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances . the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said . bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . " confidence in this company was lost , " said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . " but confidence will be restored . " corporations of enron ' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . manager ' s journal : how enron ran out of gas by paul kedrosky 10 / 29 / 2001 the wall street journal a 22 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) is troubled enron corp . the long term capital management of the energy markets , or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases ? or is poor enron just misunderstood ? those are the questions after another week of chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered houston - based energy concern . a year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron ' s shares gained 89 % during 2000 . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up 25 % , and revenues more than doubled . not bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago 80 % of enron ' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by 2000 , around 95 % of its revenues and more than 80 % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers . the stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around 55 times earnings . that ' s more like cisco ' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2 . 5 times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy . but enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a " new economy " web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company ' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ 126 , more than double its price then . then the new economy motor stalled . the company ' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron ' s machinations in california ' s energy markets . investors pored over enron ' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company ' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron ' s troubles were hiding in plain sight . it should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn ' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad . not that enron didn ' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter . enron ' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron ' s march 2000 10 - k , a " senior officer of enron is the managing member " of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron " manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . " it was , in a phrase , enron ' s house hedge fund . there is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done . as stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow ' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm ' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers . to be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003 . we didn ' t do anything wrong is mr . lay ' s refrain in the company ' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency . where has enron ' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron ' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves . - - - mr . kedrosky is a professor of business at the university of british colombia . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a enron seeks additional financing by richard a . oppel jr . 10 / 29 / 2001 the new york times page 9 , column 4 c . 2001 new york times company dallas , oct . 28 - - the enron corporation , still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer , is seeking $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks , an industry official said today . last week , enron , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , used about $ 3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $ 2 billion to pay off commercial paper . now , by obtaining even more financing , enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy - trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it . enron ' s board , which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company ' s financial situation , held another meeting this afternoon . ' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said . two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting . enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating . copyright ? 2000 dow jones oct 29 , 2001 by agencies : agency material and elizabeth wine enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue . more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar . mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders . janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn . the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january . most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are " dated " , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed . morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been " lightening up " their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when . ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been " trimmed substantially " . other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund . copyright : the financial times limited comment & analysis - enron flickers . by simon london and sheila mcnulty . 10 / 29 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty . enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind . its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these " related - party transactions " . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed . with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity . " this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , " observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank . on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle " new economy " magic on to old economy companies . enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading . for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it . the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets . the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : " it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . " the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a " loose - tight " management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets . up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years . balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : " as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . " this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company . it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider . in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing . in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation . a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . " they went after too many things too quickly , " says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency . a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed . david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : " the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . " the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . " the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , " argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . " power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . " enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise . " they over - promised on the new business they created , " says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . " enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . " will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets . and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

" once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up , that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest , " mr palmer said . the company ' s problems have become public since an announcement on october 16 that it would take a $ 1 . 01 bn special charge and write down shareholders ' equity by another $ 1 . 2 bn . the moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , who was forced to take a leave of absence last week . enron ' s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the october 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically " junk " status , though its official ratings are still investment grade . " our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations , " said raymond niles of salomon smith barney . " these activities require at least an investment grade credit rating , or enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements .

" one is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them . and two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth , " patterson said . as earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward , some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment . and plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off . shares of enron slid $ 1 . 05 , or 6 . 4 percent , to $ 15 . 30 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange on friday . the world has changed aes corp . , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in brazil and britain , said thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets . " it ' s a different place , " aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company . " the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , " said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman . return to traditional values bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business . it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise . " calpine does it already , " he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . " what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , " he added . howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies . smaller companies also rethink strategies as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line . " earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . " said patterson . michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america . cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments . allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings . the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time .

' ' but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting . some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value . enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day . the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company . the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached . enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas . the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch . the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash . enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide . the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year . philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations . ' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' ' in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company . a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits . enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades . ' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo . for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 . ' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said . still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation . mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business . but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements . now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask . to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances . the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference . deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships . enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report . the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose . in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors . mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company . in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' ' mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year . in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming . david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call . to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume . ' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' ' but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years . now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy . ' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' ' ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said . short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say . ' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' ' james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits . even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy . ' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist . in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission . enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices . large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states . before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power . beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business . the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' ' for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement . enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that . enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not . enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound . but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight . photos : enron , which is building a new headquarters in houston , grew with deregulation . but with deregulation in doubt , enron stock has dropped .

' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings . q . is that legal under the accounting rules ? a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 databank investors seem to ignore discouraging news by michael brick 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 17 , column 3 c . 2001 new york times company investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor . the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 . investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent . all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates . the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 . michael brick charts : ' ' stocks in the news ' ' enron nyse : ene the energy trading company ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron caught the attention of the s . e . c . friday ' s close : $ 15 . 40 week ' s change : - 40 . 88 % est .

" what they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business , " said robin west , chairman of the petroleum finance company , the industry consultants . " in a situation like this , cash is king . " enron ' s biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties , such as duke energy and reliant resources , start asking it for more collateral , increasing the cost of its everyday business . if enron were downgraded to junk , the counterparties could do just that . so far , credit rating analysts say , enron ' s core business is holding up well . but their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal . enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting , but its most recent problems stem from the ljm private equity fund run by andy fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer . enron compensated its partners in this complex off - balance sheet structure by promising to give them enron shares , if the value of private equity investments in the new power company , technology and other things fell below a certain level . those investments fell $ 1 . 2 bn in value from the threshold level , which should have triggered the issue of 62 m shares if the deal had not been reversed . the complex deal was designed to make sure enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that jp morgan chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market .

" enron ' s most recent woes began oct . 16 when its third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest . the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company ' s newer businesses such as broadband trading . fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise . the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence . now enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper . this is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer , and often with more flexible terms . " to some extent , redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets , which look at it negatively , " said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan . but reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , he said .

" jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons & co . , said enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned . in a worst - case scenario , investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down , which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of enron . that could lead to lower credit ratings , which would force enron ' s energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it . " thus , we see a big incentive for enron to clarify the issues , " dietert wrote in a report friday . " our gut feel is that enron can pull it off . " feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store . for example , a wall street journal article friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to enron known as chewco . it was formed in 1997 with about $ 400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed enron assets . chewco was run by michael kopper , a managing director of enron ' s global equity markets group . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business enron says microsoft breached contract staff 10 / 27 / 2001 houston chronicle 3 star 2 ( copyright 2001 ) enron corp . filed suit against microsoft corp . in state district court in houston this week , claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high - speed internet service . the companies entered into an agreement last june in which enron would provide internet bandwidth to microsoft as it rolled out its msn broadband service . enron ' s broadband network would link msn customers in over two dozen states , including texas . qwest communications is providing the internet infrastructure in 14 other states for msn . on oct . 23 , microsoft said that enron would have breached the contract if it didn ' t provide an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , according to bloomberg news . in the lawsuit , enron claims microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project ' s first phase . the lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the msn service in all but the 14 states served by qwest . enron officials declined to comment . a microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was " confident that we have upheld our agreement with enron .

' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees . to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge . mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today . the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern . pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist . it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag . as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' ' ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) . if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion . the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment . since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing .

" it is one of the items on the agenda , " the paper quoted a senior banker as saying . the paper said once dabhol serves the final notice , the matter proceeds to arbitration , which would not help india . " the widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation dpc will win hands down , " the paper added . a dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately . the source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far . the indian government has not responded to enron ' s offer to buy its equity , but two indian companies , bses ltd and tata power ltd , have shown interest . they have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced , and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount . local business daily , the economic times reported on friday that tata power and bses are willing to pay the founders $ 450 - $ 600 million for the 85 percent stake held by enron , ge and bechtel . enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $ 1 billion , the paper added . officials of tata power and bses were not immediately available for comment .

2	Subject: letter from : daniel kabila letter from : daniel kabila investment offer . dear , in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory . i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation . when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction ( fax and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining 80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends yielding . whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family . best regards , daniel kabila

2	Subject: august palo verde my latest information on rate increases in california indicates that they will be implemented june lst . that means that customers don ' t see a price signal until june and won ' t actually see their bill until july . while i agree with greg that we may see dramatic demand side response once people see their bills , we have no idea how long it will take people and businesses to adjust their behavior . i don ' t really care what positions you guys want to carry . my only advice is that greg is short a fairly illiquid product . if you want to get out right now you would have to pay , at least for some of your position , north of $ 800 / mwh . in the near term i don ' t think that it will be easy to get out of this trade . in the long run , if the market comes off , it will be easy to get out . bottom line - - at the end of the day i think that you may be right , but things look very bullish right now . i want to make sure that you know that you have already pushed the bounds of liquidity for that product and that you should not expect us to provide liquidity to you in a market that doesn ' t offer it to us when it is time to get out .

2	Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses vince - here is the basic idea i was alluding to : suppose a car dealer promised to " match any advertised price . " then his competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all dealers advertised they would " match any advertised price . " now , consider one of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so , everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars . now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to " control " who they are in business with , by putting a " right of first refusal " clause into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a " good " one from your perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers he receives for them . the " right of first refusal " clause precludes economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares ( essentially ) illiquid . clayton

2	Subject: california update 6 / 08 / 01 cpuc delays qf payment vote sources believe that the delay in the puc vote on paying the qfs 15 % of their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a " preference payment " to the qfs ( the puc does follow these issues out of necessity , given the current environment ) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15 % payment . the delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the puc operates . it is also noted that there are many claims on socal ' s and pg & e ' s cash flows currently . additionally , agreeing to pay 15 % of debts to the qfs raises legal issues , in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors , but not others . this could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against socal by the non - qf creditors .

2	Subject: re : trading support operations - london fernley , on january 25 , 1999 , i had breakfast in london with a shaking richard sage who recounted the tail of barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what jeff skilling told him to do in the previous november . subsequently , richard was " moved " from his position and barry promoted . if that is dealing with the situation , this actually reflects on your credibility . if you think that an open communication , independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in houston and london by virtue of your promotion of barry twice in 12 months , then you are sorely mistaken . on february 2 , 2000 the arthur andersen team , including tom bauer , john sorrells and jim brown stated that barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the audit tasks from london . i am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here . you have dismissed my " advice " and you need to do what you need to do . if the goal is to get me to change my view , you have a big hole to dig out of . i obviously can ' t change your point of view . i still feel a responsiblity to express the views that i have and others are afraid to surface . it is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere . need i go on . let us stop the e - mail wars now . they serve no productive purpose . ted fernley dyson 02 / 09 / 2000 04 : 56 am to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect cc : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : trading support operations - london ted , we have had discussions about barry in the past and i have followed - up on specific instances you have mentioned - i believe they date back to 1998 and prior to my first hand experience of working with barry throughout 1999 , and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then . we are not so barry - dependent . we have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the rac team ( david port , oliver gaylard ) . barry ' s role is much less hands - on now and he is not our candidate for the global products position - this will continue to be kevin sweeney . the role i suggest for barry is the high level co - ordination of the operations team - his energy , enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan , combined with his considerable institutional knowledge , making a superior candidate difficult to find . frankly , i suggested steve young not for additional depth , but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists - i do not belittle this issue , and while i don ' t think that anyone can point to any " prosecutable " offences that barry may have committed in recent history , his management style doesn ' t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective . i will say that he has always been open and frank ( very frank ) with me - indeed if mally and sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on helsinki . as an aside , i have not been involved in or consulted on the ' world tour ' , although i know that barry suggested this sort of thing to sally a few weeks back . i think it is great that brent price is involved , but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too . regards fernley to : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect cc : rick buy , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : trading support operations - london fernley , as we discussed earlier this year , i have serious concerns about barry that i think are both well - founded and reasonably well documented . to be fair , i will say that since ql of last year , i have not seen any further " prosecutable " offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative . however , i am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation , particulary with as influential person as john sherriff in charge of the office . probably more to the point , it continues to concern me that london has not developed an operations team that is not so barry - dependent . evidence to this effect are , the fact that he is your only candidate for the global products position , that someone from houston has to be part of the " world tour " in europe ( brent price ) , that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in helsinki was david port or richard sage , and that your suggestion for additional depth is steve young . further for the record , i believe that i am not the only one with whom barry has a credibility issue - arthur andersen , other global products personnell , and other risk people in london have expressed similar concerns to me - i just happen to be the most vocal . ted fernley dyson 02 / 08 / 2000 04 : 07 pm to : richard causey / corp / enron @ enron cc : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : trading support operations - london rick , not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function , particularly as it relates to our global products business , we already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area . the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution . well - nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry understands this as well as anybody . if we had a more suitable candidate , we would give him / her the job . i have seen barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the team that we have built around him . i ' m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the global products support functions ' in to the fold ' . however , he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and , whilst i do not share ted ' s views , i do not hold barry out as a saint and i can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded . i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted within houston , who can instill confidence there . steve young ( head of rac in london ) may be an interesting option , although i ' m sure he would not be easy to replace . in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will be monitoring the situation very closely . regards fernley .

2	Subject: alliance info alert ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis * * omnibus order mobilizes ferc ' s entire energy pricing and infrastructure authority * * to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission facilities * * streamlines regulation of wholesale market , energy facilities siting and licensing * * promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand - response bidding * * order doesn ' t address price caps * * meeting with western state regulators / officials set for april 6 , 2001 in boise , idaho ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the stressed california and western energy markets . ferc proposes to increase bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification , licensing , and the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate commerce . ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and transmission capacity , as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale power transactions , as well as increase the capacity of the supporting infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines . the order , which sets new precedent in its broadness , also proposes actions to reduce electricity demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale - market portion of demand - response bidding where states wish to implement the retail side . ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future by march 30 , 2001 . effective immediately , ferc said in a statement , * the commission is streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales , expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california and the west , including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly address pending pipeline applications , and urging all licensees to review their ferc - licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential for increased generating capacity . * among the actions ferc takes are to : 1 ) require the california iso and transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed in the short term ; 2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december 31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating capacity . ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting environmental resources . in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 . increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 , 2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of service by november 1 , 2002 . in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on " quick fixes , " and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in demand in california . the order also " fails to address price relief , " noted massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206 investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said , appeared to be " just throwing money at the problem . " while generally disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the " same actions as authorized last may , " said massey . " they were good ideas then , and they are good ideas now , " he concluded . for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted , chairman hebert said the order was designed to " squeeze every additional mw of supply available " and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed that ferc is " doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . " he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation are generally state issues . ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at : citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 . a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals made follows : electric transmission infrastructure within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of rights of way . ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a 10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern california edison . system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year depreciable life . facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by november 1 , 2002 . for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate . extension of waivers for qfs ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april 30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 , 2001 . additional capacity from on - site generation ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 , 2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is required . allows demand response bidding ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires similar reporting . ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this . ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs . requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales . contract modifications for demand - response bidding there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs . interconnections fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 . ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section 210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring immediate action . longer term regional solutions ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and implementing a long - term regional solution . natural gas pipeline capacity ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this summer on constrained pipeline systems . hydroelectric power ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources . comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be implemented to provide efficiency upgrades . oil pipelines ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market . conference with state commissioners ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 , 2001 in boise , idaho .

2	Subject: california update 3 / 22 / 01 executive summary : ? the as yet unnumbered rescue bill by davis made it to the senate floor ? an exemption of the gas - fired qfs from this bill ( as proposed by sen . keeley ) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing . ? if passed , the draft cpuc order would give the utilities another 15 days after rate hikes to pay the qfs ? the negotiations with the qfs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the dwr . senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the dwr . ? the calenergy ruling ( as reported by bloomberg this pm ) is an attractive option for other qfs looking to at least temporarily escape long - term supply contracts with edison . ? if neither the cpuc nor the legislature exempts the gas - fired generators from the new rate structure , an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected . however , if the exemption is implemented , then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed . 1 . " qf bill " makes it to senate floor the " cpuc bill " ( the number is not yet known ) is in mock - up form and does the following : * repeals puc code section 390 , which set a formula for qfs under deregulation . * amends portions of ab lx which will ensure that dwr receives money for its power purchases , and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds . * includes a provision for sdg & e rates since they were not covered under other legislation . the bill passed the senate energy ( 8 - 2 ) , and also just passed the senate appropriations committee ( 8 - 2 ) and is headed to the senate floor . 2 . senator comments on the bill : keeley ( author of bill ) presented that the bill would allow the puc to decide the qf contracts which is the proper authority to debate the issue . most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the puc regarding voided costs for natural gas - fired qfs . republicans offered an amendment to not have section 390 repealed for gas - fired generators , but keeley had concerns with the amendment . keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the puc ' s flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad . he also indicated that gas - fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order . he said that the puc order needs to be amended , and keeley is confident that the puc has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 hours . 3 . opponents to the qf bill : the following people testified in opposition to qf portion : turn , delta power ( qf ) , syke energy , john hancock financial , california manufacturers association , crockett cogeneration , independent energy producers , clean power campaign , pg & e , sce . the gas - fired qfs that testified in opposition noted that they have been off - line for a couple of months and cannot come back on - line unless their issues are addressed . in response to the qfs not getting paid , sen . bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the qfs as directed under the draft order , then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy . 4 . pg & e and sce testimony : sen . battin asked both utilities about the draft order , which states that after the change in the rates by qfs the utilities must pay the qfs within 15 days , and whether the utilities would abide by the order . pg the draft order would lower the qf cost to $ 140 million . pg & e was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to battin ' s question was " yes or no . " battin , bowen and murray all asked whether it was yes or no . the pg & e rep stated that it would be " no " if the issue of the payments owed to iso and dwr is not resolved . if the iso costs of purchases were included in the dwr payments , then pg & e would not have a problem . the sce response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out , then it could not comply with the puc order . 5 . payments to dwr senator sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under ab lx that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the dwr for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those . sce responded that they are still in negotiations with dwr on the terms and conditions . several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill , and that they should have a trust fund set up . pg & e noted that they are setting ' some ' money aside , but would not state how much . sen . sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or ' go after them ' for violating the law . lx provisions : tim gage from dept . of finance noted the governor ' s support of the entire bill , and noted that the lx provisions would ensure that dwr gets paid . pg & e also testified in opposition to these provisions . senator bowen made the following statements : * senator peace has announced that he has received another notice of $ 500 million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless pg & e and sce drop their challenge to the puc regarding the dwr issue . * also stated that the puc could always raise rates as a way to resolve the issue .

( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million  1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million  . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb .

( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . stock set to explode on earnings boom : leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches unprecedented levels . required market mover stock report ( mmsr ) information : mmsr cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mmsr . mmsr recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mmsr is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mmsr is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mmsr has received twelve thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . mb nlz

2	Subject: re : big cowboy for august mary : is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where 985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume , and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350 mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of " nothing " being confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000 this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is calculating the volumes incorrectly . this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss . tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were originally set up in pops . i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you . thanks , fred tom acton @ enron 09 / 28 / 2000 08 : 10 am to : fred boas / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : big cowboy for august - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by tom acton / corp / enron on 09 / 28 / 2000 08 : 09 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary poorman 09 / 27 / 2000 03 : 56 pm to : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , tom acton / corp / enron @ enron cc : clem cernosek / hou / ect @ ect , howard b camp / hou / ect @ ect subject : big cowboy for august daren & tom , beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with zero noms flowed a considerable volume . they are as follows : rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx . big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx . total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and our economics . thank you , mary
