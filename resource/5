we | | we do know this - the great thing about investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or decline siightly , you will still make a very healthy return . of course , energy prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings wi | | soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be staggering . overall , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized , eogi shares wil | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oi | and gas reserves are weil established and are going into massive production . eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additional news in this area wil | realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets upward in next week ' s bu | | etin . oi | and gas advisory ( oga ) is not a investment expert . certain statements contained in this newsietter may be future - looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . such terms as expect , beiieve , may , will , and intend or simiiar terms may identify these statements . past - performance is not an indicator of future - results . this is not an expert to acquire or se | | securities . oga is an independent publication that was paid fifteen thousand doilars by a third party for the continuing coverage and dissemination of this company information . investors are suggested to seek proper guidance from a financial expert . investors should use the information provided in this newsietter as a starting point for gathering additiona | information on the profiled company to allow the investor to form their own opinion regarding investment . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you fee | you have been wrongfuily placed in our membership , please send a biank e mai | with no thanks in the subject to daily _ 4 tip @ yahoo . com

2	Subject: from david david makume tel + 27 83 730 5031 atten : ceo . dear sir / madam , you may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don ' t know me in person , but please take this mail into consideration . though , i do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in zimbabwe but it has formed consistent headlines in the cnn , bbc news bulletins , my name is david makume from zimbabwe , a country in southern africa . my father mr johnson makume , was a farmer in my country . my father was accused of sympathizing with white farmer against the wish our ruling government ( z . a . n . u . p . f ) and all their allies ( the war veteran ) they killed him . you can verify this from these international newspaper websites . before he was killed , my father made a deposit with a security company in south africa , and he confided in me that he left some money in a diplomatic trust company in abroad , ( name withheld for security reasons ) . this money was for expansion of his farm business to other parts of southern africa . all i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund ( sealed in diplomatic consignment ) from security company and invest in your country . when you claim the fund , i shall come over to your country with my mother and my siblings so that we can start a new life if you may ask why do i need a foreign assistance or why can ' t i take the cash transfer and myself ? the answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my father which states unambiguously that ' nobody , not even himself , can have access to the consignment in the company , and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside africa . this was done because he envisaged danger in the crisis that continued in our country ( zimbabwe ) and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund . my decision to contact you is therefore , informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world . i believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust i repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care . permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way . on my part , this is my assurance and guarantee to you . in as much as you follow my instructions carefully , religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch - free success remains unshakable . i have contacted the diplomatic security firm to confirm the deposit , which is worth twenty six million , five hundred thousand united state dollars only , ( $ 26 . 5 m ) you will be given 30 % of the total sum at the end of the transaction . if you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country . i want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction . kindly include your full names , private telephone and fax numbers where you can always be reach , to enable me send some other important information across to you . this proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and confidentiality . please reply to this sincerely , david makume

2	Subject: collaboration 25 / 11 / 04 dear friend , i suspect that you might be surprised to get this send from me as you originally do not know me . i am mr . ben williams , the only son of late mr . ndiovu williams , who was slain in a land dispute in zimbabwe . i got a hold of your profile from your country ? s web site and i thought that it may be worthwhile to contact and work with you . a few months before the death of my father , he had gone to holland to deposit the sum of us $ 4 , 000 , 000 ( four million us dollar ) , in a private security and finance company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this sum was meant for the purchase of chemicals and tractors for the development of our new farm in swaziland . however this problem came about when the zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe introduced a new land reform act , which utterly affected the rich white farmers and some black farmers . this resulted into killing and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society . several innocent people have lost their lives as a result of the land reform act , in which my father is unfortunately one of them . you could look up this information on cnn news daily for up date on the situation of the country . if however you are in doubt , you may also look up information pertaining to this fiasco from the internet on the following web site : www . dailynews . co . zw , in view of the above conditions my family and me whom are presently in zimbabwe decided to transfer our fathers money to a foreign account since the zimbabwean law prohibits refugees ( asylum seekers ) to operate any type of bank account or being involved in any enormous financial business deal . as the eldest issue of my father , i am in quest of for a genuine overseas collaborator who can help us transfer this money in to his or her oversea account . on the other hand , the zimbabwe government appears to be playing along with them . we are therefore faced with the dilemma of investing this money in zimbabwe for the fear of going through the same experience in future , as a businessperson whom i will entrust my future and that of my entire family in his hands , i must let you know that this business is completely 100 % harmless as we cannot accept to venture into any dangerous deal with our fortune . therefore if this request falls within your capacity , i would appreciate that you contact me urgently . i would also be available to attend to any question or concern that you may have per this matter . as gratitude for your assistance , we have proposed two options for you . 1 ) we ( you and me ) could go into partnership for a proper and profitable investment of the money in your country or stable economy . 2 ) i would be willing to give a flexible and negotiable percentage of 15 % of the total sum to you i assume that you would appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and the necessity for confidentiality of the same . you may reply to this send through my private mail box : benwilliams @ walla . com god bless you and your family . yours truly , ben williams ( for the family )

2	Subject: california update - - 08 . 30 . 01 late last evening the assembly committee passed its version of the edison mou ( sb 78 ) . despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and / or eliminate the da provisions in the bill , the bill passed with the da provisions intact . the da provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously ( see previous note attached ) . the assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the appropriations committee today or tomorrow - - the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee . when and if the bill makes it out of the appropriations committee , the assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full assembly . if it makes it out of the full assembly , it will then go to the senate for approval , where the leader of the senate , john burton , continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the senate are slim . on the puc front , efforts are underway to stop the puc from passing the proposal it issued last week . the current puc proposal would suspend da retroactive to july 1 . in conversations with the governor ' s point people in charge of getting the bill passed , they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the puc proposal and are working to resolve it . we ' ll continue to provide updates . if you have any questions , don ' t hesitate to contact me at 415 . 782 . 7822 . best , jeff - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dasovich , jeff sent : monday , august 27 , 2001 8 : 26 pm to : kean , steven j . ; kingerski , harry ; belden , tim ; sharp , vicki ; blachman , jeremy ; comnes , alan ; tribolet , michael ; walsh , kristin ; delainey , david ; leff , dan ; frazier , lamar ; keeney , kevin ; blachman , jeremy ; gahn , scott ; belden , tim ; swain , steve ; lavorato , john ; kaufman , paul ; steffes , james d . ; calger , christopher f . ; mara , susan ; black , don ; richter , jeff ; kitchen , louise ; dietrich , janet ; mara , susan ; robertson , linda ; kingerski , harry ; denne , karen ; palmer , mark a . ( pr ) ; shapiro , richard ; curry , wanda ; mellencamp , lisa subject : california update - - 08 . 27 . 01 the california puc loretta lynch held a press conference in sacramento today to discuss changes to the commission ' s previously released proposal regarding direct access and the rate agreement between the puc and dwr . in the amended proposal discussed and distributed today , direct access would end retroactive to july 1 . customers with contracts executed as of july 1 would would remain direct access customers . the legislature the assembly version of the senate mou ( sb 78 ) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the committee . it is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6 : 30 pm pdt today . amendments on direct access were released this afternoon ( based on negotiations between davis ' office and business customers ) : customers who have consistently been da since may 2000 , including those " involuntarily " returned to bundled service , would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts , and dwr - related exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers . customers who have consistently been on da between may 2000 and jan 17 , 2001 would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts and dwr - realted exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers . customers who have been on da between jan 17 , 2001 and august 24 , 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to dwr forward contracts , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers . customer ' s leaving after august 24 th would not qualify for exemptions . there is considerable work underway to make the august 24 th date the deadline for contract execution , rather than the date by which the customer must be dasr ' d , in order to qualify for the exemptions . direct access would not be suspended , however , until 90 days after the bill is signed by davis ( if he signs it ) , i . e . , the " effective date " of the bill . so anyone going to direct access between aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions . after the 90 - day period , da would be suspended until 1 . 1 . 03 . self - gen in service consistently from may 200 to august 24 would be exempt from edison ' s undercollection and dwr charges . self - gen that submitted an application to the energy commission by august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line . self - gen that comes on line after august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line , but the total number of exempt mws in this category would be limited to 250 mws per year , on a first - come - first - serve basis . at least 30 % of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen .

" the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy . the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco . chewco was established in 1997 " with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments " to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document . enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco . mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that " michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . " mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july . this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves " any director or executive officer . " by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have . however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a " material " piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and " other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management .

" many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises . strong selling by company officers and directors amid share - price declines should raise red flags for investors , says jonathan moreland , research director of insiderinsights . com , who uses insider - trading data to zero in on investment ideas . among other insiders selling during the year , kenneth rice , former chairman and ceo of enron ' s broadband unit , sold shares for $ 23 . 7 million . mr . rice has sold 456 , 966 shares of the 1 . 5 million shares he was listed as owning in enron ' s march proxy filing . former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling - - who resigned in august - - sold 160 , 000 shares for $ 9 . 8 million during the year . in march , mr . skilling owned 1 . 9 million shares . messrs . rice and skilling couldn ' t be reached to comment . overall , enron ' s insiders were busier selling shares last year , when they sold 5 . 8 million shares for about $ 449 million . during 1999 , insiders sold 3 . 4 million shares for $ 123 . 1 million . since december 1999 , only one enron executive has reported buying company shares . the buyer was andrew fastow , who was ousted during the week as enron ' s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr . fastow . mr . fastow reported purchasing 10 , 000 enron shares in august at $ 36 . 98 each , or a total of $ 369 , 800 . today , those shares are valued at $ 163 , 500 , based on enron ' s stock price of $ 16 . 35 in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . after the purchase , mr . fastow owned 110 , 586 shares , thomson financial / lancer analytics says . enron said mr . fastow wasn ' t available to comment . on monday , a new york law firm filed suit in u . s . district court in houston , alleging that enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by mr . fastow . the suit , which seeks class - action status , also says enron insiders sold $ 73 million of their own enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets enron ' s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit - rating concerns by jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee staff reporters of the wall street journal 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 5 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - - enron corp . ' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse . not for long , some bond traders say . in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks . that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of " spread " is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower . enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade . fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer . " even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest , " said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j . in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a " default swap " - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year . even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level . yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to " negative , " citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . ) meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . " these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels , " said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . " they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction . " if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments . enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets . enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity .

" so is this a stock to avoid , in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its " u . s . select list , " which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious " recommended list " of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 . " just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , ' " says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . " if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow . " enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week . " every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box , " says jim chanos , principal of kynikos associates in new york , who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . " it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . " true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had . but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ? concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions . besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings . through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a " strong buy " or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a " buy , " though not strongly . only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a " sell " rating on enron . the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted . over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue . enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch . " enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved , " says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a " strong buy " with a $ 40 price target . " they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . " he adds , " we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that ' s ludicrous . we ' re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes , i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don ' t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . " mr . fleischer , whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron , calls his holding " a meaningful investment " that is " not small . " but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients " are happy to know " he has a stake in enron , because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is . in his research note wednesday , mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company , he wrote that he and many other investors historically " have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings " and position as an industry leader . " there ' s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they ' re going to make their money , but every quarter they do , " he says . " it ' s hard to get inside to know all the transactions , but they do deliver . " csfb ' s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company , occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday , he wrote that he expects questions about enron ' s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue , but that he remains " confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . " " i know i ' m wrong on the stock , " mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices , he isn ' t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares , diluting current holders - - the stock doesn ' t have much further to fall . clearly , messrs . launer and flesicher aren ' t alone . " even in relative terms , analysts remain very bullish on this stock , " says chuck hill , director of research at thomson financial / first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 , or slightly shy of a " buy " rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . " this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out , " mr . hill says . in downgrading the stock this week , prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to " sell " from " buy , " with a brief stop at " hold . " while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock , she openly concedes her recent downgrades come " too little , too late . " ms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company ' s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal , and senior executives are often evasive , even when presented with direct questions . for instance , she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said " no , " she says . in light of the company ' s acknowledgment this week of an sec " inquiry , " she asked enron about the previous denial . " they told me it is an inquiry , not an investigation , " she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec ' s inquiry only last wednesday . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence 2001 - 10 - 26 08 : 52 ( new york ) enron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , whose stock has fallen on concern about the largest energy trader ' s transactions with affiliates , drew down $ 3 billion in credit to restore confidence in its financial strength . the houston - based company will use about $ 2 . 2 billion to pay off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash , spokesman mark palmer said . ` ` nothing instils confidence like cash , ' ' he said . enron ' s shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as investors worry that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . investors say they are worried about $ 3 . 3 billion in liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell enron assets . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the company $ 35 million . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay said in a statement . enron shares fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 yesterday . - - mark johnson in the princeton newsroom ( 609 ) 750 - 4662 , or at enron liked by analysts despite complicated dealings , wsj says 2001 - 10 - 26 06 : 12 ( new york ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is liked by many wall street analysts despite lingering questions about the power trading company ' s complicated partnership transactions and the techniques used to record earnings , the wall street journal reported in its ` ` heard on the street ' ' column . goldman sachs group inc . analyst david fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares , said that even though inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the company , that doesn ' t mean he will write off the industry or not analyze enron . of the 17 analysts who follow the stock , 10 had a ` ` strong buy ' ' or equivalent rating , according to thomson financial / first call , the paper said . five rated it ` ` buy ' ' and one had a ` ` sell ' ' on enron . most analysts have stuck by the company , publicly dismissing questions about enron ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure , the journal said . the securities and exchange commission is inquiring about partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . enron draws down $ 3 billion from its credit lines , wsj reports 2001 - 10 - 26 00 : 28 ( new york ) new york , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion of its available credit , the bulk of its bank credit lines , to restore confidence in the financial strength of the company , the wall street journal reported . the energy trading company , whose shares have fallen 52 percent since oct . 16 , will use part of the money to redeem about $ 1 . 85 billion short - term commercial debt , the wall street journal reported , citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter . enron is talking to banks about a new , multi - billion line of credit , the paper reported , citing the unidentified person . the steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is disrupted , the paper said . enron said in a statement distributed by pr newswire that it drew on its credit lines to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity . the steps come a day after chief financial officer andrew fastow resigned amid a securities and exchange commission probe of partnerships he ran . - - william selway in the san francisco newsroom at ( 415 ) 743 - 3511 , oct . 25 , 2001 , 11 : 22 pm houston chronicle action by enron halts stock ' s fall but credit ratings are being reviewed by laura goldberg copyright 2001 houston chronicle the recent freefall of enron corp .

" earlier thursday , two credit rating agencies took actions regarding enron ' s ratings , which j . p . morgan securities analyst anatol feygin described as " just more negative sentiment .

" we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business , " said newly appointed chief financial officer jeff mcmahon . " this is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in enron . additionally , we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long - term credit rating .

" the economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists , " says betsy holahan , a department spokesperson . " war bonds are an additional way for americans to show their patriotism . " for the record , we don ' t think an issue of war bonds would be dumb , just superfluous . after all , nothing ' s stopped americans from buying generic savings bonds - - or better yet , treasuries - - all of which finance spending by the federal government . in the meantime , it ' s a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds - - which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice - - at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop . war bonds notwithstanding , we ' re a long way off from the era of ration books . 3 . enron again last week , we noted the extent of alarm about enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $ 1 . 2 billion , following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high - level transactions . following that disclosure , besieged cfo andrew fastow has finally left the company on what ' s delicately termed a " leave of absence . " in july , fastow exited a limited partnership , from which he had reportedly reaped large profits , after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement . concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence . but that won ' t be an easy task , given the resentment about enron ' s disinclination to explain its problems . one analyst called fastow ' s departure " unsettling , " noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before . sounding a note of exasperation , analysts at j . p . morgan chase , banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock . and there could be more trouble to come : the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions . 4 . gold diggers it ' s understandable that investors felt panicky in september . unfortunately , some reacted by shoving their hard - earned money into gold funds . according to financial research corp . , which tracks fund flows , the specialty precious - metals category was the best - selling equity category during september , with net inflows of $ 101 million . granted , that ' s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world . by comparison , during the same month , large growth funds saw net redemptions of $ 7 . 4 billion . but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy , given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long . sure , under the bizarre circumstances of late , they ' ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop . according to morningstar , the average precious - metals fund is up 10 . 08 % year to date . but over the past five years , the same category lost an embarrassing 14 . 68 % . by comparison , even large - cap growth funds - - everybody ' s favorite whipping boy - - managed to post a positive return . in the same period , they were up 7 . 13 % . moreover , circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades - - a combination of attacks on the u . s . government and war - - still don ' t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly . despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks , they ' re again approaching their pre - sept . 11 levels . it ' s too early to say , but it ' s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again . 5 . amazon amazes once again amazon ( amzn : nasdaq - news - commentary ) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter . well , at least it will post a pro forma operating profit . ok , so maybe that wouldn ' t include amazon ' s service on $ 2 . 17 billion in long - term debt or extraordinary charges . in fact , a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy , meaningless aura of minor triumph . the company still hasn ' t said when it will turn an economic profit . for that matter , even the fourth - quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit , cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier , " there are no guarantees .

" they created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn ' t come through with flying colors , " said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group in new york . enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old , which have little to do with the company ' s wholesale energy business , which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits . analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices . " even though ( enron ) shot themselves in the foot , the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear , " ellinghaus said . ubs warburg analyst ronald barone echoed that sentiment . " the collateral damage to the rest of the space - dynegy and el paso - is overdone , " barone said . on thursday , williams companies inc . of tulsa , okla . , reported net income of $ 760 million and reliant resources inc . of houston reported $ 133 million in profits . " it ' s business as usual , " said dynegy spokesman steve stengel . not for enron , whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india and the surprise departure in august of then - chief executive jeff skilling was considered another bad sign . on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . excluding the charge , enron earned $ 393 million on $ 47 . 6 billion in revenues for the three months ending sept . 30 . ellinghaus said the stocks of enron ' s competitors were brought down wednesday because of " dire " speculation that enron ' s troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as duke and dynegy . " all i ' m hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality , " ellinghaus said . enron did not return calls seeking comment thursday . donnell of duke energy said the charlotte , n . c . - based company is paying close attention to the enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid .

2	Subject: re : dun & bradstreet info for credit trading thank you for keeping us in the loop on this . d & b data will become one of our most important sources . as you suggest , the intent is to use this data along with other available date to generate a price for credit . the price will be published externally ( likely for a fee and as a free service ) via the web or via automated processes . option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to date data as possible . stuart is working with the credit team to define additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely what we are looking for . alternatively , if it is possible to obtain the actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to generate our own score in addition to d & b ' s . we will need the global failure score as well . currently we are active in europe as well as the us and expect to move towards asia and austrailia over time . hopefully , this data is available via d & b connect . another consideration is the term of contract . we would likely prefer a longer term contract so that if they decide they don ' t like what we are doing with the data , we cannot be cut off . does it make sense from your perspective to approach d & b to be our long term , strategic providor of customer data . this would likely make their deal maker look good in his boss ' s eyes , give you lot ' s of negotiating ability and give a us the long term preferential contract that we are looking for . let ' s discuss further . bryan mary solmonson 05 / 05 / 2000 19 : 25 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect cc : philippe a bibi / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , stuart ffoulkes / lon / ect @ ect subject : dun & bradstreet info for credit trading i have received preliminary information from d & b . i think several issues / questions have been raised that if explored , could result in a better solution for the money . option 1 the update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to monthly for a cost of $ 87 , 000 ( usd ) through march , 2001 . option 2 i wasn ' t sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in . if you are particularly interested in the financial stress score and credit score , for example , there are multiple alternatives : 2 a ) keep quartlery refresh of base data ( party name , etc ) and refresh scores that are added / changed on a monthly basis . cost - $ 1 . 17 ( usd ) per record . note that there are 575 , 000 records in the file currently with financial and credit scores , making this potentially a very expensive alternative ( 575 , 000 x 1 . 17  $ 672 , 750 ) . 2 b ) batch or ftp updates of the financial and stress scores can only be provided monthly . d & b is working on a solution that would provide a weekly update to their customers in a batch or ftp manner , but has not committed to when this will be ready . therefore , if more timely updates than monthly are desired , it is also possible to transactionally access records one at a time using d & b ' s software . the cost for this is extremely high at $ 10 . 52 ( usd ) per score . option 3 d & b connect product . d & b connect is a tool set of matching software , an externally validated reference file , credit and marketing information , and d & b services that enables the most effective integration of customer information and third - party information with d & b information . only this type of process and information integration capability can facilitate and ensure accurate identification , linkage and maintenance of your customer ' s complete relationship . in addition , d & b connect assures organizations of referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to d & b so that the most recent d & b information is always transmitted to your organization and updated within your local d & b connect reference file . d & b connect is scalable . cost typically ranging from * customer access module ( cam ) batch - - $ 25 , 000 * cam online - $ 50 , 000 * full information integrator - $ 350 , 000 + data with more specifics as to your needs , this option should perhaps be pursued . questions / issues 1 ) d & b had questions regarding the use of their data and whether enron customers would be offered this information for a fee or free . i explained that i did not feel the data would be offered directly to enron customers , but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available externally via web site , etc . all pricing above is based upon this understanding . if i have not portrayed the usage correctly , it will be imperative to get a better understanding before final pricing can be negotiated . 2 ) are there specific data elements that you are interested in ? alternatives may vary by data element . financial stress score and credit score reference above were explored as an example . 3 ) what is timeframe for needing a solution ? 4 ) financial stress score and credit score are only available on u . s . companies . a comparable measure - global failure score ( the liklihood of default or bankruptcy ) is available for international companies . this rating score however , is not currently available via a batch or ftp manner . this could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this score in a batch manner . 5 ) pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes . this is probably negotiable as the data is the same . the thought process is that if the repository is used for credit or risk decisions , d & b will see decreased usage and revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments . if you would like me to follow up further , please give me a call at 713 - 853 - 6079 .

2	Subject: folks , attached is a conservative ( and fairly rough ) estimate of the size of the petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged drought in southern texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and possible curtailed production . the total annual revenue generated by these assets is no less than $ 20 b and could be substantially higher as the estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable . note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial complexes from houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to experience such a drought - induced interruption . the only facilties identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers : brazos , colorado , navidad , guadalupe , and nueces . please let me know if you have any questions / comments as we work to determine whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable . thanks , charlie 
2	Subject: refined products line - - north american markets - cera alert : decem ber 15 , 2000 cera alert : december 15 , 2000 title : refined products line - - north american markets cera knowledge areas : refined products us margin highlights * responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels , us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average $ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel lower than this year ' s first quarter average . * high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly , averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter . * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of $ 5 . 75 per barrel . * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the historical range . us demand highlights * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago . cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 . * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories , particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year . * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline , apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter . * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd range during the first quarter of 2001 . us inventory highlights * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year . * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period . primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather , refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirements - albeit at a high price . * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter . * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks . * * end * * this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours . this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

2	Subject: overview of investor conference call today , enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company . here ' s an update of what we discussed during the call . we told investors that we ' re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence . our focus remains on our credit quality , balance sheet and liquidity , which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses . it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today . here ' s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation : - - in hindsight , we definitely made some very bad investments in our non - core businesses over the past several years . those include investments in azurix , india and brazil . they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments ; - - because of these bad investments , we ' ve become over - leveraged as a company . the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet ; - - we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence , which has been very damaging ; - - we ' ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard - to - understand financial and operating disclosures ; and - - on top of it all , we discovered errors in our financial statements , as discussed in our 8 - k filing last week , that required a restatement of previously reported earnings . we ' ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas : core businesses , non - core businesses , and businesses under review . core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company . they ' re our competitive advantage . these include : - - natural gas pipeline businesses ; - - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ; - - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and - - coal businesses in north america and europe . the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it ' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 . i also remain optimistic that the actions we ' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships . non - core businesses our non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal . we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals . businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation . reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available . credit rating / 10 - q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows : - - moody ' s at baa 3 " under review for further downgrade " - - fitch at bbb - " evolving status " - - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 . in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered " participants in the solicitation " of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .

2	Subject: god bless you as you responed back dear beloved in christ , i am the above named person from malaysia . i am married to dr . peter kim who worked with australia embassy in brazil for nine years before he died in the year 2000 . we were married for eleven years without a child . he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days . before his death we were muslims . since his death i decided not to re - marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is against . when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $ 10 . 5 million ( ten million five hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) in a finance bank . presently , this money is still with the security company . recently , my doctor told me that i would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . having known my condition i decided to donate this fund to charitable organisation or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct here in . i want an organisation or individual that will use this to fund churches , orphanages and widows propagating the word of god and to ensure that the house of god is maintained . the bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth . i took this decision because i don ' t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not christians and i don t want my husband ' s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers . i don ' t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner , hence the reason for taking this bold decision . i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in the bossom of the lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace . i don t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health , and because of the presence of my husband ' s relatives around me always . i don t want them to know about this development . with god all things are possible . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of the finance bank . i will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original - beneficiary of this fund . i want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd . my happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose . please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated herein . hoping to hear from you . please get in touch with me on this e -

2	Subject: judicial judgments - child support lm thank you for your interest ! judgment courses offers an extensive training course in " how to collect moneyjudgments " if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote ' s from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : " i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on " after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : " i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now " after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated " i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out " marshal in area code 407 states to us " i feel bad , you only charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months " > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1 - 281 - 500 - 4018 . we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to 10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + this ad is produced and sent out by : uas to be deleted from our mailing list please email us at roanna @ elitists . com with " delete " in the sub - line . or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a + + + + + + to 48 5 - 19 cl 8 p 3245611515161654646565 unbelievable unbelievable processing - - - - - - - - - - - for - - - - - - - - - your - - - - - - - - - - - - future unbelievable

users , rights , books , global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis . some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other . 3 ) integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work . we will not be testing functional permutations , data conditions , validation or exceptions to any significant degree . 4 ) each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing . we are operating from the premise that data , infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts . 4 ) all systems will be physically split ( even unify at this point ) . 5 ) integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co . 6 ) we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production . 7 ) we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes . there are two teams - conversion and integration test . each team will focus on both estate and new co . resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility . 8 ) estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest . estate conversion is on the critical path for new co . key issues 1 ) we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first , then physical . if financial is the focus , delivery risk goes down dramatically . for now , we must plan on the worst case - - physical and financial on jan 20 . 2 ) we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate . this means that we need a dev environment ( and hw gap addressed ) for unify , sitara , cpr , tagg / erms . conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we ' re in synch . 3 ) unify servers probably can ' t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify . 4 ) some systems are using ' short name ' instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global . the global , tagg / erms , unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks . 5 ) we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates . we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading . 6 ) we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep / bridgeline considerations . the time window will be very small . core conversion team 1 ) steve stock -

2	Subject: change of control provisions as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million . many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision . i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry . thank you .

2	Subject: [ ilug ] please kindly get back to me from : mr . desmond stevens urgent assistance . you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . i am mr . desmond stevens , the first son of dr . dennis stevens , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam , the netherlands and decided to write you . before the death of my father , he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) in a security company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . infact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my father  s money to a foreign account . since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction . as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam , the netherlands so that you can open the non - resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . this money i intend to use for investment . i have options to offer you , first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever option you choose , feel free to notify me . i have mapped out 5 % of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction . if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 25 % of the money while the remaining 70 % that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country . please , contact me with the above telephone and e - mail address , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction . yours faithfully , desmond stevens . - - irish linux users ' group : ilug @ linux . ie http : / / www . linux . ie / mailman / listinfo / ilug for ( un ) subscription information . list maintainer : listmaster @ linux . ie

2	Subject: news alert ( otcbb : fnpr ) makes great breakthrough " the stock to watch " fnpr highlights press release mr . alvin snaper has served as a senior consultant to other major corporations and organizations , including ibm , general foods , nasa , boeing , gillette , singer , u . s . air force , rocketdyne , general motors , lockheed aircraft , sanyo , philips , gulf western , union carbide , etc . some of his inventions and commercial products include the ibm selectric type ball , tang , the nasa apollo photo - pack , coating process for gillette razor blades , and the electrostatic painting process & system for auto components assemblies for general motors , to name a few . mr . alvin snaper holds the single honor and individual distinction of being recognized three times with ' best patent of the year ' award by design news magazine , and is the author of numerous technical and scientific papers . market size and market growth record growth for global wind power in 2002 ( 2003 figures not available yet ) increased by 28 % , wind technology worth $ 7 . 3 billion dollars installed last year a record 6 , 868 megawatts ( mw ) of new wind power capacity was installed worldwide in 2002 , increasing generating capacity by 28 % last year , according to new figures released from the american wind energy association ( awea ) and european wind energy association ( ewea ) . wind power technology worth 6 . 8 billion ( $ 7 . 3 billion ) was installed globally in 2002 , driving total wind power installation to over 31 , 000 megawatts ( mw ) , enough to power 7 . 5 million average american homes ( 16 million average european homes ) . global wind power capacity has quadrupled over the past five years , growing from 7 , 600 mw at the end of 1997 to more than 31 , 000 mw at the end of 2002 - an increase of over 23 , 000 mw . wind is the world ' s fastest - growing energy source , with installed generating capacity increasing by an average 32 % annually for the last five years ( 1998 - 2002 ) . 93 % of the additional wind power capacity installed in 2002 was in europe and the united states , and worldwide 90 % of capacity is found in those two regions . wind energy grew by 10 % in the united states in 2002 , a good performance given the poor state of the u . s . energy market and the stop - and - go - and - stop - again policy signals directed at our industry , said awea executive director randall swisher . with steady supportive policies , wind power could grow at a sustained pace closer to that of europe , and provide well over 6 % of u . s . electricity by 2020 . over 75 % of the world ' s wind power is generated in europe , and the region again fuelled the bulk of last year ' s growth an achievement that flows from a steady commitment to developing renewable sources of energy . a total of 5 , 871 mw worth 5 . 8 billion ( $ 6 . 2 billion ) was installed in the e . u countries . total wind power capacity in the region grew 33 % to 23 , 056 mw . the united states added 410 mw ( a 10 % increase ) , and canada about 40 mw . spain now generates more wind power than the united states . the countries with most wind power capacity are germany - by far the largest , with just over 12 , 000 mw - followed by spain , the united states , denmark , and india . summary when most people think of windmills , they probably think of holland and tulips . we ' re willing to bet that most people do not realize that the architectural company that won the right to design the new world trade center in new york , envisions powering part of the building using this very technology . fnpr has bought the rights to inventor alvin snaper ' s propless wind power generator - in other words , a windmill with no propellers . snaper , who among other things , invented the ibm selectric typewriter ball , as well as , tang , orange flavored drink , for general foods will head up fnpr ' s green power generation technical advisory team . this technology breakthrough will allow fnpr to enter a huge multi - billion dollar untapped electricity market , by turning commercial and residential high - rise buildings into self - generating energy systems with the capacity to sell surplus power back onto the grid . this market is currently inaccessible to propeller driven turbines . fnpr is new to the market , creating a unique business model , and looking to grow rapidly . according to the ceo , look for exciting new development ' s in the near future , ?

2	Subject: lay it on the line survey results recently , i asked you to " lay it on the line " and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address . many of you responded , and i want to share the survey results with you . additionally , i want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move enron forward . first , let ' s take a look at the survey results . in just three days , more than 4 , 000 employees completed the survey . i sincerely appreciate your participation . i . we asked you to identify the top five issues facing enron today . the responses were : 1 . stock price 2 . the prc 3 . employee / internal morale 4 . external reputation and image 5 . " walking the talk " of integrity and respect ii . we asked you general questions about working at enron , comparing 2001 to 2000 . % of employees responding strongly agree / agree : i am committed to staying at enron . 64 . 1 % enron is a company i would invest my money in . 60 . 1 % i am treated with respect . 60 . 0 % i would recommend enron as a place to work for friends and family . 59 . 1 % i have talents and skills that enron is not fully utilizing . 54 . 7 % enron truly encourages people to take risks . 47 . 5 % my immediate supervisor has a clear view of where enron is going and how to get there . 46 . 6 % executive management has a clear view of where enron is going and how to get there . 41 . 6 % iii . we asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to enron , comparing 2001 to 2000 . more same less n / a concerned for communities 34 . 5 % 44 . 9 % 10 . 3 % 10 . 3 % innovative 30 . 8 % 35 . 7 % 24 . 6 % 8 . 9 % entrepreneurial 28 . 5 % 37 . 8 % 23 . 7 % 10 . 0 % ethical 17 . 0 % 45 . 1 % 28 . 1 % 9 . 8 % trustworthy 14 . 9 % 39 . 0 % 36 . 9 % 9 . 2 % arrogant 39 . 1 % 32 . 4 % 13 . 3 % 15 . 2 % self - serving 41 . 9 % 38 . 6 % 7 . 5 % 12 . 0 % iv . finally , we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at enron . 1 . people ( the high quality of people at enron was the most widely - cited aspect ) : - - - talented - - - creative - - - learn from one another 2 . culture and reputation : - - - innovative spirit - - - willingness to be aggressive and take risks - - - ability to embrace change - - - involvement in community 3 . work environment : - - - pay and benefits - - - true meritocracy - - - unlimited opportunities the results of our survey confirmed for the management committee and me the great things you feel about enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move enron forward . the following are some of the things we ' re doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified . keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback . now , here ' s what we ' re going to do based on your feedback . stock price we are all concerned about our stock price , which has declined significantly this year . the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include : - - - a decline in the overall market and economy ; - - - certain enron - specific issues , such as california , india and recent management turnover ; - - - a " meltdown " in the broadband sector , which may have been as much as $ 30 - $ 40 of our stock price at the high ; - - - lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter ' s high ; and - - - concerns over the pace of energy deregulation . these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution , wholesale and retail businesses . very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth , and future earnings growth , as has enron . we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors , our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve . - - - over the past month , we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts , reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses . - - - we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money . we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward : - - - mark koenig , executive vice president of investor relations , will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions . he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions . - - - greg whalley , mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees , which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide . watch for these events . the prc the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy . understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors , which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership , and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives . nevertheless , we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern , and we believe we can improve , refine , streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone . therefore , we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to year - end : - - - effective immediately , relative performance discussions will occur annually at year - end . however , business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently . - - - the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron . business units will be asked to identify only their top 10 % and bottom 10 % performers for review by enron ' s office of the chairman annually at year - end . - - - we will continue to use the pep 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees . we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year . - - - finally , we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes . in the november issue of enron business , we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process . in addition , there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year - end . employee morale we believe the stock price , our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale . additionally , some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns . effective immediately , we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources ( hr ) rep . - - - we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations ( er ) that will report directly to the office of the chairman . cindy olson will head this function . more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days . over the long term , we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles . - - - we will encourage vice presidents and above , as well as other current and emerging leaders , to complete executive impact & influence training . these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people . - - - additionally , we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate ! , which will be rolled out immediately . communicate ! is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video , voice mails , e - mails and meetings notes , to analyze user performance based on a participant ' s responses and actions . external reputation we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year . the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees . we recognize that as enron ' s ambassador ' s in the marketplace , the more you know about our strategy , performance and challenges , the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company . to ensure you are better informed : - - - we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron . in addition to our existing communication efforts , like e - mail messages and internal publications ebiz and enron business , we will post a q & a on current issues on the enron intranet at home . enron . com . this will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers . - - - as we said before , greg , mark and i , as well as members of our management committee , will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges . look for these to start in mid - october . integrity & respect i believe , as i said previously , we need to reinforce our core values , particularly integrity and respect . from what you have told us in this survey , you agree . - - - enron ' s values will have more importance in each employee ' s evaluation and feedback . we ask that all employees , regardless of level , hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis . we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers . - - - we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional , specific feedback on employee issues like ethics , integrity and individual concerns . if you would like to participate in these focus groups , please send an e - mail to cindy olson . - - - periodically , i will host a special feature column in enron business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results . finally , i give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding enron ' s strategy and challenges , and listening to your concerns and ideas . but we would ask for your commitment , too . we need your dedication to enron and its values , as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long - term success . we will conduct another employee survey early next year . please continue to send me your feedback and let ' s continue to work together and keep enron one of the best places to work in the world .

2	Subject: california update 2 / 12 executive summary : the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60 % . this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below , but also because the 30 - day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week , increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . 1 . utilities vs . cpuc governor davis ' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed . the case will come before the judge on monday , february 12 th . the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities . however , the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ( $ . 01 / kwh ) . this will be left to an appellate court . the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing , by the smaller ipps ( as noted in our reports last week ) or by larger out - of - state generators such as duke , reliant , and dynegy ( as noted in the press this morning ) . this is expected next week or the week after . 2 . prospects for a bailout bill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support . senator burton , despite his public refusals , is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail - out . the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position . they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear . for burton , this is because of his long association with labor unions ; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy . burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him . the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for : bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state , but with some kind of state support ( but less than " full faith and credit of the state of ca , " which would not pass ) . this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills ( e . g . $ . 01 , though the actual amount is not known ) . these bonds would be asset - backed securities , with payment receivable from rate payers . the term of these bonds is unknown ; if the term is made quite long ( e . g . 20 years ) , the associated rate increase could be very small . the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets for a very high price . the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , sources believe that this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . as noted in an earlier report , the california legislature habitually does not act until things " hit the wall . " it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton ' s lead and support the bail - out plan . the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature . one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail - out in her central valley district is " 50 to 1 . " however , an involuntary filing ( or the threat thereof ) may be enough to trigger legislative support . it would allow the argument of an " imminent threat " to the people of the state of california . 3 . consumer opposition harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum . if the referendum fails , he intends to attack individual legislators ( though not john burton , who reportedly has " immunity " from rosenfield ) . some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail - out plan , then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later . however , if the bail - out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill ( rather than put in place by the puc , for example ) , it cannot be reversed by a referendum . as additional insurance against rosenfield , by supporting the bonds issued under the plan , the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan . while it is not clear that this is a factual argument , it still might impede any referendum .

2	Subject: fw : onondaga louise / dave : we have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding onondaga as i mentioned in our meeting yesterday . for whatever reason , our interest in onondaga ( through the cash flow interest agreement ) is viewed by accounting as a receivable . from a commercial standpoint , this is incorrect , but at the end of the day , it doesn ' t really matter . billy ' s e - mail below basically states that because of how the onondaga interest has been classified , we should reduce the $ 7 . 9 million by the $ 1 . 1 million payment received last week , but then readjust the value of the asset . based on our internal valuation , and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser , adjusting the value of the " receivable " to $ 10 million ( after application of the $ 1 . 1 million payment received ) would be very conservative . this would net a gain of $ 3 . 1 million for q 3 . with your concurrence , i will work with billy to support the adjustment of onondaga to $ 10 million ( and therefore the gain of $ 3 . 1 million ) . i will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise . please let me know if you have any questions . regards , ben - - - - - original message - - - - - from : fleenor , william sent : wednesday , september 19 , 2001 5 : 57 pm to : jacoby , ben subject : re : onondaga ben , based upon the review of the cashflow interest agreement , partnership agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income . the basis that is carried on our books currently ( approx . $ 7 . 9 mm ) represents a long - term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ena and oclp . in addition , this asset does not qualify for the mtm or fair value accounting models . the payment received from oclp based on the cashflow interest agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books . however , it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce / write - off $ 8 million of this long - term receivable based upon the best information available at the time . as stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been . this would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible . this will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year . this basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as mtm . a few things need to be noted : 1 ) support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset . please provide this to me 2 ) you will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset . supposedly corp took the write down . . . . may cause problems . 3 ) somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create . it is my understanding that rac and credit are not involved . 4 ) we need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year . we will probably get questioned by aa . please call me if you would like to discuss . regards , billy - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jacoby , ben sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 9 : 37 pm to : fleenor , william ; vos , theresa subject : onondaga please book the payment received from onondaga as q 3 income . in this morning ' s meeting with louise , i have advised her that our internal valuation and sales efforts support this payment being taken as income . please advise as i need to update her tomorrow . thanks much . ben

2	Subject: ft . pierce ozzie : as a follow up to our phone conversation , how about scheduling the ft . pierce project review meeting during the second week in april ? the objective of the meeting is to look at the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking . the intended outcome is to ensure all related enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions . this will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on " technical risks " as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments . we had a similar meeting with the electrobolt team in enron s . america , that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives . do you have a project presentation that you ( and / or the lead developer ) could discuss with the above team ? as many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well ( e . g . , commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy ) . one of the key aspects of the project to discuss is the schedule risk and our strategy for securing a capable construction contractor for the job . let me know as to your availability , and who else you think should attend the meeting . thanks , brian

debt ratings an issue by wall street journal staff reporters john r . emshwiller and rebecca smith in los angeles and robin sidel and jonathan weil in new york 11 / 09 / 2001 the wall street journal a 3 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $ 586 million , or 20 % , mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers . the disclosure , contained in a securities and exchange commission filing , came even as the houston energy - trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies . the total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 . on the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases . in yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion . the filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment . the sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation . the sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades . ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . " it ' s bad , " he said . the enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments " the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , " yesterday ' s sec filing said . an andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement " an unfortunate situation " but said the accounting firm is " cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . " he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns . among the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael kopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp . as reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers . in 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron . by having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said . mr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed . enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million . ljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed . several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said " it is possible " that continuing enron reviews will " identify additional or different information concerning these matters . " as such , " there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , " said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis . the enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships . - - - mea culpa in the midst of talks to be acquired by dynegy , enron details accounting and other actions . - - will restate its financial results from 1997 through the third quarter of 2001 , reducing previously reported income by $ 586 million and boosting previously reported debt to $ 628 million at the end of 2000 - - concedes three entities run by company officials should have been included in its consolidated financial statements , based on generally accepted accounting principles - - fires ben glisan , managing director and treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , managing director and general counsel of an enron division - - establishes a special committee to review all transactions source : the company copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c does enron trust its new numbers ? it doesn ' t act like it by floyd norris 11 / 09 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company you ' d be better informed if , instead of listening to what we say , you watch what we do . ' ' that excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general . enron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery . but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules . in january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made . remarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ? the answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term . what set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad . but that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are . in fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron . such games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers . graph shows enron share prices since oct . 15 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c surest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron by neela banerjee 11 / 09 / 2001 the new york times page 5 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company the tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare . until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators . enron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting . dynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor . as one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' ' kenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s . when electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast . dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry . mr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' ' if enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet . ' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst . because enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now . ' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work .

' ' if not for the dire condition of enron today , we are not certain an enron - dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital . ' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' ' it was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston . mr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' ' enron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million . the changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow . the remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions . ' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' ' while the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors . mr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said . enron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss . in a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement . but enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year . enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two . some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company . yesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy . enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion . photo : dynegy ' s chief executive , charles l . watson , is respected among stock analysts .

" neither plans additional comments until a deal is struck or the talks fail . the statements came as enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created , including several being investigated by federal securities regulators . enron has been under heavy fire since oct . 16 , when it released third - quarter earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships formerly run by its since - replaced chief financial officer . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , is to meet with top dynegy executives today . she has a number of questions about a possible merger , including why dynegy wants to buy enron when its best resource , its people , could cross the street and turn in r ? sum ? s . she also wonders why ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price . " what does he know that we don ' t know ? " coale asked . but coale also got the sense dynegy executives are doing their homework and moving with caution , which she said is positive . a dynegy buyout of enron has the potential to be " highly accretive " to dynegy ' s bottom line depending on the price paid , said ronald barone , an analyst at ubs warburg in new york . " the new company would be a global powerhouse , " he said . " there are significant synergies that can be realized to enhance value . " shares in dynegy closed up $ 3 . 50 thursday to $ 36 . 50 . investors liked two opposite prospects , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & co . international in houston . on the one hand , investors see potential for dynegy to add profits by buying enron , he said . but if no deal happens , they also see a chance for dynegy to take business away from a weakened enron . he expects any deal dynegy signs to give it an escape if the securities and exchange commission should conclude enron acted illegally . government regulators would have to review a merger , looking to see if too much market concentration would result . with a merger , dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the north american natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent , said john olson , an analyst with sanders harris morris in houston . for electricity , dynegy ' s numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 percent , he said . andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities in new york , doesn ' t believe regulators would find a market concentration problem . " it ' s a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition , " he said . meade called an enron - dynegy merger " a mixed bag , " as it would let dynegy cut costs and lead the energy trading market . " however , i don ' t think it ' s as easy as it sounds , " he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron ' s traders to work for the new company .

" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information . the futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out . by putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels . by some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default . that still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s " counterparties " ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection . what has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved . why should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ?

" what we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn ' t in the 1990 s . . . so maybe if the companies that don ' t give shareholder rights gave them , their stock would do a lot better going forward , " he said .

" the valuation problem is complicated by enron ' s gigantic market share , far larger than the largest institutions have in the government bond , currency , or exchange traded commodities markets . even so , it is likely that enron ' s long and short positions do balance , as the company says , even though the revenue recognition and profitability may need tuning . the company ' s earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassuring , in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income statement in the trading business . dynegy ' s due diligence team and the arthur anderson auditors working on enron ' s books know they had better get it right . if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern . that means keeping the trading business going , although probably running it more carefully and transparently . also , this is probably a " once in a corporate lifetime " opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators . there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets . the fed ' s giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low - cost way to head off any problem . and enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call . so enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .

" the potential is staggering . if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21 bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing skills and financial resources , " says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group . dynegy ' s gas business is currently less than half the size of enron ' s , and also trails duke and mirant . it is only one - eighth as big as enron in power trading , where aep , mirant , duke , el paso and reliant also hold big positions . like enron , dynegy has been a market favourite , exploiting growth opportunities in the unregulated and rapidly developing wholesale natural gas and electricity markets in the us . it has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence . dynegy ' s online trading platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company ' s recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online . the two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale gas liquids at the click of a mouse . there are other links . chuck watson , dynegy chief executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as enron chief executive officer in august . dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses . that counterparty relationship may give dynegy a powerful incentive to preserve enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets . analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens . however , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies . some analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail - out for the trading industry , and therefore welcomed by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission . others , however , raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by dynegy . although dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitions or mergers in the us and overseas , they had not expected such a transforming deal . mr watson told analysts in october that he was considering deals which could add generation assets , gas pipeline and storage infrastructure , entire utilities and communication assets . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , says there would be other concerns surrounding any deal with enron . " strategically and culturally , the companies do not fit well together , " she says , adding that enron has been moving to offload units while dynegy has preferred to hang on to assets . carol levenson at gimme credit . com , an independent provider of credit research , says dynegy would be taking " a big risk " to its credit ratings by even being associated with enron ' s liabilities : " dynegy is utterly dependent on its credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners to do business profitably . " analysts took some comfort , however , in the possible involvement of the newly merged chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 per cent stake in dynegy . additional reporting by andrew edgecliffe - johnson . ( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved . http : / / www . ft . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector . the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron , a liquidity crisis would probably ensue , disrupting energy markets and undermining business for many of its competitors . " there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink , " says christine uspenski , energy analyst at schwab capital markets . so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 , when enron disclosed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that brought to the fore long - simmering questions about its transparency . analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 . many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances . " it became a new age holding company , " says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . " as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . " those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers . they would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under . but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past . analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . " no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , " one energy trader said yesterday . even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer . however , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly . enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . " out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , " says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .

" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec ( securities and exchange commission ) about these matters , " said ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , yesterday , adding that the group would continue to respond to investors ' requests for information . the group ' s banks , due to meet today , want to secure $ 3 . 3 bn in unsecured credit lines drawn down in the past month . but they may not be able to renegotiate the terms unless enron ' s situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default . jp morgan chase and citigroup , which have made $ 1 bn in secured loans to enron , are also understood to want to syndicate them to spread the risk , as nervousness increases . in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and changes in net income up to the third quarter of this year . enron ' s stock fell a further 5 per cent in morning trading - to $ 8 . 61 - and stands at barely a tenth of its level at the end of last year . the group ' s bonds rose only 4 points to 78 cents in the dollar reflecting scepticism about a rescue deal with dynegy . lex , page 22 enron in crisis , page 27 .

" dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power , " said raymond plank , chairman of apache corp . , a houston natural gas producer . " we don ' t see any advantage to that . " if the dynegy deal is approved , the purchase price would come to just over $ 10 per share , based on current market values . in august 2000 , enron ' s stock hit $ 90 a share , but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 , down 64 cents . enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades , quoting prices and buying and selling commodities . while some of these transactions set the price of oil , natural gas , electricity other energy products , far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices , or companies seeking insurance to limit the costs of energy purchases . energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail . " the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now , " said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . plank said traders " have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] . " not everyone has been able to do it . " but plank said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks . " markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas , power and oil " if enron had to pull back from trading , gagliardi said . " but we ' d get back to normal pretty quickly . " bond - rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on enron ' s bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above junk status , by some ratings . analysts said that if enron ' s bond rating fell below investment grade , they expect it to set in motion a forced sale of enron assets held by the partnerships . two of the partnerships , named marlin and osprey , have a combined indebtedness of $ 3 . 4 billion , said ralph pellechia , an analyst at fitch inc . , a bond - rating firm . that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings . if enron ' s bond rating crashes , the assets presumably would be sold and enron would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by delivering its stock to the partnerships , pellechia said . given the drop in enron ' s stock price , that might not be possible . " we don ' t believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt , " he said . " obviously there are a lot of options they [ enron officials ] are exploring . we are watching it very closely . " http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones in return , enron took a note receivable , or simply a loan , from raptor for $ 1 . 2 billion . as it happened , enron benefited massively from the assets hedge . it protected itself against a $ 500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $ 453 million in 2001 . these hedging gains were netted out to zero in enron core earnings , because they were offset by declines in asset values . but without the hedges , enron would ' ve taken the losses in its expense line . vince carter of course , the problem was that raptor , and therefore ljm 2 , was losing from the hedges . that might ' ve been tolerable if raptor were making money from the stock agreement . but enron ' s stock began falling sharply in 2001 , depriving ljm 2 of potential profits . meanwhile , as the stock price slid , enron was having to agree to issue more stock to keep the equity pledge to raptor at $ 1 . 2 billion . as the decline continued into the third quarter , and the issuance commitment grew , it made sense to unwind all the raptor deals with ljm 2 . at this point , enron took the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity in the third quarter to reverse the equity pledge . enron did take some of raptor ' s hedging losses itself , but it did so through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter . the big question is whether ljm 2 actually took any losses itself from raptor . why is that crucial ? if enron shielded ljm 2 from losses , it was essentially dealing with itself . the sec and investors wouldn ' t like that . what clues are there that ljm 2 didn ' t take a loss ? well , the thursday press release says that enron bought out ljm 2 ' s stakes in raptor for $ 35 million . that makes little sense . how can ljm 2 have had any raptor equity left after the losses it appears to have sustained ? if enron made ljm 2 whole , then this was all little more than a shell game . seems like enron still has a whole lot more to tell us . world stock markets - wall st surges as europe takes lead from fed americas . by mary chung . 11 / 09 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved us stocks surged in morning trade after the bank of england and the european central bank followed the federal reserve ' s lead and lowered interest rates . by midsession , the dow jones industrial average rose above its pre - attack level , up 127 . 18 to 9 , 681 . 55 while the s & p 500 index gained 16 . 24 at 1 , 132 . 04 . the nasdaq composite rose 41 . 23 to 1 , 878 . 76 . investors cheered as the eurozone and uk central banks both surprised markets with aggressive half - point cuts in interest rates to help revive slumping global economies . they were also heartened by the latest unemployment data , which showed a decline in the number of americans filing for first - time jobless claims last week . markets rallied broadly with technology stocks taking the lead . sun microsystem gained 9 per cent at $ 13 . 72 and cisco systems added 3 . 6 per cent at $ 19 . 61 . semiconductor stocks were boosted by an upbeat global sales forecast from an industry trade group . intel , the world ' s biggest chipmaker , added 3 per cent at $ 29 . 19 . xo communications was up 14 per cent at $ 1 . 33 after the company reported a smaller - than - expected third quarter loss . dynergy rose 12 per cent at $ 37 after the energy group confirmed that it is in talks to acquire enron , the embattled energy trading company . shares in enron dipped 0 . 7 per cent at $ 8 . 99 . retail stocks were mostly higher with dow components wal - mart up 3 per cent at $ 55 . 36 and home depot 4 per cent at $ 43 . 49 . wal - mart reported higher same - store sales last month . anntaylor was up 7 per cent at $ 26 . 18 and talbots 5 per cent at $ 32 . 60 in spite of the companies reporting a declines in october same - store sales . barnes & noble , however , plunged 27 per cent at $ 27 . 75 after the bookstore company warned that full - year earnings would fail to meet previous wall street forecasts because of weaker - than - expected sales . financials were stronger with citigroup up 2 . 5 per cent at $ 49 . 31 and american express 4 . 8 per cent at $ 35 . 50 . other bright spots on the dow included walt disney up 3 . 5 per cent at $ 19 . 13 and alcoa 2 . 3 per cent at $ 35 . 17 . coca - cola , mcdonalds and hewlett - packard were the few stocks moving lower . hp dipped 1 . 6 per cent at $ 18 . 87 amid mounting pressure from hewlett and packard family members to cancel its merger plans with compaq computer . toronto was led upwards by technology issues in morning trade . by midsession the s & p tse 300 index had gained 0 . 7 per cent to 7 , 199 . 50 . the tech - heavy industrial products sector rose 2 per cent .

" this would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced , " ellinghaus added . enron shares fell 64 cents thursday to close at $ 8 . 41 , its lowest finish since 1992 and less than 10 % of the nearly $ 90 high the company hit aug . 23 , 2000 . dynegy shares rose $ 3 . 50 to $ 36 . 50 . both trade on the new york stock exchange . . analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books . although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets , the deals are almost always with third parties and private investors rather than company executives . the involvement of executives as investors in these ventures raises the perception of a conflict of interest , said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis . the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships , which were approved by enron lawyers and directors . in essence , the partnerships reduced borrowings enron listed on its balance sheet . they protected its credit rating , helping it to obtain favorable interest rates on its corporate borrowings . however , after reviewing its accounting for three of the ventures , enron said in an sec filing thursday that it should have included the financial performance of those businesses in its consolidated balance sheet . the filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents " should not be relied upon . " enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . the biggest change was a $ 250 - million reduction in net income for 1999 . the enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share , or about $ 8 billion , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front , with $ 1 billion to follow at the close of the transaction . dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , which does not include the off - balance - sheet partnerships , the sources said . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities , the sources said . dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company , and dynegy president stephen bergstrom would become president , they said . there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached , and if it is , such a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators . the potential merger would have its problems , some analysts said . dynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset , its energy traders , who can easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the houston area , said andre meade , head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities . dynegy , like enron , needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell assets and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses , said carol levenson , an analyst with gimmecredit . com . a thumbs - down by the stock market could seriously jeopardize dynegy ' s financial flexibility , she said . although enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy trading and marketing business remains sound , the company ' s severe cash crunch has hurt . enron ' s online trading operation has lost business in recent days . graphic : enron rescuer ?

2000 dow jones source : world reporter ( tm ) enron , the debt - stricken energy trading group , could be forced to sell its main british assets under the terms of an $ 8 bn takeover being considered by dynegy , its smaller rival . the two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeover , which would see houston firm dynegy , about a fifth of the size of its target , pay a " fire - sale " price worth about a tenth of enron ' s $ 70 bn value a year ago . the outcome would be a humiliation for enron , amer ica ' s largest energy trader , which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the republican party and the presidential campaign last year . it has been forlornly courting cash injections from groups such as shell in the past few days to keep it afloat . enron ' s shares have lost 90 % of their value this year , going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director andrew fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off - balance sheet . these forced it to take a $ 1 bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn . two other senior officials , including enron ' s treasurer , were fired yesterday following their involvement in the murky fastow deals , which are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission . pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today between enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four years , amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status . chevrontexaco , the oil group which owns 27 % of dynegy , would inject up to $ 2 . 5 bn if the deal goes ahead . enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which it paid pounds 1 . 4 bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in britain , including the high - performing 1900 mw teesside plant . it recently announced deals to run the energy management operations of sainsbury and guinness . dynegy is paying pounds 421 m for bg ' s gas storage business , a deal expected to be concluded next month , but , renowned for its " stingy " financial management , it has shied away from buying a series of british power stations on offer because of inflated prices . copyright ? 2000 dow jones at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , $ 628 million more than previously reported . by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets . and while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew . investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications . however , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace . enron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india . then , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity . several news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart . besides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group . on thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details . the new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported . enron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported . enron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could " appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . " " we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , " said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive the company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when . wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility . still , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to " why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron . " christopher ellinghaus of williams capital in new york said enron ' s accounting " shenanigans " are legendary in the industry . " i ' m not willing to say it ' s fraud yet , " ellinghaus said . " enron just likes to be fancy . they may have been too fancy for their own good . " enron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net income of about $ 96 million in 1997 , $ 113 million in 1998 , $ 250 million in 1999 and $ 132 million in 2000 , increases of $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $ 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 . enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com http : / / www . dynegy . com ap graphic enron restatements and ap photo ny 882 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . report on business column taking stock beware the company that does not tell all brian milner 11 / 09 / 2001 the globe and mail metro b 9 " all material copyright ( c ) bell globemedia publishing inc . and its licensors . all rights reserved . " before its stunning fall from grace , enron corp . was a genuine market darling , with a throng of adoring investors , analysts and academics who held it out as a model of how to turn a sleepy , old economy company into a true star of the fast - paced new economy . even after the puncturing of the market bubble , the critics who had long questioned the texas company ' s aggressive growth strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old - fashioned cranks . now , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron ' s reputation is in tatters , the u . s . securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast . about the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in investing and long espoused by the likes of warren buffett : never buy anything you don ' t understand and don ' t touch a company whose finances are so murky as to defy description . there ' s no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less investors know about their true financial state , the better . the dot - bomb rubble is littered with them . they include nortel networks , cisco systems , lucent technologies , amazon . com , jds uniphase , qwest communications , motorola , volkswagen and even starbucks . in these bearish times , most companies acknowledge , albeit reluctantly , that they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested interest in their future . here is what joe nacchio , defiant boss of troubled qwest , told a conference last month : " you all think we cheat and lie and steal , obviously , and therefore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue and great growth should be traded . . . . we ' ll just let the numbers speak for themselves on oct . 31 . " so along comes that fateful day , and we pass the mike over to mr . nacchio : " some of you will recall that at a recent conference i said the results will speak for themselves . the reality is they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges . " you can guess what happened to qwest ' s credibility and its stock price . as for houston - based enron , which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to shore up its vast energy - trading business and keep its credit rating from being slashed below investment grade , the company confirmed yesterday it ' s in talks with smaller cross - town rival dynegy . several published accounts have said the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $ 2 - billion and an eventual merger . faced with the sec probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits , enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren ' t worth anything . the company is restating earnings through the first half of this year , mainly to reflect a $ 1 . 2 - billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse . such transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself . disclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since . opaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations . but investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . city - enron crisis deepens as two top staff are fired . by roland gribben . 11 / 09 / 2001 the daily telegraph p 36 ( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001 the crisis surrounding enron , the beleaguered american energy trading group with power plant and trading investments in britain , deepened yesterday with the dismissal of two key executives alleged to be involved in off - balance - sheet operations now under investigation by regulatory authorities . ben glisan , managing director and treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , another managing director and lawyer of a subsidiary business , left after internal investigations . enron said it believed the pair and four other former enron employeers were involved as partners in a limited partnership that had dealings with the company . the dismissals came as enron considered a " make or break " takeover offer from dynergy , another us energy group with uk interests . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dabhol pwr mtg focus on tata , bses to acquire enron stake 11 / 09 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 65 - 415 - 4066 ; sri . jegarajah @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 ) 2001 - 11 - 09 02 : 31 ( new york ) enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 ) ( adds lender ' s comments in ninth paragraph , detail on idbi ' s exposure to enron in 11 th . ) singapore , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the world ' s largest energy trader , is meeting lenders about its sale of a stake in a $ 3 billion indian power project as it seeks to raise cash and forestall a possible credit downgrade . enron , which lost 89 percent of its market value this year , had its long - term credit rating cut as low as one notch above junk status this week and would have to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds early if its rating is cut below investment grade . dynegy inc . , which is in talks to buy enron for about $ 8 billion in stock , is concerned about a downgrade after enron yesterday restated its earnings for more than four years to include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior executives , people familiar with the situation said . ` ` restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of fraud , which in itself is justification for a downgrade , ' ' said donald coxe , who manages 78 , 000 enron shares as part of the harris insight equity fund . ` ` i ' d be surprised if they ' re not downgraded .

( end videotape ) katayama : now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal . dynegy will have to recalculate enron ` s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , it may not be the last of those restatements . that ` s because , in this current case , today ` s disclosure concerned only three entities . enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships . ali . velshi : fred , tell me about these partnerships . is this common ? katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company . velshi : let ` s talk about enron stock . this used to be a darling stock . it ` s trading $ 1 . 40 off its 52 - week low . in fact at this moment , it ` s one tenth of its 52 - week high . katayama : right . you know , that stock used to be as you say , a darling of wall street . it traded almost like a tech stock . because here was this pipeline company in texas that all of a sudden was into fiber optics , was into broadband and it traded like a tech stock . it also fell like a tech stock . that stock is down 73 percent over the last month , down 89 percent year to date and was down 10 days in a row in october . velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours , that became discussions on a merger and a partnership . i don ` t want to use the word partnership . tell me what ` s likely to happen there . katayama : well , the thing is , wall street was really anticipating , based on yesterday ` s build up , that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , that dynegy would buy enron , possibly for 7 , 8 billion . but a lot of analysts say one , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it . velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back . katayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ? traders , human capital . and in times of uncertainty , human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies . velshi : fred , thanks very much for being with us . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron shareholder derivative suit filed 11 / 08 / 2001 pr newswire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire ) chicago , nov . 8 / prnewswire / - - the following statement was issued by krislov & associates , ltd : two shareholders of enron have filed a derivative suit in federal court in texas alleging that certain directors of enron breached their fiduciary duties to the company . the plaintiffs are represented by clinton krislov , michael karnuth , and michael rosenblat , of krislov & associates , chicago , illinois and michael bradford , of benckenstein & oxford , baumont , texas . the suit was filed on behalf of enron , to redress damages to the company from enron ' s investments in limited partnerships which were controlled by andrew fastow , enron ' s then chief financial officer , and approved by enron ' s board of directors . these transactions resulted in losses to enron estimated to be at least $ 35 million and a reduction in shareholders ' equity of at least $ 1 . 2 billion . the suit alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and due care that they owed to enron and its stockholders . attorney krislov was quoted : " they took a great company and nearly destroyed it through financial manipulation . maybe we can get some of it back for the company and its shareholders .

2	Subject: buy - back strategy group , this is an email i sent to our generators regarding decing and buy - back strategies . please read so you know what ' s going , and can take the lead on implementing these strategies . we ' ll let you know when all the generators on board . thanks , stan due to the relatively weak real - time market during morning hours , we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec . bidding or buying - back generation that you ' ve sold forward . we want to stress that this is a relatively short - term strategy . as the weather turns cold during the late - autumn and winter months , the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real - time market . lately , hel - 10 have been very weak real - time , ranging between $ 25 and $ 40 . we have two strategies that we would like to suggest : 1 . decremental supplemental bids we can submit dec . bids to the iso at a price below your cost to generate . basically , we would be letting the iso know that we ' re willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw ' s from the iso to cover the prescheduled quantity . you are still paid the day - ahead price for the day - ahead quantity , but instead of generating it , you would be buying it from the iso . for example , if your cost to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10 / mwh . if the iso takes the decremental bid , and the price is $ 30 , then you make $ 20 / mwh . advantages - a relatively large upside , the price the iso charges could actually go negative , as large as negative $ 91 . 87 . also , you would actually be buying from the iso , as opposed to selling to the iso and being subject to credit risk . disadvantages - ten minute dispatch . when we submit decremental bids , the iso has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes . in addition to the physical problems this might create , the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow . 2 . buying - back blocks in the bi - lateral market : this strategy calls for our real - time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi - lateral market for below your cost to generate . this would call for you to reduce your generation , and the energy we buy - back in the real - time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity . once again , you are still paid the day - ahead price for the day - ahead quantity , but instead of generating it , you would be buying it at the price paid to buy - back the energy . as in the previous example , if your cost to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10 / mwh . if we can buy - back the energy for a price of $ 30 , then you make $ 20 / mwh . additionally , if we do buy - back the energy , we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the iso to remain compliant with the ferc order . then , if the iso takes the incremental bid , you can generate the power and sell for additional profit . advantages - no 10 minute dispatch ( unless a supplemental bid is accepted ) . you would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced . also , the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage . disadvantage - not as large of an up - side as decremental bidding . at this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy # 2 , buying - back blocks of energy in the bi - lateral market . once you and our real - time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy , then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the iso . we propose a 50 / 50 profit split , above your day - ahead profit , earned from either of these two strategies . if you have any questions or comments please call myself or chris foster . stan cocke the services desk 503 - 464 - 3829

2	Subject: alliance announces another delay until november 13 alliance deliveries delayed until nov . 13 in a move that is likely to send ripples through the market , particularly around chicago , the 1 . 325 bcf / d alliance pipeline extended its commercial in - service delay last week to nov . 13 from oct . 30 . pipeline officials said moisture and debris in the line caused the delay . " as we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system commissioning , we have encountered moisture and debris from construction , " said ceo norm gish . " specifically , most of the debris is in the form of small pieces of foam from the [ smart ] pigs that were used to remove the hydrostatic testing water from the line . the problem forced us to shut down the system for short periods of time to clean out accumulated debris . " we have since designed and installed additional in - line screens at our compressor stations . the situation is improving and we are removing ever - decreasing amounts of debris with increased flows of test gas . however , this situation has not permitted us to run our system with the significant volumes necessary to adequately test the reliability of our compressors . " it is the second time alliance has had to delay its in - service date . in early september , alliance officials said rain in saskatchewan this summer , directional drilling problems at a creek in british columbia , complex connection problems with the aux sable liquids plant in illinois and connection delays with several u . s . pipelines and ldcs was to blame for a one - month delay to oct . 30 ( see daily gpi , sept . 11 ) . the pipeline will continue increasing test volumes until it begins commercial service , said gish . there currently is about 500 mmcf / d of test gas in the line . he expects firm delivery capacity to reach the full 1 . 325 bcf / d prior to nov . 13 . alliance officials also noted that this is the first time a pipeline the size of alliance has been brought on stream at one time . regardless of the challenge , however , market participants were expecting the system to be delivering gas starting at the beginning of the month of november and this delay is likely to have a significant impact on november bidweek trading . one chicago trader said he had a strong suspicion something was fishy when his index offers were lifted friday afternoon by a marketing company , which he knows to own capacity on the pipe . " everyone was a buyer of index gas today for november , especially those now short for the first 13 days . i sold mine at ngi plus 1 . 5 , but had i known that alliance was delayed i would have held out for something a little better . " basis , meanwhile , was pretty much unchanged at + 13 to + 14 for november . " it takes a lot to move the chicago basis , " he said .

2	Subject: fw : rto week - - state commissioners fyi . tj and claudette - - please send to your groups . thanks - - - - - original message - - - - - from : landwehr , susan m . sent : thursday , october 18 , 2001 6 : 19 pm thursday morning session - - - - meeting with state commissioners this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process . although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend , upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame . it was a long morning ! i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts . approximately 35 to 40 % of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts . most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support . everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc , primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process , that ferc was moving too quickly , and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens . in particular , the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric . while many would think that the session was extremely negative ( our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting ! ) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing - - allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis . here ' s some individual comments : catherine riley / maryland - - - she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens ( she was way overboard in the dramatics department ) . she then stated that she was not at the meeting to " help you ( ferc ) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record " . it went on like this for about 15 minutes . the good part is that she was so personally negative , that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her . sam ervin / north carolina - - - he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens , that customer choice is never coming to his state , so he will never benefit from an rto , that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto ( and i bet if they do , he ' ll work to change the statutes ! ) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc . his comments were also pretty brutal , but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor . arnetta mcrae / delware - - - she kept on saying " show me " where the benefits for consumers are . she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order . rory mcminn / new mexico - - - repeatedly talked about how the west was different , how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers , how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were . carl wood / california - - tried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole , and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments . he delivered the same messages that we ' ve been hearing forever - - - ferc should have acted sooner on price caps , etc etc . glen thomas / pennsylvania - - - he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it ' s energy system into the new century . . . that by opening it ' s markets they have had an explosion in green power , they have reduced costs all across the state , etc . he was very supportive of pjm ( makes sense because it ' s in his back yard ) and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance . judy jones / ohio - - - was very parochial in her discussion , but echoed don svanda ' s comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed . ed garvey / minnesota - - - he got the gold star for the day . after very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners , he took about 1 minute and said " ferc - - just get it done " . . . . in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward . other commissioners who talked were : arthur / connecticut , hadley / indiana , huelsman / kentucky , nugent / maine all on the positive side . other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do . from the ferc commissioner standpoint , the gold star went to massey . after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn ' t feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough , he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back , saying the " there has been 7 years of process , and he wants a process that comes to an end . . . . you ' ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree . . .

cera alert cera alert : sent fri , september 15 , 2000 title : cera monthly briefing : supply anxiety author : n . american natural gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u  5526 & m  1357 , alternative url : as the heating season approaches , a high  * but justified  * level of anxiety regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market . as things stand , the market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions . this prospect has placed a floor on the gas price at the price of residual fuel oil , itself priced in the mid - to upper $ 4 . 00 s range . gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market , diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again . to the upside , there is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil , as of this writing near $ 7 . 00 per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) , is breached . however , distillate markets themselves are extremely tight , and prices for that fuel would likely follow gas prices up . within this range , prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety  * the market  , s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall , which would be characterized by extreme pricing and volatility , and a difficult process of supply allocation by price . by now , exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain . although cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2 . 0 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day from august to september , this increase would still leave inventories at record lows for this month and next . even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms , or if hot weather returns . for october , heating load enters the picture . with us supplies running close to year - earlier levels and imports slightly higher , demand priced out of the market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from last year  , s low level . as a result , although prices may close the month of september in the upper $ 4 . 00 s per mmbtu , at the high end of the competitive range with resid , any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward during the remainder of september or in october . as the heating season begins , therefore , cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of $ 5 . 00 at the henry hub ( see table 1 ) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price . gas storage  * new record lows cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed into record low territory as of the end of august , when inventories of 2 , 233 bcf fell below the previous 1996 record low of 2 , 245 bcf ( see table 2 ) . more records will likely be broken in the coming months , and by widening margins . injections for september are expected to average 9 . 5 bcf per day , an increase of 2 . 0 bcf per day from the august level but below last year  , s pace of 10 . 3 bcf per day . cera  , s september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather conditions with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico , but injections would likely fall below the 9 . 5 bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms . this rate would leave us inventories at 2 , 518 bcf at month  , s end , a record low by 87 bcf . for october , cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last year . injections of 5 . 5 bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by demand priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropical storm activity . october injections have varied historically from 4 . 0 bcf per day ( 1989 ) to 8 . 5 bcf per day ( 1998 ) . even if injections reached toward the upper end of this range , the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter . at the expected injection rate , us inventories of 2 , 689 bcf at the end of october would result in an end of march 2001 inventory level of 669 bcf under normal winter weather , 89 bcf below the previous record low of 758 bcf . regional markets  * waiting for winter the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified the subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets . cuts in pipeline flows limited access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with any excess capacity . the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market . although summer power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has been restored , the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter heating load will keep intense pressure on topock prices . differentials in the rest of the west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply to ease pipeline bottlenecks ( see table 3 ) . differentials in the east , which have traded in a narrow range this summer , will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in october . however , exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this year . cera  , s outlook by region follows : * rockies . pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during october . cera expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity , differentials will narrow . october differentials should average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . the resumption of flows on el paso  , s southern system , combined with production outages , has relieved some of the access constraints on san juan supply . seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow october differentials to $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . the continuing pull on supplies from the west will support permian prices , and the midwestern pull on supplies will support mid - continent prices . cera expects a differential to the henry hub of $ 0 . 06 per mmbtu for mid - continent supplies and $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu for permian supplies . * chicago . the delay in the in - service date for alliance from october 2 to october 30 will take some gas out of the chicago market next month . this delay , combined with the need to build midwest storage inventories , should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the $ 0 . 05  ) $ 0 . 08 range to above $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu . cera expects october differentials at the chicago citygate to average $ 0 . 11 . * northeast markets . gas prices near $ 5 . 00 have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the northeast , raising the floor level for differentials to near $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu . the beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the new york citygate should support differentials above the floor during october , at near $ 0 . 40 per mmbtu . canadian markets  * outages affect supply outages have affected supply thus far in september . both british columbia and alberta have been affected , resulting in a further year - over - year decline in western canadian supply . the various problems appear to be rectified , but the average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day from september 1999 . drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet weather , but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels . more than 8 , 400 gas wells are expected for this year . slight drop in export demand eastern canadian demand is still down approximately 200 mmcf per day , with cooler - than - normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning . in the west however , cooler - than - normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand for heating requirements of about 200 mmcf per day . exports are down slightly in september compared with september 1999 , with pg & e gt - nw off 110 mmcf per day . northern border is running even with september 1999 . storage picture brighter in canada storage injections in eastern canada have picked up , with inventories now expected to reach the five - year average of 210 bcf . in the west , inventories at the end of the injection season will not only be above the five - year level but should be even with those of 1999 , at 250 bcf . wider differentials holding after widening substantially in august to us $ 1 . 17 , the aeco - to - henry differential has closed back to a more typical level of $ 0 . 60 in september . september  , s aeco price should average us $ 4 . 15 per mmbtu ( c $ 5 . 79 per gigajoule [ gj ] ) , increasing in october to us $ 4 . 35 per mmbtu ( c $ 6 . 07 per gj ) . * * end * * cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e -

2	Subject: re : tax reserve on allegheny peakers the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax ( " sales / use tax " ) liability related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of various equipment ( i . e . , turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee and indiana ) used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois , indiana and tennessee . enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pursuant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny ( effectively , this tax liability is a " pre - acquisition date " tax liability that we , as the seller , are responsible for ) . typically , the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed sales / use tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny . the ews tax department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sales / use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time ( for example , a sales - leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sales / use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ) . ultimately , we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have ( and we believe did in the specific case of allegheny ) modelled the cost of the peakers as including the full current payment of such sales / use tax . that said , we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and , if challenged , there is a risk that we would not prevail . matt is out until may 8 ( he is a recent father of a baby girl ) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like . matt has worked closely with don and others in the generation asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound ( not overly conservative nor liberal ) position . best regards . steve . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : monday , april 30 , 2001 3 : 18 pm to : matthew f gockerman / hou / ect @ enron cc : stephen h douglas / hou / ect @ enron ; don miller / hou / ect @ enron subject : tax reserve on allegheny peakers i notice that our gain has substantially decreased due to a tax reserve increase of $ 5 m . why has this been added and why so recently ? regards louise

2	Subject: organizational changes to : enron north america corp . from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets , and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering  b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries . downstream coverage / origination as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals , plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering : a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products ; b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries ; c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles and glass manufacturing industries . midstream coverage / origination a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this group ; b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ; c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern interconnect ; d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair , formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join this newly formed business . 2 ) commercial transactions : the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical analysis and upstream asset management . the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership , execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions : a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination . b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining , environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks . c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks . d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend . ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together . we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups . please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north america by working with us to implement these changes .

2	Subject: sox financing update the so 2 emissions credits inventory transaction with barclays bank plc has been extended for 12 more months as of yesterday , november 6 . barclays has arranged a facility of $ 170 million , of which $ 158 million was used as of yesterday . as a condition of extending the term past yesterday , barclays required collateral in the form of a cash deposit or an l / c from an acceptable bank . we have posted cash until l / c lines become available . the cash raised , net of collateral posted , was approx $ 98 million , with capacity to put more so 2 credits into the facility . the facility allows enron to raise cash off - balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our so 2 book . as a condition of barclays accepting cash collateral instead of an l / c , we amended the swap master between ena and barclays plc to reduce the number of days to pay to avoid a payment default to one business day from three business days after notification by barclays . this amendment automatically reverts back to the original three business days immediately upon enron posting an l / c to replace the cash collateral . further , barclays has agreed to review the need for collateral in six months , such that if our credit situation improves sufficiently barclays will release the collateral while leaving the facility in place . the terms of the transaction allow egm to sell so 2 credits into the facility and call back the credits on one day ' s notice multiple times over the next year . we pay interest expense in advance as a call option premium ; if we call any credits back early , however , we receive a refund on the unused interest expense . the upfront fee was 50 bp on $ 170 mm for the year ( though we really have 13 months ) and the spread is 65 bp . please contact soma ghosh or me if you would like further updates . on behalf of soma ghosh and jim lewis

2	Subject: approval process for entouch louise - - my recommendation for an approval process for entouch is as follows : 1 ) the deadline to provide information for that week ' s issue of entouch will be wednesday at 12 : 00 pm . all information submitted after that time will be held until the following week . 2 ) a draft of entouch will be forwarded to each business unit head ( or their designee ) and commercial group head ( or their designee ) , who has a business highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue . e - mail , phone or in - person approval will be required from either a business unit head ( or their designee ) or commercial group head ( or their designee ) prior to distribution to enron messaging administration on thursday at 2 : 00 pm . 3 ) if approval is not received prior to the deadline , the business highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received . 4 ) in the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines , all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2 . i believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months . please advise . additionally , i have attached the list of contacts kathie uses for gathering entouch information . it includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts . please feel free to comment on this list . thanks . eric 
2	Subject: fw : tax reserve on allegheny peakers wes , attached is the explanation for the allegheny tax reserve . i do not know why it was increased when it was . it was my understanding that the reserve had been quantified by matt gockerman in my group and requested some time ago and that don and the commercial leads were aware of this . this may be coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly booking currently that which was previously expected ( said differently , without the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the disposition it became necessary to accelerate it as reflected in the tax reserve ) . as always , i have asked that only the absolutely necessary amount be reserved . please call me at ext . 30938 to further discuss this matter . best regards . steve . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : douglas , stephen h . sent : monday , april 30 , 2001 8 : 32 pm to : kitchen , louise subject : re : tax reserve on allegheny peakers the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax ( " sales / use tax " ) liability related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of various equipment ( i . e . , turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee and indiana ) used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois , indiana and tennessee . enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pursuant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny ( effectively , this tax liability is a " pre - acquisition date " tax liability that we , as the seller , are responsible for ) . typically , the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed sales / use tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny . the ews tax department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sales / use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time ( for example , a sales - leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sales / use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ) . ultimately , we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have ( and we believe did in the specific case of allegheny ) modelled the cost of the peakers as including the full current payment of such sales / use tax . that said , we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and , if challenged , there is a risk that we would not prevail . matt is out until may 8 ( he is a recent father of a baby girl ) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like . matt has worked closely with don and others in the generation asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound ( not overly conservative nor liberal ) position . best regards . steve . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : monday , april 30 , 2001 3 : 18 pm to : matthew f gockerman / hou / ect @ enron cc : stephen h douglas / hou / ect @ enron ; don miller / hou / ect @ enron subject : tax reserve on allegheny peakers i notice that our gain has substantially decreased due to a tax reserve increase of $ 5 m . why has this been added and why so recently ? regards louise

2	Subject: urgent contact from the desk of : dr tom eke . e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com lagos - nigeria . attn : request for urgent business relationship . it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter . first , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and " top secret " . though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried , considering the fact that we have not met each other before , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you , so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year 2000 . however , let me start by introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department of petroleum resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel . our duties include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : in the second quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt . during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over - inflate the total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431 million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves . the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us as the contract sum , and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done , but since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million dollars only , we are now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel , we cannot do this by ourselves , as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service , making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now . i have therefore , been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are writing you this letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31 million ) , while 70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below ; a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody , or any form of blackmail . d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from the total amount . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you . we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us . transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives . here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day , thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future , so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty . i will explain more to you when i have heard from you . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e - mail address . i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction . i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . tom eke . n . b . please be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering . this is a complete legitimate business transaction . - -

2	Subject: steve cooper voicemail - 03 / 01 / 2002 on friday , steve cooper left the following voicemail for employees . since some employees do not have access to voicemail , we are providing the following transcript of that message . you can also access this message and past messages at : http : / / home . enron . com / updates / . voicemail from : steve cooper date : friday , march 1 , 2002 hi everybody . it ' s steve cooper . it ' s friday afternoon , march 1 . i hope everybody has had a great week . i want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week , so that you all will be fully in the loop . the week started in a rough - and - tumble fashion . i went to a town meeting monday night to meet with a number of our ex - colleagues . their disappointment , upset and anger is very understandable . i , along with the entire management team , have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues . in order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on , we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $ 5 million fund . we are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees . i wanted you to be aware of that . i really do appreciate and understand everybody ' s upset . last friday , february 22 , we presented to the creditors ' committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program . as can be expected , there was some push back from the committee - - there were issues about some of the data , there were requests for additional data and further clarification . the creditors ' committee formed a subcommittee . we provided to them more data . jeff mcmahon and i met with them on wednesday , february 27 , and we met with them again on thursday , february 28 . we are scheduled to meet with them again on monday and tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the creditors ' committee on this program . i have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is jeff ' s and my highest priority . it is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future , their future compensation , and any financial safety net , so we are going to have to move on this at light speed . i told the creditors ' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of march 11 to motion this up to the court . i ' ll keep you posted on progress . i am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs . hopefully , by the time we have the employee meeting , we can walk through the composition of the program in detail . the powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions . hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week . then , the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases . and it works its way through the review , approval and communication process . so hopefully , we ' ll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases . we reached an accord with the astros this week to repatriate to enron $ 2 . 1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract . it is a shame we won ' t be in a position to support the naming of the field , but it is probably in the best interest of the estate . i got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning enron field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex - employees ' fund . i ' d like your input on that . i thought it was a great idea and very generous . we are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month . hopefully i ' ll be able to meet many of you there . i ' ve tried to get around to say hello here and there . and again , i would encourage you if you have any questions , concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz . sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you , but i ' m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody ' s inquiries . other than that i don ' t have a lot to report . we ' ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program . hopefully by next friday i ' ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area . i want to thank everybody for their efforts , all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward . one other thing ? we did have a bank meeting on thursday afternoon . we have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here . we ' ll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting . i told the bank group , and it was echoed by management , that we believe there is a reorganizable , viable entity in enron ' s future . i ' ll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting . anyway , as i was saying ? thanks so much for all your hard work , your efforts , your dedication . i hope you have a great weekend . i ' ll chat with next week .

2	Subject: four new graphs we have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the dpr : return on var ( rovar ) curve shift p & l ( delta - gamma ) sharpe ratio risk - return ( large ) risk - return ( small ) all of these graphs deal with the concept of risk - adjusted return . the markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics . furthermore , enron ' s appetite for risk also differs in each market . as a result , it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms . therefore , the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk , in effect restating return numbers into a standard base ( how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk ) . for each business unit or commodity group , the rovar graph shows an average of daily total p it shows an average of daily curve shift p & l ( both delta and gamma ) divided by its standard deviation . this sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non - trading p & l ( like new deals , reserves , and so forth ) . furthermore , whereas var is a forward looking statistic ( the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability ) , standard deviation is backward looking ( the actual volatility of our returns over the period ) . this graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity group : a dark brown on the left showing the sharpe ratio on a 4 week rolling basis , and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on a 1 week basis . the curve shift p & l sharpe ratio and the rovar graphs complement each other well . they measure different things , but if our p & l is composed mostly of curve shift , and if our var closely predicts curve shift volatility , the two statistics should be very close . sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the p & l relative to the risk . we therefore put together the risk - return graphs . on the vertical axis , they show 4 week rolling average p & l . on the horizontal , they show 4 week rolling average var . the various business units are plotted as points on the graphs . these graphs are closely related to the 4 - week rovars , in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business unit ' s rovar ( average p & l / average var ) . another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin ( 0 , 0 ) with the plotted point of a business unit is its rovar . books with small risks and returns ( < $ 2 million ) are plotted on the " small " graph , and the rest , on the " large " . these graphs are based on the dpr database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the dpr . most , but not all of the information in the dpr currently flows from the database . as a result , we do not have rovars or sharpe ratios for every business unit . as we continue to set up exports into the database , we will fill in the missing numbers . we will e - mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intra - net . please remember to launch the file in excel , instead of using the lotus notes viewer . the var limit usage graphs that we created last week are already on the web . we hope that you find all of these useful . regards , eugenio perez

2	Subject: california / ferc update 7 / 6 / 01 executive summary ? davis swaps refunds for costly power contracts ? socal bailout - - - bypass ? windfall profits tax in debate refunds and long term contracts the ferc settlement talks are scheduled to end on monday , 9 july . however , as early as today , judge wagner could issue a preliminary finding and if a settlement has not been reached by monday , judge wagner is expected to issue a ruling as soon as possible . judge wagner has made a public statement regarding the level of refund stating that $ 2 b was reasonable to him . by making this comment wagner was probably trying to manage expectations on the amount of a refund . he is viewed as being very savvy and would certainly have had " reasons " to make such a public statement ( since he is not supposed to comment on cases under review - - and has since , ironically , issued a gag order ) . additionally , since ferc only has jurisdiction over about 20 % of the electricity flowing through california , the $ 2 - 3 b level could be accurate from ferc ' s point of view ( if you use the governor ' s $ 9 - 15 b estimates as the gross amount ) . the assumption is that ferc can ' t order refunds from suppliers over whom they have no jurisdiction ( la water , munis , bonneville , etc . ) , and that any ruling will be limited to that percentage over which they can exert some force . governor davis also wants to renegotiate $ 43 b worth of long - term powers contracts in exchange for reducing his demand that generators refund billions for alleged price gouging . speculation on what power generators and marketers would agree to refund vary , with lobbyists for california and other states predicting wagner would recommend a refund of $ 3 - 5 b and those representing power companies saying it would fall well under $ 2 b . wagner has indicated that a refund around $ 2 b might be acceptable , however , given davis ' s new proposal , wagner may sweeten the pot by recommending to ferc that power providers renegotiate long - term contracts and possibly take additional measures to prevent future energy price spikes . while wagner lacks the authority to order the renegotiations of long term power contracts , his recommendation to ferc could lead ferc to issues such an order . socal bailout at this time it appears that efforts in sacramento to work on a socal bailout have essentially ceased . no one is working on a bailout and as we have been saying , it appears that a bankruptcy is a question of " when , " and not " if . " legislators are cautious in pursuing meaningful discussions on the mou until the results of the ferc settlement talks and the amount of the generator give - back ' s are known . even the cpuc has considered the ramifications of current events at ferc and has gone as far as delaying their decision on direct access ( until august ) at the request of ferc commissioner pat wood . windfall profits tax there are currently two bills that deal with windfall profits on generators . of the two bills , sb lxx appears to have more momentum because it is further along in the process and does not make any exemptions for those entities contracting with the state for long - term contracts . sb lxx ( soto ) - windfall profits this bill imposes an electric windfall profits tax on sellers of energy in california if the sales price exceeds $ 80 per mwh or another amount determined by the cpuc . revenue generated from this tax would be distributed , in equal amounts , to personal income taxpayers in the form of a refundable income tax credit . * this bill was set for hearing on 2 july assembly revenue and taxation , but the hearing was postponed until next week due to budget deliberations . * this bill passed the senate floor on may 17 , 2001 on a 23 - 12 vote . the " nay " votes were cast by republicans . * this bill is supported by consumer groups and opposed by several generators including duke , dynegy , reliant , and mirant . while this bill does not provide an exemption for long - term contract holders however , many of the long - term contracts have provisions exemption them from any such tax . ab 2 x ( corbett ) - tax on excess gross receipts this bill would create an excess gross receipts received by sellers of electricity and authorizes the cpuc to set the base price above which the gross receipts tax would apply and establishes an initial base price of $ 60 per mwh . this bill includes provisions that the bill would not apply to any contracts entered into between the state and an energy generator . this bill has opposition from the energy generators and is currently pending on the assembly floor .

2	Subject: el paso statement on california situation in case you haven ' t already seen this : el paso addresses the california energy situation ( february 26 , 2001 ) houston , feb . 26 / prnewswire / - - el paso corporation ( nyse : epg ) reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve california ' s energy situation . " we are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso ' s involvement in california , " said norma dunn , senior vice president of corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation . " we would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record . " the significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power , which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity . high natural gas prices are , therefore , an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage . allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue . it is not possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use that capacity . the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory commission . all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve california and other western markets . allegations that there was a " conspiracy " in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge . the facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction . for example , despite years of marketing efforts by tenneco , not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed altamont project to proceed . for that reason alone , it was ultimately dropped . in 1996 , according to estimates , there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california . indeed , it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to encourage pg & e , socal edison , and socal gas , beginning in 1996 and continuing into 1998 , to relinquish over 1 . 5 bcf / d of firm transportation capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline . processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today . as recently as last year , there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time . notwithstanding its availability , this capacity was not used by shippers to california to fill in - state natural gas storage facilities for future use . if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 , reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided . it is now widely recognized that the california " energy crisis " was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california to keep pace with the state ' s economy and increased demand . a combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices . first , the construction of new power plants in california is a slow , difficult , and heavily regulated process . as a result , the growing demand has far outstripped in - state generating capabilities . second , unfavorable precipitation and increased out - of - state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by california to become unavailable . third , increased demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that california had to pay to out - of - state generators . fourth , state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers , leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs . fifth , because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers , the utilities ' creditworthiness was impaired , causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase . sixth , the early and greater - than - normal use of peaking units - plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditions - necessitated unscheduled maintenance , rendering them unavailable at critical times . seventh , during the final months of 2000 , some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits . eighth , a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power . finally , the increased power costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term power market . " california is currently in a difficult position , but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long - term energy policy , " said dunn . " el paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to california for more than 50 years , and we are actively participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long - term , stable solution to california ' s energy needs . " el paso corporation , the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world , spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron . with an enterprise value in excess of $ 50 billion , el paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry . the company owns and operates a significant portion of the north american natural gas delivery grid , operates the fastest growing , most sophisticated energy merchant group , and is the nation ' s third largest natural gas producer . el paso , a leader in risk management techniques , is focused on maximizing shareholder value , transforming existing markets , and speeding the development of new markets . visit el paso at www . epenergy . com . cautionary statement regarding forward - looking statements this release includes forward - looking statements and projections , made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . the company has made every reasonable effort to ensure that the information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are based are current , reasonable , and complete . however , a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections , anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this release . while the company makes these statements and projections in good faith , neither the company nor its management can guarantee that the anticipated future results will be achieved . reference should be made to the company ' s ( and its affiliates ' ) securities and exchange commission filings for additional important factors that may affect actual results . bob brooks gpcm natural gas market forecasting system http : / / gpcm . rbac . com

2	Subject: organizational announcement - introducing enron engineering and operational services in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit , enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company ( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production corporation ( nepco ) . brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under john gillis , president . with the majority of ee & cc and oec ' s activities focused on assets and projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports . this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units which they support . with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design , construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron ' s assets on a global basis . this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world . please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments . mark frevert & dave delainey

2	Subject: broad update on el paso system el paso south system flows 700 mmcf / d less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on el paso natural gas ' system in southeastern new mexico , the pipeline last week had more than 700 mmcf / d of its 1 . 1 bcf / d capacity restored to its south mainline that services markets between texas and california . at mid - day friday , el paso said it began running about 260 mmcf / d through line 1100 after it received the go - ahead from the federal office of pipeline safety ( ops ) , according to spokeswoman kim wallace . el paso was able to re - start partial service on the 26 - inch line after it built a 16 - inch temporary connector line between line 1110 and line 1100 , which was approved by ops . the temporary connector was installed just east of the pecos river explosion site , about 30 miles from carlsbad , nm . wallace said line 1100 would carry the gas from eunice , nm , just northeast of the pecos river compressor station , to the connector with line 1110 , which then would transport it westward across the pecos river bridge where it would meet up with line 1100 further downstream . meanwhile , wallace said el paso submitted to ops last week the test results and a preliminary return - to - service plan for line 1100 . three days prior , the ops had given el paso permission to restore service to line 1110 from the keystone station through the pecos river compressor station at a reduced level . the pipeline re - opened the line at about 400 mmcf / d , and gradually increased it to 480 mmcf / d by friday . this is " still within the limits it [ ops ] set " for line 1110 , wallace said . the ops restricted el paso ' s line 1110 to 80 % of the operating pressure of line 1103 at the time it ruptured , according to department of transportation spokeswoman debbie hinz . she said this put the line at a pressure of about 538 pounds per square inch . the ops - ordered shutdown of line 1110 lasted 10 days , during which the agency ordered el paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic , ultrasound and x - ray tests to determine its safety , and to submit a plan for restoring service to the line . as for the future of ruptured line 1103 , wallace said repairs on it would not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed , which will " probably be nine to 12 months . " the restoration of service couldn ' t come soon enough for el paso customers who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up el paso ' s south main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and critically injured one . california customers have been taking gas out of storage to meet their needs during the service interruption . the department of energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion and shutdown on the gas market . - -

2	Subject: article about enron - wsj 4 / 17 / 01 - april 17 , 2001 economy electricity facilities sprout near tiny tennessee town by john j . fialka staff reporter of the wall street journal nutbush , tenn . - - this town of about 100 people hasn ' t seen anything quite this electrifying since the 1950 s when a local teenager , annie mae bullock , left town and became tina turner , the queen of rock ' n ' roll . power plants are sprouting in the flat , rich cotton fields nearby . one is under construction ; another is about to start . bulldozers are grooming a site for a third . " we think it ' s great , " says alvin williams , owner of the nutbush grocery and deli , as he prepares for the surge of construction workers who come in for lunch . while this may seem promising at a time of growing energy shortages , the new plants are part of a power clash that presents the bush administration and federal and state regulators with one of their knottiest problems : who controls the nation ' s power grid ? on one side is a new breed of freewheeling energy dealers called merchant traders , spurred by deregulation to generate and trade electricity . led here by enron corp . , they build small gas - fired generating plants , but most don ' t construct their own power lines . instead , they hook up the plants to existing lines and sell electricity wholesale over long distances when prices peak during the summer . thus , many of their plants are called " peakers . " on the other side are old - line utilities , represented here by the federally owned tennessee valley authority . they operate the power lines and warn that the system could become overloaded , leading to blackouts from the imbalance . near nutbush here in tennessee ' s southwest corner , natural - gas pipelines run from the gulf coast and intersect with some of the tva ' s 17 , 000 miles of transmission lines , which are spread over seven southern states . that is what is making nutbush boom : it is an attractive place to connect to the grid . by 2003 , at least 13 new merchant plants altogether will be hooked up across the tva ' s system . there will be dozens more on neighboring systems that will also use tva lines , says w . terry boston , a tva executive vice president . this year , tva expects 300 , 000 requests for wholesale power deals on its system , up from 250 , 000 last year and just 25 , 000 in 1996 . mr . boston foresees a congestion problem that will make it more difficult for the utility to maintain its record of 99 % reliability . " this summer is going to be interesting , " he says . combat started here in the spring of 1999 , when an enron plant at nearby brownsville began bombarding tva with about 800 requests for summer transmission service , up from 33 the tva had received from merchant plants the year before . some were huge , elaborate trades involving brokered electricity from other sources that enron wanted to ship across the tva system . kevin presto , an enron vice president , recalled : the tva " pretty much fought us the whole way , even though they needed the megawatts . " that june , tva pulled the plug , telling enron that from then on , its wheeling and dealing would be confined to the amount of electricity produced in enron plants . enron claimed foul and appealed to the north american electric reliability council , or nerc , , a voluntary organization of utilities and electricity consumers . along with the federal energy regulatory commission and state regulators , nerc functions as the traffic cop for north america ' s power grid . enron also sued the tva and the dispute " raised a number of issues that we are trying to put our fingers on , " says don benjamin , nerc ' s director of operations . one upshot is that it is busy rewriting the rules for how the national grid is controlled . the bush administration ' s energy task force and congress are also looking at the control issue and ways to expand the grid ' s capacity . so far , they have found no easy or inexpensive answers . the grid , with its dense webs surrounding major cities and few links in between , resembles a u . s . highway map from the 1930 s before the interstate system was built . and it is governed by rules that were negotiated by utilities at about that time , as they began to interconnect their systems with their neighbors ' . big utilities became " control areas " that perform the moment - to - moment adjustments that keep lines from overloading and equipment from melting down . with electricity , supply must always match demand . but lately , operators of merchant plants , such as enron , have also qualified to become control areas . regulators have ordered utilities to give merchant power plants open access to the grid , though the utilities sometimes curtail access for " reliability " reasons . " this was a very good system , " sighs thomas overbye , an engineering professor at the university of illinois . but while merchant plants have more access to the grid , he notes , they have little incentive to build more power lines . " when you restructure that way , " asserts mr . overbye . " you ' re going to overload the system , and that ' s exactly what ' s happening . " nerc ' s mr . benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer . " we ' ve got to be able to look at this and see what effects these deals are having on the whole system , " he says . some ad hoc curtailment of wholesale deals and service to customers may be necessary to protect the grid , but the result will be expensive , he notes . " it means that merchants won ' t make money on that deal , and that the customer they sold power to will have to buy it from somebody else . " in the summer of 1999 there were such 70 curtailments ; last summer there were 180 . lynn church , president of the electric power supply association , which represents 40 merchant power companies and electricity traders , suspects that decisions taken by big utilities for " reliability " reasons are sometimes used to block legitimate competition from her members . to prevent this , her group wants more federal control over the grid . " we ' re seeing lots of discrimination . " the tva ' s mr . boston counters that his system can ' t take more " surprises , " such as the one on aug . 19 , 1999 , when a series of wholesale trades brought the tva ' s part of the grid to the brink of collapse from the overload . this year , enron settled its fight with the tva with a secret out - of - court settlement . enron says it is also in the process of selling the plant near here and two others it had hooked to the tva system to other merchant power producers . but it is still waging war over who controls the grid . in a separate case now before the u . s . supreme court , enron argues that ferc has the power to open more of the grid ' s capacity to merchant power plants . utility commissioners from several states argue it doesn ' t . while this is going on , ferc is pondering how to cut back the grid ' s proliferating number of control areas . right now there are about 150 . according to one ferc expert , who asked not to be identified , to avoid " complications " there should be around 14 . meanwhile , officials in tina turner ' s home turf still want the power plant construction to keep on rocking . " there ' s going to be others , " predicts john sharpe , the executive of haywood county , who has been out recruiting more power plants to keep the local economic boost going . " i ' m working my pants off to try and make that happen . " write to john j . fialka at john . fialka @ wsj . com

2	Subject: compliments of the season a very good day to you i am mr . jonathan mwari zuma , an accountant and principal overseer with the south african mining corporation . i got your contact through my local chamber of commerce with the help of a friend in line with the search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction , which involves transfer of fund to a foreign account . this said fund ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) twenty million , five hundred thousand united states dollars , is a variation and accumulation of equity investment made in the south african mining corporation in the period of 1983 - 1987 . this redeemable investment interest , has now matured and has long been cleared for disbursement but with no apparent knowledge of who the investors are as most of the investors then , were corrupt government officials and their cronies under the obnoxious apartheid regime who used pseudo names and aliases in the transactions , and could not come up for claims under the present political setting in south africa . after due consultative sessions with my colleagues in the account department of the mining corporation over the fund ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) , which is now considered as floating fund , we decided to confiscate the fund and placed it in a private trust company for safe keeping , awaiting further transfer to a foreign account for further business ventures . what we need now is a foreign national who can assist us in the transfer of this fund , and also to help invest the fund in a risk free venture . if you are willing to assist us in this transfer , we have agreed to compensate you with a certain percentage ( 15 % ) of the total sum ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) through mutual negotiations . your specialty is not a barrier to this transaction as we have mapped out strategies to effectively actualize this transaction . thank you for your anticipated co - operation , and we hope to hear from you soon , to enable us give you full details of the transactions . alternatively , you can reply using this email below on the contrary , do let me know that you can not transact this business . best regards jonathan mwari zuma jonam 4 zuma @ yahoo . com

2	Subject: safety bulletin the team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over the past several years with team members continuing to be recognized and rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments . as accomplishments are made , trust and responsibilities increase , and the team experiences growth , maturity , and the associated rewards . a part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of the teams responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures . as you heard from me in 2000 , i will protect those who are complying with and enforcing our requirements , but i have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so . along with the rewards for positive efforts , there are also consequences for those who fail to act when circumstances call for action . during the year 2000 , several ets employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act and / or ignoring safe work practices . these cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin . it has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work place even safer . as we publish this first , and hopefully only , safety bulletin in 2001 , i would like to share with you two instances from last year . after repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several safety requirements ( including hard hat , safety glasses , frc ) , one team took action , which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged . while this may seem to be a harsh outcome , it is much better than the person injuring themselves , or even worse , a fellow team member . this person had others expressing concern over his well - being and chose to ignore the warnings . individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole accepted their accountability . in the second case , a team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt . the employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from the vehicle , causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt would have been properly used . this employee is lucky to be alive . use of seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over 20 years . as the use of seat belts is habit forming , could this have been the first time the employee failed to use them ? is it possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past and not acted ? could this have been prevented through positive interaction ? had positive interaction been taken but ignored ? when the declaration of interdependence was introduced in 1998 , we made the commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times . while some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements , that does not relieve the person from their responsibility . likewise , a team is responsible and accountable for the actions ( or lack of a required action ) of each team member . each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to take . please assist us in creating the safest work environment possible . our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night , and should expect nothing less from peers or members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that .

" there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds " to repay the notes , mr . glisan said . " but if we are wrong , we will issue equity . " mr . glisan said a worst - case scenario would involve issuing as much as $ 1 billion in stock . enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding . making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron ' s share price . in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were down 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 . the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands . early this year , enron stock was more than $ 80 a share . during the past week , shares of the energy - trading giant have dropped more than 40 % . early last week , enron reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , resulting from $ 1 . 01 billion in write - offs . the company also disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s . fastow . in july , mr . fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors . on monday , enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr . fastow . enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper . the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while " we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well . " mr . lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs . mr . fastow , the chief financial officer , took part in the conference call . but neither he nor mr . lay would answer any questions concerning the fastow - related partnership , which was known as ljm 2 co - investment lp . mr . lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement , which has raised conflict - of - interest questions among analysts and others . mr . lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions . mr . lay said he was " very concerned about the way andy ' s character has been loosely tossed about . " he added " we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . " internal ljm 2 documents indicate that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership . billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljm 2 - related transactions , according to enron sec filings . during the conference call , analysts - - even some who have been longtime enron fans - - challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the company ' s often opaque financial reports . " there ' s the appearance you are hiding something , " said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer . " you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board . " mr . lay responded , " we ' re trying to be as transparent as we can . " copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron tries to dismiss finance doubts by floyd norris 10 / 24 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company enron has ample access to cash , the company ' s chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write - offs stemming from unusual financing activities . in a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after enron ' s stock plunged on monday , the chief executive , kenneth w . lay , strongly defended the company ' s chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the securities and exchange commission was looking into . but he refused to go into detail on the transaction that enron made with partnerships run by andrew s . fastow , the chief financial officer . in addition , mr . fastow , while declaring that enron ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' declined to answer any questions about it . the conference call , which began just as trading opened on the new york stock exchange , at first seemed to be reassuring investors . within minutes of the beginning of the call , the share price rallied to $ 23 . 25 . but it soon began falling , and ended the day down 86 cents , at $ 19 . 79 . the day ' s low of $ 19 . 62 was the lowest since jan . 12 , 1998 , and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000 . until recently , most investors focused on the company ' s reported operating earnings , which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets . but the focus has shifted to a series of transactions , some involving off - balance - sheet financing . one , involving partnerships controlled by mr . fastow , led to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to s . e . c . inquiries that the company disclosed on monday . one of the company ' s strongest supporters has been david fleischer , an analyst at goldman , sachs . but he told mr . lay on the call yesterday that enron had to be more forthcoming with information . ' ' there is an appearance that you are hiding something , ' ' he said . after the call , mr . fleischer expressed disappointment . ' ' they ' ve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about , and that are hard to understand , ' ' he said in an interview . ' ' they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them ' ' as is needed , he said . but he said he was still recommending the stock . ' ' i don ' t think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans , ' ' he said . ' ' in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company , there is tremendous value here . ' ' mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr . fastow . but he emphasized that both he and the company ' s board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' mr . lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enron ' s reporting in conjunction with another off - balance - sheet vehicle , called marlin . that company owns one - third of azurix , an enron subsidiary that owns wessex , a british water utility . the auditors ' ' have determined there is no write - down required , ' ' he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management , a money management firm . mr . grubman said that marlin owed almost $ 1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake . noting that enron had paid about $ 300 million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write - downs on its investment in azurix , mr . grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt , which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares . mr . lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details . eventually he cut off mr . grubman .

" there was a chinese wall between ljm and enron , " he said , adding that enron wasn ' t obligated to do deals with the ljm entities and did so when it was in enron ' s best interest . lay and enron ' s board continue to have the " highest faith and confidence " in fastow , he added . fastow resigned his roles with the ljm entities in june after criticism from wall street . enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships . it took a $ 35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as a result . during the call enron executives also addressed other issues . they stressed that enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles , whitewing and the atlantic water trust , that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or enron shares at the time of the investments . if enron should lose its current investment - grade quality debt rating , commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of enron ' s current outstanding shares to become diluted . jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons others found their lines dropped mid - stream ) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives . an analyst chided for his part in lowering the company ' s share price was told by ken lay , enron ' s chairman , that his question quota was up and it was time to move on .

" the issue is timing , " jarle sjo , shipping equity analyst at oslo - based investment bank first securities told reuters . " historically , lng projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term , " he added . the world fleet of lng tankers currently numbers 123 , but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004 , according to shipping database fairplay . gas industry analysts expect some lng projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn , excess capacity at existing plants in asia and a sharp fall in u . s . natural gas prices this year . svein erik amundsen , managing director of norwegian shipping group bergesen , said that a sustained economic downturn could have " consequences . " " i wouldn ' t be surprised by project delays , " he told reuters . " this could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment . " " i think you can say we ' re still optimistic , but more cautiously optimistic than before , " he added . bergesen has three new lng ships on order , two of which have already been contracted out to belgian gas distributor distrigas . stop and think the world ' s largest and only pure lng shipping player , golar lng , historically bullish in its outlook , has also been forced to stop and consider the problem . golar has six ships locked into long - term contracts , but four more are under construction at south korea ' s daewoo and hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment . " there is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered , " golar executive vp sveinung stohle told reuters , " the only risk is things might be delayed . " stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option , but it was also developing an lng trading arm , which might have a use for some of them . golar ' s closest competitor in terms of size , exmar , is taking a more traditional approach . it has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance .

2	Subject: california update - urgent please read 5 / 7 / 01 sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today the bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the california assembly . the republicans are currently in caucus until 3 : 30 pst and then will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote , lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely ) socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission line purchase or other assistance . there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by socal . the last republican who gave support to a democratic bill ( ab lx ) , representative bill campbell , lost his job . sources also confirm that democrats have not met with republicans on the bond issuance since last week .
