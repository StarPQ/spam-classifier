2	Subject: california update - urgent please read 5 / 7 / 01 sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today the bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the california assembly . the republicans are currently in caucus until 3 : 30 pst and then will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote , lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely ) socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission line purchase or other assistance . there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by socal . the last republican who gave support to a democratic bill ( ab lx ) , representative bill campbell , lost his job . sources also confirm that democrats have not met with republicans on the bond issuance since last week .

" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at her startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou - sze , vice president , hewlett - packard ( hong kong ) ; patricia barbizet , ceo , artemis ( france ) ; eiko kono , president , recruit ( japan ) : belinda stronach , ceo , magna international ( canada ) ; marina berlusconi , vice chairman , fininvest ( italy ) ; christine tsung , president & ceo , china airlines ( taiwan ) . you can read about the other forty at www . fortune . com or in the international editions of fortune . 2001 fortune 50 most powerful women in american business 2001 2000 rank rank name title company 1 1 carly fiorina chairman and ceo hewlett -

2	Subject: short term private firm model : static historical snapshot + performance data for model development mike , scott , eric , after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows : we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot . monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period . we will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights . for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance . this means that we will need rolling ( 4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts : input snapshots performance 1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12 month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000 1999 feb end , 1999 may end , 1999 august end , 1999 november end 12 month end performance for dec 1999 through nov 2000 1999 jan end , 1999 apr end , 1999 july end , 1999 october end 12 month end performance for nov 1999 through oct 2000 1998 december end , 1999 mar end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end 12 month end performance for oct 1999 through sep 2000 we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the performance period . our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90 + days delinquency on any trade credit . we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture , it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for analysis . please let me know your thoughts . this will require d & b to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly . regards , amitava

2	Subject: re : potential gas system exposure the mapping problem mentioned below is a power desk problem only . the mapping problem is purely between the interface of the gas and power trading systems and does not affect the book if it is strictly a gas trader ' s gas book . there was one instance when a gas trader ' s transactions were incorrectly bridged to a power trader ' s gas book through eol . the root of this problem was with the eol bridge not the interface mapping . the procedure to set up a gas book for power traders includes communication to it regarding the appropriate interface mapping of the book . if for some reason the mapping does not occur , the position will be mapped to a ' dummy ' default desk . we will be alerted when positions are loaded to the ' dummy ' account on a nightly basis in order to investigate the problem and ensure that positions do no get lost in the system . if anyone needs to further discuss the problem we have been having and why it is only the power world that is affected , please give me a call . thanks , stacey ( 3 - 1870 ) from : tim belden 02 / 14 / 2001 05 : 25 pm to : john j lavorato / corp / enron , stacey w white / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , beth perlman / hou / ect , steve nat / corp / enron cc : subject : potential gas system exposure for some period of time , various west power desks have been the default desk which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in tagg . i have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get west power out of this problem . i ' m happy with the result from the west power point of view . i am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists . if someone does a gas deal and hasn ' t set up a new book properly and doesn ' t carefully track his / her position , the trade goes into a dummy book that nobody manages . days , weeks , or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain . i think that this risk is real because we were the ones finding the misplaced gas trades before - - not the gas desk with the misplaced trade . now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes that some of his / her position is missing . these are the facts as i understand them . i ' m sure that stacey white , steve nat , and monica lande could fill you in with more detailed information . let me know if i can be of further assistance . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by tim belden / hou / ect on 02 / 14 / 2001 02 : 18 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - monica lande 02 / 14 / 2001 02 : 34 pm to : tim belden / hou / ect @ ect cc : fran chang / pdx / ect @ ect , valarie sabo / pdx / ect @ ect , samantha law / pdx / ect @ ect subject : re : remaining problem with west tot tim , steve has described the problem accurately . setting up a dummy book solves the problem for us , but not for enron as a whole . if no one monitors the dummy book on the daily basis ( which probably won ' t happen if there is no ownership ) , then you still have the possibility of positions falling into that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended . why can ' t a process be put in place for the initial set - up of a book in tagg ?

2	Subject: transportation as a commodity . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com [ mailto : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com ] sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 10 : 43 pm to : 168842 @ mailman . enron . com subject : rahil jafry : transportation as a commodity . transportation as a commodity . by bill hensel jr . 09 / 10 / 2001 joc week copyright ( c ) 2001 . the journal of commerce inc . all rights reserved . enron corp . , the houston - based energy giant , is familiar with commodity markets . in addition to energy , the business for which it is best known , enron is the world ' s largest metals trader . the company also understands transportation . it ships products as diverse as coal , steel , forest products and project cargo . now enron is proposing to change the face of over - the - road trucking and domestic intermodal services , by treating them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product . the company ' s enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and other shipping costs . enron will quote a set rate for dock - to - dock moves , and guarantee the service promised in the contract . enron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in transportation . as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork bellies , a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery of the service or closing out his position . enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in energy . can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight capacity ? barry par - ker , a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . , which specializes in freight economics , said it could work but that transportation isn ' t like other markets . " the marketplace needs these things , but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them , " parker said . " i applaud what they are doing , but it is an uphill battle . " enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal , a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers , shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight ' s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer , enron took another step , by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper , but declined to identify it . dan reck , vice president of enron freight markets , said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . " what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market , " reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times , and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges , spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid , but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . " what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable , " reck said . " so from a carrier ' s perspective , they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . " enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets , and is trying to change the way other markets , such as steel , are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . " we are kind of commodity - agnostic , " reck explained . " we don ' t care what the commodity is , we just sell capacity . " enron ' s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte , the former national transportation exchange , puts buyers and sellers directly together , while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services , enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron ' s ideal contract , damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example , suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile , enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn ' t , enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers , carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ' ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a forum for negotiations , which the company believes would add legitimacy . in its first contract , enron is acting as a carrier , since the shipper already was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron considers itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves and leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk , for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees . enron is an extensive user of the internet , however , and last year launched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas , oil , electricity and various other commodities online . no one expects enron ' s new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry , and that enron is prepared for that . " we have done that in every market we have gotten into , " reck said . " what we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time . you have to show what the benefits are . " jocoo 000 .

2	Subject: uk rpi model hi zimin ! please find attached for your review the uk rpi model , derived by bootstrapping rpi swaps . it ' s a very simple model and here are its specifics : swap structure payment : semi / semi act / 365 f > > yoyukrpi  ( ukrpi ( p - 2 ) / ukrpi ( p - 14 ) - 1 ) / 2 > p  payment month > the first payment is the latest known historical rpi , february 2000 , 2 . 32 % . assumptions * constant cashflows between the quoted years ( as opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot ) . this explains the atrocious look of the " raw " curve . it is then smoothed with a macro , which anjam wrote . * mid point of the swaps is used for deriving the curve ; * discount rate is libor and i solve for the coupon rate , which is the rpi yoy rate ; * the above is solved separately for each quoted period ( e . g . 2 yrs , 5 yrs ) and rpi rates are determined for the incremental portion . by forecasting rpi in the above method we are able to lock in and deliver the forecasted levels . looking forward to your comments and seeing you in london ! best regards , martina x 34327

2	Subject: good day friend dear friend , my name is salim ibrahim a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give also to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ( twenty million five hundred thousand u . s dollars ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside 15 % for you . god be with you . salim ibrahim note : please do get back to me via my private email address at ibrahim _ salim @ ny . com becuase i do not want my family to know anything about this project , so i could give you the full details about the funds . please endeavour to get back to me via my specified private email address . thanks for understanding . may the almighty allah bless you abondantly . mail enviado desde el servicio webmail en el sitio | * btw * | call of duty - . . /

2	Subject: personal contact from the desk of : mr paolo abate . banca intesa , torino agenzia 3 , piazza della repubblica , torino italy . alternative email address : p _ abate 3 @ virgilio . it i am mr . paolo abate , manager of banca intesa private banking sector , torino agenzia 3 , torino , italy . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . on june 6 , 1999 , mr . richard smith came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 5 . 7 million usd , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . based on the investment , we spun the money around which with accrued profit and interest stood at over 6 . 5 million united states dollars . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in antwerp . he directed that i liquidate the funds and have it deposited with a firm in brussels . i informed him that banca intesa would have to make special arrangements to have this don and in order not to circumvent due process ; the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in brussels and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the uk based security consultancy firm . mr . richard . smith told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th october 2001 . in june later year , we got a call from uk based firm informing us about the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned ; given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at uk based firm and i could not understand why mr . richard . had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate mr . richard no success , four weeks later , information started to trickle in , apparently mr . richard smith was dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . i mr . richard smith died in testate . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ’ s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct uk based firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to mr . richard . i will then officially communicate with uk based firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have uk based firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from uk we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you regards paolo abate . mail sent from white revolution - http : / / www . whiterevolution . com 
2	Subject: vitro project brian , it occurred to me that we haven ' t spoken about the ongoing management / oversite of the construction of the vitro project in light of next week ' s expected events . while we have discussed eeos ' s role with tractebel , we need to keep in mind that we need a technical person to monitor the construction process to protect enron ' s remaining 20 % interest . i believe steve irvin had planned on using robert rimbau . unsure if robert works for you or virgo , but regardless , enron needs someone to monitor the construction process . secondly , also keep in mind that we are technically still on the hook to be the operator of the project . while we are working with tractebel to transition out of the operating role , we haven ' t yet completed the transition . we want to make sure that we don ' t breach any agreement with the idb . let ' s talk as soon as possible to make sure that we have these issues adequately covered . we probably need to engage steve irvin as well . i am unsure of his status , but i will check with louise . thanks , don 713 - 529 - 6280 home 713 - 412 - 8967 cell

2	Subject: reply ; from mr . jeftha dear friend , how are you today ? you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you do not know me personally , but for purpose of introduction . i am mr . james john jeftha , the first son of dr , peter jeftha , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i got your contact through my personal search for a honest and trustworthy individual , who can help my family in receiving this fund , for proper investment and safe keeping , and i decided to write to you , for assistance and business co - operation . before the death of my father , he had taken me to oversea to deposit the total sum of ( us $ 16 , 8 million united states dollars ) , with a security and finance company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . the money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid demurrage from the security company . this amount was made for establishment of an industry in uk . this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act , which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted in killing and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society . in fact , more than thirty ( 30 ) people have been killed because of this land reform act . heads of governments from the west especially britain have condemned mugabe ’ s new land reform act and for this reason , sadc ( southern african development community ) heads of states have met and voiced their support for mr . mugabe . south african president and the president of malawi have been sent by sadc to britain to support mugabe ’ s new land reform act . it is against this background , that i and my family , who are currently staying in europe right because of this problem , have decided to transfer my father ’ s money to a foreign account . as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with this responsibility of seeking a genuine account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got and other african governments seem to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since most of the countries have lost similar political history . however , the european union foreign exchange policy where i am right now does not allow such investment as i am seeking for asylum . i don ’ t want to disclose all the information about me , and where i am residing right now for fear of having my asylum request cancelled by the authorities in my host country , but immediately you get back to me , i will give you the necessary information . as a businessman , whom i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk - free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter . therefore , if you accept to assist my family and me , we are willing to offer 30 % of the total sum for your assistance needed , 60 % for me and my family while 10 % will be mapped out for any pre - transfer charges or bank charges . i would wish to invest in your country on commercial properties and buying of rents based on your advice or from experts in your country . if this proposal is acceptable by you , please , send me your contacts ; address , telephone and fax numbers . you should note that this transaction is highly confidential and should be kept within you alone . your urgent response and acceptance will be highly appreciated . please forward your reply to my private address : jmsjeftha @ velocall . com , jmsjeftha @ jumpy . it regards , mr . james john jeftha , ( for the family ) sent by excite inbox - http : / / inbox . excite . co . uk powered by excite uk - http : / / www . excite . co . uk

2	Subject: business intent dear sir , i am stanley woodwork , the secetary of africa white farmers co - operation ( awfc ) of zimbabwe . after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr . robert mugabe won the presidential election , the government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme . this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans . this programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister , mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse . two weeks ago , our headquartes in harare was attacked and looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building . fortunately , they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co - operation . this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government . now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe . the cash in question is us $ 46 million dollars . once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe , where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us . you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe , and the business proposal is 100 % legal and risk free . you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe . please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government . i expect 100 % confidentiality and your prompt response to this mail so as to proceed . you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork @ email . com kind regards , stanley woodwork .

2	Subject:  dear sir / madam , i beg you to carefully go through this email and should it not meet your business or personal ethics , please accept my apologies in advance . my name is david roberts , the chief executive of private clients international of the barclays group with head office at 54 lombard street , london ec 3 p 3 ah . i am writing this letter to solicit for your support and assistance to carry out a project concerning a late customer of the bank by name dr . victor morgan , an oil magnet and philanthropist who died on the 14 th of june 2002 in the london hospital after being involved in fatal car crash which also claimed the life of his wife and two sons . lying in his inactive account in one of our branches is the sum of thirty million united states dollars . ever since he died the bank has placed a stop on all transactions on this account pending when his next of kin would come forward for necessary actions , identification and collection . unfortunately from our investigations and confirmations from his attorney he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the money and as such , we have decided to do business with you . if you stand in as the beneficiary of this funds the money will be released to you , after the due processes have being followed . obviously we do not want this money to go into the bank treasury because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such fund remains unclaimed for 3 years , the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed debt . this would not take too much time to get done as his lawyer already has the necessary letters of administration and court orders from the british high court which are part of the documents required by the barclays bank to process fund release approvals . to do this work 75 % of the money will be for our end , 20 % will be for you while 5 % will be for any xpenses incurred during the transaction . please reach me at my private email address above , if willing to do business with us . thanks and regards , david roberts . disclaimer : this message contains confidential information and is intended only for specified addressee . if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate , distribute or copy this e - mail . the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message , which arise as a result of e - mail transmission . please note that we reserve the right to monitor and read any emails sent and received by the barclays group under the telecommunications ( lawful business practice ) ( interception of communications ) regulations 2000 .

2	Subject: update on el paso ' s nm pipeline testing el paso proceeding with nm pipe integrity testing el paso natural gas has received approval from the u . s . department of transportation ' s office of pipeline safety ( ops ) to conduct more internal inspections on its rebuilt new mexico pipeline , which ruptured august 19 killing 11 people ( see daily gpi , aug . 22 ) . since the explosion , flows through the line , which runs from west texas to california , have been reduced to 85 % capacity , or about 920 mmcf / d . ops said the el paso line has already been repaired and put through hydrostatic testing , which it passed . hydrostatic testing checks for cracks by forcing high - pressure water through the line . now el paso has the green light to begin smart pig testing , which will examine the internal integrity of the line . the device , called a pig because of the sound it makes during inspections , has sensors and once placed inside the line , it can detect dents , deformities and changes in wall thickness . neither ops nor el paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would occur or how long it would take . however , once the testing is completed , the results will be evaluated by ops , which then would determine if the line were safe for commercial use . ops has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use , but they have become increasingly sophisticated and more widely used . even though hydrostatic testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs , the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and ensures more integrity in test results . ops requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after construction . although not mandated , ops also has proposed requiring pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline ' s integrity . other types of inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the pipe wall ' s thickness . - -

2	Subject: let \ " s help the orphans dear friend , greetings to you and your family ! this mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind ; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility . my name is jose a . martinez . i am a 64 years old man , i am cuban currently residing in dubai ( united arab emirate ) . i was formerly living in cuba and served under castro ` s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling government of fidel castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti - government statements , i was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of castro ` s goons fell on them . l did made a lot of money serving castro and on getting to uae , i have been a merchant here in dubai dealing in rnamentals , oriental carpets and artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three ( 3 ) years ago when i was first diagnosed of cancer of the larynx . before is happened my business and concern for making money was all i lived for , i never really cared about other values in life . but since the loss of my family and hometown , i have found a new desire to assist helpless families . i have been helping orphans in orphanage / motherless homes . i have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged eritrea , somalia , sudan and some east european countries . before i became ill , i kept $ 4 . 5 million ( four million five hundred thousand us dollars ) in a long - term deposit vault in a bank in europe and i didn ` t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if i died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the bank and i don ` t want this to happen . i have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic , i have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer at the hospital . i have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that i have only a few months to live . it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations . because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness , i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them . please , i beg you in the name of god to help me collect the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations . use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations . i am going to send you vital documents to back my claims and i am willing to offer you a reward if you are willing to help , please reply as soon as you can to this email address looking forward to hearing from you soonest . regards , jose . a martinez mail sent from webmail service at php - nuke powered site - http : / / yoursite . com

2	Subject: re : choosing the riskfree rate dear all , i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable benchmarks . i also think that fmas have their own advantages and disadvantages . however , it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor as benchmark - at least to price anything related to capital markets ( for example , credit default swaps ) . our prices will always be different from that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market . as a half - way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example , use anything , that we decide is closest to risk - free , to value products significantly different from that priced on capital markets , and libor for everything priced on capital markets . we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients ( event , liquidity , recovery ) for our purposes , but it looks like benchmark should be libor . to avoid negative default probabilites ( for highly rated reference entities ) we can add cost fo repo and haircuts ( as all bankers do ) . let us continue our discussion on this . slava benjamin parsons 13 / 03 / 2000 20 : 07 to : bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect , martin mcdermott / lon / ect @ ect , viacheslav danilov / lon / ect @ ect , stuart ffoulkes / lon / ect @ ect , eklavya sareen / lon / ect @ ect , tomas valnek / lon / ect @ ect , john metzler / lon / ect @ ect , simon brooks / lon / ect @ ect , konstantin malinovski / lon / ect @ ect cc : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra patel / lon / ect @ ect , william s bradford / hou / ect @ ect , harry arora / hou / ect @ ect subject : choosing the riskfree rate dear all , following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago , regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree curve , i ' ve written the attached short document . my preliminary conclusions are as follows : recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30 - year bonds . treasuries are still the most liquid curve , and that used by banks for benchmarking risky debt . there is a considerable a liquidity / scarcity premium inherent within the corporate - treasury spread , which we are not taking into account . more accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy prices based on treasuries , which are consistent with the market . all further comments are welcome of course . regards ben

" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

" today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence , " fitch said . fitch cut houston - based enron ' s senior unsecured debt to " bbb - minus , " one notch above junk , from " bbb - plus , " its subordinated debt to " bb " from " bbb , " and its commercial paper to " f 3 " from " f 2 . " the rating agency also downgraded enron ' s preferred stock to " b - plus " from " bbb - minus . " fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management priority , and if enron is successful , the company ' s credit profile will improve . " however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging - market countries , " fitch said . fitch ' s cut follows downgrades last week by moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s . enron ' s shares have lost more than 65 percent in less than a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . s & p last thursday cut enron ' s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to " bbb , " two notches above junk status , from " bbb - plus . " moody ' s investors service last monday cut enron ' s senior unsecured debt to " baa 2 , " two notches above junk , from " baal . " downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral . enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence , according to investment bankers . in its third - quarter results report last month , enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write - offs related to soured investments . it also announced an extra $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in 2006 , bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a week ago , were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on monday , a strategist said . enron shares were up 40 cents , or 3 . 55 percent , at $ 11 . 67 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . the shares have been in free - fall for two weeks . copyright ? 2000 dow jones maintains rtg watch negative 11 / 05 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 5 , 2001 - - fitch downgrades enron ' s outstanding securities as follows : senior unsecured debt to ` bbb - ' from ` bbb + ' ; subordinated debt to ` bb ` from ` bbb ' ; and preferred stock to ` b + ' from ` bbb - ` . enron ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ` f 3 ' from ` f 2 ' . the senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries , northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , are lowered to ` bbb - ' from ` a - ` . all the above securities remain on rating watch negative status . fitch would consider further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt , if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration , or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non - core businesses and investments exceed present estimations . today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence . this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments , which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off - balance sheet vehicles . enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment , ultimately recognizing the values of the company ' s core businesses . in october , enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper , leaving it approximately $ 1 billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities . in addition , the company is in the process of executing a new $ 1 billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern . unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage . while its current cash position appears adequate , securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development . a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses . clearly , these actions , if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company ' s credit profile . however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries . an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commission ' s ( sec ) investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships . the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict . the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric co . ( pge ) to northwest natural gas co . the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests . however , the transaction is not expected to close for another year . enron ' s core businesses have continued to generate strong , predictable performance and have significant value . prospectively , operations at enron ' s domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron . also , pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year . combined , the pipelines and pge generate nearly 25 % of ebitda . wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns . specifically , commodity marketing and trading activities , which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations , have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins . however , if enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility , these businesses would be harmed . contact : fitch , new york ralph pellecchia , 212 / 908 - 0586 robert grossman , 212 / 908 - 0535 hugh welton , 212 / 908 - 0746 11 : 13 est november 5 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron sr . unsecured debt cut to triple - b - minus by fitch 11 / 05 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - fitch downgraded enron corp .

" the cut continues the aggressive moves on the part of the fed , and it comes on top of a huge move by the treasury . the treasury did more in one fell swoop last week than the fed ' s done all year .

2	Subject: next of kin [ business ] goodday , i am frenkel heydorn , staff of smith came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of thirty million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case , i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the united kingdom . he directed that i liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm . i informed him that smith & williamson would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with the security firm . the security firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited with the security firm . the deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th february 2003 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm , and i could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate the deceased . i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of smith depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; the deceased died without a testate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . it is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased . my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation . what this means , you being the last batch of names we have considered , is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member . this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit . according to practice , the security firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to smith & williamson , failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to smith & williamson . this will result in the money entering the smith & williamson accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division . this will not happen if i have my way . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is thirty million dollars deposited in a security firm , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as smith they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; you share the same surname with our late client ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the security firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased i will then officially communicate with the security firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the security firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the security company . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . these chances wont pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . lets share the blessing . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through this email account if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through this email address . i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . i await your response . frenkel heydorn . mail sent from webmail service at php - nuke powered site fanghaowen . com - http : / / fanghaowen . com

2	Subject:  poisoning diagnosis ' rock solid ' ( cnn ) - - the doctor who has overseen the treatment in vienna of ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko says the diagnosis of dioxin poisoning is " rock solid , " but says more information must be obtained before medical authorities can determine the candidate ' s prognosis . dr . michael zimpfer told cnn sunday that he based his conclusion on a physical examination of the patient and " various blood tests " carried out at vienna ' s rudolfinerhaus clinic and elsewhere . zimpfer told reporters over the weekend that the concentration of dioxin in yushchenko ' s body was " 1 , 000 times above the normal levels " and that he suspected " third - party involvement . " the revelation prompted ukraine ' s prosecutor - general to reopen a probe into the opposition leader ' s illness . " we have sent samples to a lab within europe and also to labs across the atlantic ocean that claim to have vast experience , and they came up with the results , " zimpfer told cnn late sunday . yushchenko has " a tremendous amount of dioxin in the blood , " zimpfer said , so much that " it ' s beyond the scale . " yushchenko has accused ukrainian authorities of having tried to poison him in the run - up to november ' s fraudulent presidential election . ukraine ' s supreme court voided the outcome after yushchenko lost to prime minister viktor yanukovich , and a rerun of the contest is slated to be held on december 26 . the 50 - year - old , then - telegenic campaigner was taken to the vienna hospital in september , when he first fell ill . he resumed campaigning later in the month but with a pockmarked and badly disfigured face . given what little medical information has been released publicly , yushchenko could have been exposed to any of about 20 dioxins or dioxin - like chemicals , said dr . arnold schecter , professor of medicine at the university texas school of public health at southwestern medical center in dallas .

2	Subject: enron files chapter 11 reorganization to all employees : this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses : - - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner . - - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing . - - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion . - - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline . these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so . as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer . for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination . i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions . when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities . on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future . ken

2	Subject: uk submission of positions just to follow up on james ' s note of yesterday - my apologies for being out the elimination of the requirement to ' grab ' the fx and ir market environment from houston ( and consequently use european data ) can improve our ability to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening . james and i will be working with brian hudson to determine the timetable for effecting this change the revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver completed results by the time the risk management team arrive at their desks in the morning . system failures are the most significant problem we face in delivering timely information to houston . consequently the probability of meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we will have full it overnight support covering for any it failure and curve input validation processes on trade date . indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to deliver officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( david hardy is in final testing of the eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 am deadline ( houston 4 am ) flash p & l by the lpm deadline ( houston 7 am ) completion of the final dpr to be submitted to houston by the 5 pm deadline ( houston 11 am ) james and i are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible changes to business processes that could improve these times . this is in addition to working with commercial and it to assess the possibility of delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in delivering a trade date control process . i can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area , however , we are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved / more real time control . please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary . regards mike - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 19 / 12 / 2000 15 : 06 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - james new 18 / 12 / 2000 09 : 10 to : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , gary hickerson / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk submission of positions rick , thanks you for your note below . we are today implementing a flash p & l process . we aim to report daily numbers at 7 am houston time and will start today with the p & l . we will build on this and hope to have draft positions and var for most books within a week or so . there will be a reconciliation of flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to houston . i will put together a note on the london dpr production process which goes into the process we currently have , the process we actually need to have , and the obstacles that are in the way . i would expect this to be finalised tomorrow . obtaining the usd interest rate curve on a more timely basis is just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most serious problem . james from : rick buy 15 / 12 / 2000 21 : 59 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect cc : gary hickerson / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk submission of positions need your help on the following : each day we are delayed in finalising var , p & l and positions because the uk must wait for a usd interest rate curves before submitting their data to houston . i am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business london . even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now . this would greatly improve the efficiency ( by 4 to 6 hours ) in reporting to senior management . can you guys initiate this change or get me to the right person there . thanks , rick

2	Subject: privileged & confidential attorney - client communication terminability of val verde interconnect agreement i ' ve looked into whether we can terminate our val verde interconnect agreement with burlington , and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps : 1 . terminate the oba by giving 30 days notice to burlington . paragraph 13 of the 6 / 1 / 94 oba with burlington ( as successor in interest to meridian ) provides that either party may terminate the oba " at the end of the primary term , or thereafter by providing thirty ( 30 ) days prior written notice " to burlington . ( the one - month primary term ended june 30 , 1994 and has since gone month - to - month . ) 2 . on the effective termination date of the oba , terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to burlington . the 12 / 31 / 92 interconnect point operating agreement , paragraph 6 , provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term . this is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12 / 31 / 02 . however , the paragraph also provides that the agreement " may be terminated by either party upon thirty ( 30 ) days prior written notice in the event the oba between the parties is terminated . " as we ' ve already discussed , termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first . let me know if you have further questions .

2	Subject: testing the psw and path confirm report good morning / afternoon / evening ; i started working in june 22 to test path cut capabilities . i was able to save a cut path . please make sure that bill williams iii and whomever he designates has access to enpower testp so that i can walk them through the app when it is ready . right now it looks like mark guzman and kate symes will be the voice of west real time . a real time question : when enpower is taken down for maintenance , as it sometimes is at night , will this application still function ? if not , we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when enpower is being maintained . re - running june 20 th as a completely new day : this entire test was done in local enpower preschedule workspace : running build route report : criteria selection - unable to select criteria for build route , got " list index out of bounds ( 4 ) " error * needs fix error checking - took 1 : 29 , produced a line by line error sheet that is printable , * accepted but routing errors for lines 19 - 223 in the cob sheet produced a routing error that just states " error : " no reason . we need to know why an error is shown ( was run after all routes were deleted ) * needs fix uploading to the path confirm area : * accepted mid c - 1 : 53 rockies - 0 : 22 palo 1 : 11 cob 0 : 49 ( row 69 generated a general sql error message ) daily summary function routing : * accepted mid c - 13 : 27 rockies - 2 : 23 palo 7 : 56 cob 5 : 12 path confirmation : speed is very much an issue here , i had mark guzman sit with me while i cut a path and when i confirmed a group of paths . the confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time i entered the name and hit the " ok " button until the confriming was completed . this is too long , we need this to be 20 - 30 seconds max . currently , this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus . cutting a path went fast enough until i closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report . this also took over a minute . this is another 10 second process in lotus . one little housekeeping thing , can we move the delete button away from the confrim button ? perhaps on the other side of the exit button ? this will save us mucho headaches later . or make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion ? real time discussion : where are we on this ? i heard initial rumblings , but nothing lately .

( release , fts 3 , ftsl , lft , efbh ) . this process finds the marketing lateral for the primary receipt and primary delivery pionts & identifies all possible laterals between the primary receipt to primary delivery that can be valid alternate points inside the path and stores those to be used in the allocation process . it maps it out for each firm contract . this process is uses the valid marketing laterals to build the inside alternate paths . any contract whose alternate receipt or alternate delvery point that is not in the valid available marketing lateral is an outside the path transaction . tms uses this process in the allocations on tw . with revalidation the tms system checks for contracts that change primary receipt points and delivery points in the evening , nongrid , i / dl , and i / d 2 cycles . however the stored procedure batch job is a maunal process , the contract team would submit this batch job on demand so that it can identify the valid marketing laterals for that specific contract that was changed . i would like to see this automated with the new cms system . each time a firm contract is changed for a gas day after the timely cycle is run , this batch job or stored procedure should automaticly rum again for that contract that was changed . thanks ramona - - - - - original message - - - - - from : lee , dennis sent : friday , july 27 , 2001 9 : 44 am to : betancourt , ramona subject : fw : tw flow direction ramona , let me know , please . thanks , dennis - - - - - original message - - - - - from : trevino , linda sent : friday , july 27 , 2001 7 : 19 am to : lee , dennis subject : tw flow direction dennis , i noticed on ramona ' s bullets she was working with marketing and contracts on the tw flow direction business requirements . are you in the loop on this ? if not could you please let her know that you need to be in the loop and see if there is anything documented as of yet on this ? i would like to see some type of documentation as soon as possible . thanks linda

2	Subject: update on retention & severance plan we know how interested all of you are in the retention & severance plan , so we want to update you on its status . as many of you know , we have been working with members of the creditors ' committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention & severance plan , and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday , february 22 . we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month . we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention & severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave . we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed . we ' re learning that , in bankruptcy , most things don ' t move as quickly as we are accustomed . the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan , but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns . the creditors ' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention & severance plan . such plans align the company ' s objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy . these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate . the creditors ' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process . to that end , we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee . we intend to work hand - in - hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible . this is currently our top priority , bar none ! when we filed for bankruptcy , we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be . unfortunately , that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place . we now know that it takes significant time , resources and effort to understand , identify and gather the massive volume of required details , to formulate that information into a reasonable program , and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation . the process mirrors the most time - intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved . that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse . we remain committed to working with the creditors ' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan . we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so , and have targeted the week of march 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court . we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court . with respect to non - debtor companies , or those companies not in bankruptcy , new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future . in the meantime , we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week . and of course , we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible .
