2	Subject: california update 5 / 22 / 01 please treat as confidential a source had a meeting today with california state treasurer phil angelides . here are the main points from their conversation 1 . anglelides certain that socal will go bankrupt corroborating our line over the past four months , anglelides stated with confidence that socal would go bankrupt and that " he was surprised they hadn ' t already . " he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that " they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent " and that " their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . " he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the " plan b ' s " are " speculative " at best . he also thought that socal was being " naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . " 2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that " $ 12 b was all the market could handle . " the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office . 3 . new generator construction anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will " build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be " 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

" states the following . for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is $ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu . i believe , if i am reading it correctly , the money should flow in the opposite direction , namely : for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is $ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu . am i right ? again , thank you very much for your time . - resume . doc

of bible reading from public schools a few years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington , dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america . they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a christian can help ! we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned about our country . as christians we must unite on this . please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in our school and in offices across the nation . please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard . together we can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity for the lost to know the lord . please press " forward " , clean up the message , and forward this to everyone that you think should read this . now , please sign your name at the bottom ( you can only add your name after you have pressed the " forward " ) . don ' t delete any other names , just go to the next number and type your name . please do not sign jointly , such as mr . & mrs . each person should sign his / her own name . please e -

( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in the oil & gas and petrochemical industries . although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they can also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur , such as a well filling with water . as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid can also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level . vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against threat . preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u . s . industry and economy . the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock . information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

2	Subject: organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron wind , will report to cliff . corporate staff we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources , government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . committee structure in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be drawing on this group to lead company -

2	Subject: prudency wes , as we discussed on friday , i think that there is merit to your arguments regarding the release in prudency in north america . however , this may alter the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and ratings agencies . de facto , we will be saying that our balance sheet and income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in north america at the mid with no adverse effects . while this may be true , typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more liquid portfolios , i . e . , they will not believe that we have perfect liquidity . i believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an " orderly liquidation " under a negative pricing scenario ( basically , multiple horizon var against a liquidating position ) . this is what we showed moody ' s last month . the main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p & l as opposed to having reserves against it . this is a long way of saying that i think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both rac and treasury once you have finalized a course of action . ted

2	Subject: texas general land office it transport gerald / eric - i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract 012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then , is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ? i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ? thanks for your help .

2	Subject: deb mcdonald reveals a little bit of ngpl ' s strategy in interview ngpl recontracts with nipsco natural gas pipeline company of america ( ngpl ) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter . since kinder morgan took over ngpl parent kn energy last year , the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the midwest , including another deal announced yesterday with northern indiana public service ( nipsco ) . ngpl and nipsco signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295 , 100 mmbtu / d of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and dec . 1 , 2001 and continuing through nov . 30 , 2002 . they also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10 . 5 bcf of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and april 1 , 2001 and continuing through march 31 , 2003 . nipsco , a nisource subsidiary , is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700 , 000 customers and electricity to 416 , 000 customers across the northern third of indiana . " virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year , " said ngpl president deborah mcdonald in an interview . " basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year . we ' ve been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [ nigas , nipsco and peoples ] . " despite increasing competitive pressure from northern border and alliance pipeline , the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators . " in contrast to the traditional market of long - haul transportation from the midcontinent and louisiana to chicago , we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core ldcs . obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with aquila energy for 500 , 000 mmbtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts , " mcdonald said . " we also have developed a number of new rate services for gas - fired power generators . growth in ngpl will come from natural gas - fired generation . you probably saw our press release about the ameren contracts for [ construction of 1 , 700 mw of generation along the ngpl system ] . in the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3 , 000 mw of gas - fired generation this year and over 3 , 000 mw next year as well [ which would represent up to 900 mmcf / d in gas transportation capacity ] . " obviously another challenge is going to be [ the 1 . 325 bcf / d ] alliance pipeline coming into the market this fall . it ' s anyone ' s guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time . i think a lot of that will be coming into chicago and moving back out on vector . but we ' re ready at hub america to kind of serve as a giant header system [ with texas eastern as an eastbound partner ] .

2	Subject: enron online case hi chris ! thanks for the message and the great experience at harvard last week ! harvard ' s hospitality was the best ! ! i ' m travelling right now and only have a minute , but i ' ve passed along your request to louise and will follow up with her and the totality of your request on monday . ( i also told louise she was a " star in absentia " at harvard last week ! ! ! ) take care and we ' ll speak soon ! best ! - - christie . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by christie patrick / hou / ect on 05 / 03 / 2001 01 : 02 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - christopher bartlett on 05 / 03 / 2001 09 : 33 : 48 am to : christie . patrick @ enron . com cc : subject : enron online case christie : following up on my message of last week , i have now finished the minor edits required to clarify the enron online case ( correcting the stock price , clarifying the " one to many " versus " many to many " models of trading , etc . ) . the one piece that remains for me to insert is some information that will allow the students to make some estimates about the economic risk involved in this bold move . i know that wholesale services contributed about 89 % of enron ' s total profit in 1999 , but it is unclear what extent of this was provided by the traditional trading activities that subsequently were enhanced by enron online . my suspicion is that it is the majority of the sales volume , and perhaps the majority of profitability , but if we could give some clue to that in the case , it would be helpful . this might simply be that " trading activities constituted the majority of wholesale services profits " or " the vast majority " or " over 80 % " or whatever you think would give the students some sense of quantification . the alternative might be to provide data that was disguised and could be footnoted as such . for example , we could identify that trading contributed " over $ 750 million to enron ' s net profits " with that number footnoted as a disguised figure . the other thing that would be very helpful would be again to provide some data on the profitability of operations in 1999 versus the profitability in 2000 when enron online became a dominant part of its activities . once again , we could include broad - level generalizations or disguised data . it ' s your choice , but it will give the students a sense of the size of the issue facing them . if it is helpful to talk about this in person , please feel free to call me on 617 - 495 - 6308 today ( thursday ) ; or tomorrow ( friday ) in the afternoon at 802 - 457 - 1880 . once again , thanks so much not only for the cooperation on the case , but also for the terrific organization you did in getting your executive team up here for last week ' s classes . i think you probably realized that it was a " home run " with the students , who are still talking about it . best wishes , chris

' ' enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 25 ( new york ) enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - trammell crow co . delayed construction of a $ 108 million office development in downtown houston , the first real estate project in the city to suffer the fallout from enron ' s financial troubles . trammell crow delayed groundbreaking on the planned 34 - story tower until at least next year , said leah rogers , a trammell crow spokeswoman . construction was to have started next week . ` ` given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty associated with the future availability of class ` a ' space springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to delay our construction start until future visibility improves , ' ' matt khourie , who heads trammell crow ' s houston development operations , said in a statement . enron , the largest u . s . energy trader , may have to file for bankruptcy protection and liquidate assets after dynegy inc . abandoned its proposed purchase of the company , investors and analysts said . with enron expected to give most of the 3 million square feet it occupies in houston , developers will have a harder time filling projects , forcing rental rates down , brokers said . about 2 million square feet of enron ' s space is in the city ' s downtown , where trammell crow ' s ballpark place project was planned . the project was to include apartments and retail space , and sit next to enron field , home to the major league baseball team houston astros , according to the houston chronicle , which reported the delay earlier . houston has 4 projects under construction , including a 40 - story , 1 . 17 - million - square - foot tower being built by enron next to its current headquarters . the projects are mainly being built for power companies , said peyton collins , head of property broker insignia / esg ' s houston office . ` ` the downtown market is 5 percent vacant and if you look five years out , with all the space that ' s coming in line , vacancy rates could double , ' ' said collins . other houston office projects underway include an 800 , 000 - square - foot building in which reliant resources will lease 550 , 000 square feet , and a 600 , 000 - square - foot tower , half of which will be occupied by calpine corp . , according to insignia . newpower has enough cash to run through 2 nd quarter ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 36 ( new york ) newpower has enough cash to run through 2 nd quarter ( updatel ) ( updates with financing details in second paragraph and enron ' s third - quarter loss on investments in sixth paragraph . ) purchase , new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings inc . , a venture formed by enron corp . to compete with traditional natural - gas and electric utilities , said it has enough cash and credit to run through the second quarter . the company is negotiating with lenders for $ 50 million for next year and another $ 50 million in 2003 , spokeswoman gael doar said . newpower , 44 percent owned by enron , may need money to buy gas for winter inventories next year , she said . newpower said a possible enron bankruptcy filing probably won ' t affect its earnings . the purchase , new york - based company said it can meet its credit obligations to enron and utilities and will continue to deliver to customers . newpower had 805 , 000 customers at the end of the third quarter and said it expects to have 840 , 000 to 860 , 000 by the end of the year . most electricity customers are in texas . georgia is its largest gas market , doar said . it also has business in ohio , pennsylvania and elsewhere . dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its bid for rival enron , once the biggest energy trader , after standard i ' m sure i can expect some of that sort of stuff but nothing yet today . i ' m sure they ' ve got other things to think about .

' ' clearing members are companies that guarantee transactions on the exchange , which trades energy and metals futures and options . the exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure obligations will be met . while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron , once the biggest gas trader . traders grew concerned that enron might be forced into bankruptcy . enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york ) enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say london , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s metals unit , one of the biggest traders on the london metal exchange , is close to being sold , its administrator said , an accord that would end an 18 - month foray into markets for copper and similar products . possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore international ag and the current management of the company , traders and analysts speculated . officials at the companies couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment . ` ` there is already very serious interest in enron ' s metal business , and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal ' ' soon , said tony lomas , a pricewaterhousecoopers administrator for enron in europe . ` ` our primary focus will be on the large physical assets and trading position of the group . ' ' traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said . enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445 million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation upon which that german construction , engineering and trading company was built . it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the direction of metals prices . declining market the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading operation . hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to meet demand from its customers . any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring dealer , or floor trader , on the lme . whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' ' the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid slowing economies . the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova scotia to leave the lme ring . the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive electronic trading . german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york ) german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about $ 100 million . deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount . europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below 100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman for deutsche bank . commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said . dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default , and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek . the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt . enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york ) enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in debt . enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week , must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products . a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets . ` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' ' duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of yesterday . in london , was appointed administrator of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter 11 papers in the u . s . enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value in the last six months . lawyers enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but declined to comment further . chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . thousands affected an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people , including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . recovery the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . shareholders enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors . ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit -

2	Subject: scheduling a meeting sally , dolores muzzy , celeste roberts ' assistant was attempting to schedule a meeting to discuss the commercial services program . the reason that dolores is trying to schedule a meeting is follows : ( 1 ) celeste and i were scheduled to speak briefly at rick ' s staff meeting on tuesday , april 11 th as we had at cliff baxter ' s on march 27 th . however , we were not going to have a significant amount of time and because the discussion may have been extensive , rick agreed that it made more sense to schedule a meeting in which the commercial services program was the sole topic of discussion . ( 2 ) you and i had exchanged voice mails on march 27 th , immediately after cliff ' s staff meeting where you indicated that you had a group of individuals who were involved in recruiting and who would like to meet with us regarding questions about the management of the program . you indicated that you would facilitate scheduling the meeting . however , given that i had not heard from you and celeste had told rick we would schedule a meeting , it seemed to make sense to combine the meetings since they would most probably include some of the same individuals and cover the same questions . i have no problem with you facilitating the scheduling of the meeting as you expressed to dolores . however , given that we told rick that we would schedule a meeting , we are just trying to make sure that it does not slip through the cracks . we will attempt to be available whenever it is convenient for you and the group that you wish to pull together . if you wish to schedule a meeting immediately , our availability is as follows : friday , april 14 th from 2 : 00 - 5 : 00 p . m . monday , april 17 th from 9 : 30 - 11 : 30 a . m . tuesday , april 18 th from 9 : 00 - 11 : 00 a . m . or 2 : 30 p . m . - 5 : 00 p . m . wednesday , april 19 th from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 a . m . if these dates don ' t work please don ' t hesitate to suggest others . we look forward to meeting with you . thanks charlene p . s . my schedule gets pretty crazy so if you could let me know as soon as possible what date works for you i can be sure to hold the time . thanks .

2	Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all , i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : - 1 ) use less data unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately . conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ] and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue . the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used ) . the three new equations developed were : - pllu ( t )  a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16 [ reddish curves ] r - squared approx 0 . 49 f - stat approx 32 the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpi : pllu ( t )  a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16 [ greenish curves ] r - squared approx 0 . 47 f - stat approx 45 comparison of models as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months . the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 ( which we don ' t ) . suggestion what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets . back - testing all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s " new paradigm " economy ) . hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ; your ideas on this would be appreciated . regards , anjam x 35383

( there was actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to " bounce " the server twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance . the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the behavior is a " feature " or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types of changes at night during scheduled outages . i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again . if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a call . dave n .

2	Subject: god bless you dr . nkem george . bank of the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria . my dear friend , i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria . i have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality . on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred united states dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine notification in accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , we found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a security company in europe for safekeeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it and according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and half years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6 million u . s dollars that is presently in a security company in europe . i contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the money in the security company in europe . we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum would be for you if you agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay back the expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has been claimed and lodged in your account . in the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction , the following information would be needed from you to expedite action . 1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund . this would ensure that the security company in europe releases the consignment / fund to you . 2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where you can be reached at all time because this transaction entails constant communication . the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested , send the requested information via email i await your response urgently . regards , dr . nkem george . .

2	Subject: energy finance critiques david , here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested : from jennifer martinez ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) : the energy finance program 2 years ago was very good , especially considering it was the first year of the program . there were a lot of guest speakers from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge about the energy industry through case studies , lectures , etc . basically , we learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance classes , but all the cases and examples were energy - related . the professors were good for the most part but didn ' t have a great deal of practical industry experience . if i had to guess the reason for decreased participation in the program , i would probably say it is the professors . ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and quantitative . some students prefer less technical professors and classes that aren ' t limiting to the energy industry . also , the fact that the class meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing . other than those things , i can ' t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment . i especially don ' t understand why every single person didn ' t drop for enron . i wonder if it has something to do with international status . ? ? ? from john massey ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) : bottom line - ut business schools is great - investment fund - best activity available to students energy finance program - fairly weak - it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a weak finance appendage - the finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher , ignorant about industry specific analysis , devoid of industry experience , rude to outside lectures ( from industry ) keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small portion of the class time - way to make better : get teachers with practical industry experience - make it a seminar class - focus on case studies , lectures - given by people from industry - promote the class within the business school - i felt like ut did a poor job of internally ( to students ) promoting the class - - - - - - - - - - - - from ross mesquita ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) : to be honest , a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific . when energy applications were presented , it seemed more like general finance questions were reworded to include energy lingo . we had some very good speakers , but for the most part , i did not feel like the 6 hours of class had enough energy focus . i assumed that this would get better as the program progressed . one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy finance is a very specific focus . i would have probably not enrolled in the energy finance program had it been available in my first year . i did not know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b - school to consider several career options - - i . e . , investment banking , corporate finance , entrepreneurship , marketing , etc . as a new mba student , i would not want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies . here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas - - my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa . - - - - - - - - - - from billy braddock ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) : i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of 1998 . the primary positives to the class revolved around outside panels / instruction . for example , enron sent representatives on 2 separate occasions to discuss particular topics ( vince kaminski and gary hickerson ) . other notable speakers were jeff sandefer ( independent business consultant and e & p professional ) , the beacon group , and encap investments . another good speaker was a professor from ut ' s school of engineering . he brought a good perspective as to the " basics " of the energy business . the class was structured via a team - based instruction approach , with 3 professors team - teaching a 6 - hour credit course . none of the 3 professors had any product knowledge of the energy business . of the 3 professors , 2 were research focussed / tenured with little credibility in " teaching . " one of the professors primary focus of research was fixed income , while the other 2 were investments and corporate finance , respectively . as is the case for ut ' s finance program in general , and energy finance in particular , ut is in dire need of teaching professors ( as opposed to research professors ) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a finance background . particular to the energy program , ut needs to have more instruction from energy professionals ( such as the instructors used for enron ' s internal learning programs ( ie . derivatives classes , etc . ) . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from bryan williams ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) : i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of 1998 , at the university of texas . the curriculum was understandably  & rough around the edges  8 as 1998 was the first year the energy finance course was offered . however , the instruction also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak of ( the 6 - credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors ) . two of the three professors have co - authored textbooks , and the third professor  , s claim to fame is fixed income . as a group , the three professors are research - heavy ( as opposed to industry focused ) , and the team - teaching format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for the success of the class . that said , the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside speakers . among them : vince kaminski & gary hickerson , both of enron . they also dedicated one class period to a video conference call with the beacon group , an energy consulting group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman . jeff sandefer , an independent businessman , an entreprenuership instructor , and one of the foremost experts in the e - there are some experienced , brand - name professors ( e . g . sheridan titman ) teaching in the program ; cons : - the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies such as enron . specifically , it might need to help students link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron ; from george huan ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken fall of 1999 ) : companies expect mba students to have both general management ( new ideas ) and analytic ( quantative ) skills . energy industry is no exception . energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courses which fit in the insudtry need . however , these two courses are far from enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitements and opportunities in this industry . other management and quantitive courses are needed to complete this program . my suggestions : 1 ) seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies . before students make their decisions , let them know : what ' s happening and what ' s going to happen in this industry ; what the companies are doing now ; who they are looking for . 2 ) management and / or analytical courses should be included . such as : strategy , financial enginering and real option . 3 ) more industry connections . presentations and discussions . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from charlie weldon ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken in fall of 1999 ) my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive experience . the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers brought in during dr . titman ' s portion of the class . this part of the course is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~ 10 case classes all focusing on the energy industry . two of the cases were based on enron , and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate and well thought out . value added by the professor was less than from the speakers and cases . the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options . nearly all of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student ' s understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market . the use of options and futures for speculating and / or hedging was stressed on numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project . i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvements to the program . however , i do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement . there is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron . the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical , due in large part to their background . while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding the basics , the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course . until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience , i believe the energy finance program will continue to underdeliver on its objectives . additionally , i believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive hours of classroom instruction .

2	Subject: california update 4 / 05 / 01 below is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with state treasurer phil angelides : summary : ? bond issuance to be $ 10 b with 10 - 15 year term , 70 % tax exempt and 30 % non - exempt ? angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax ? opposed to current discussion between davis and socal in regards to socal paying off the generators over 12 years with a 2 - year grace period what decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds ? " the big things we need are that the puc must enter into agreement with dwr , essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be available for purchasing power . it is really their job to define what each party needs to pay for power . we need to give assurance to the investment community that whatever the overall rate is , the state will get enough to pay its bonds . however , if the utilities challenge the decision , it could stall the bond issuance . " what do you think will be the size of the first bond issue ? " based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorized , around $ 10 bn . the puc has allowed us to sell north of $ 13 bn , but we anticipate that $ 10 bn is absorbable . until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and what it needs in terms of funding , what will drive it is that number , not what the puc has said . the issuance may well be a single $ 10 bn issue or a series of smaller ones done together , e . g . $ 3 bn each 3 weeks apart . " what is the total size of the market for ca tax - exempt bonds ? " what we do normally is $ 5 - 10 bn in bonds for various revenues or general obligations . in 1997 the ca infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $ 7 bn issuance , and this was handled well . this is not exclusively a ca market . around $ 200 bn of these bonds is sold each year . we anticipate that the bonds will be 70 % tax - exempt and 30 % non - exempt . " what is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to require funding ? " we have estimates . the dwr is buying power , and let ' s say power costs $ 100 and its portion of rates is $ 70 . this bond issuance covers the diff between $ 100 and $ 70 . so , the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap . however , if power prices do not come down , you cannot keep borrowing . if we issue more than $ 10 bn in bonds , i have to see the whole financial plan . ( the implication is that he will not keep this plan secret . ) " what will be the term mix of the bond issues ? " overall term is expected to be in the 10 - 15 year range . i do not know the mix . " do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything like that to take care of the general fund ? " the very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and tax - exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued . in order for us to issue bonds , a number of steps have to occur . i would hope that the puc and dwr do what they have to do realistically by june . then the bond issuance would come semi all - at - once . ( in other words , either all at once , or something like $ 3 billion every three weeks . ) " are all of the general funds ' assets in cash , or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable ? " we have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund . we have a cash flow . we have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can go out to five years . we have $ 40 bn - plus in that account . " what is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for day - to - day operations ? " it depends , and goes up and down . on any given day we are doing on the order of $ 500 mm . there is a $ 100 bn budget between the general funds and special fund . " are you discussing the dwr contracting in relation to the required funding ? do you have a veto on the deals struck ? " this is all in the administration ' s court . what we have asked for is the information . we have asked for this today by letter . we have to move from working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering , which means public disclosure . the general fund has been making advances to buy power , but we want to get out of that business and to stop the $ 4 bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan . " what is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking or self - selecting ? " there are limits on the options out there . ablx has limited the ability of people to opt out of the system . if you do allow them to opt out , what do they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream ? the agreement between the dwr and the puc will say that , through a financing order , we will get you the revenue to service the bonds , even if it adjusts rates . this will be a covenant that the money will be made available . " if an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an effect on abix or the bond issuance ? what about " harvey proofing " ? what is the direct state participation ? " the state ' s role is infrastructure and economic development . bonds will be issued in name of dwr only to pay for power the state is buying , not to repay utility deb . i don ' t think the state will repay utility debt . the state can buy power in or out of chapter 11 . there will be no participation by the state bank . i know harvey well , and he and i agree on a number of things . for example , i am cosponsoring the public power authority . we should not put the state in the business of refinancing utility debt . i don ' t think most consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for power . i very much want , and it is in my interest , to repay the general fund . at the same time that this office is financing the purchase of energy , the fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generators - the ransom that is being demanded by the generators . i agree with harvey that as of this current time the generators are winning . we will have to consider excess profits taxes , or if the generators continue , they have increased their prices tenfold . the generators they bought a set of plants for $ 3 . 1 bn . since january the state has spent over $ 4 bn . if the generators don ' t take their foot off our throat , they may leave us no option but to take back plants under emergency power . so let them justify those rates . what causes the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where they will make us do something about it . " what is the " measurable size premium " that will have to be paid based on the most current estimates of bond issue size ? " measurable is the wrong choice of words . we don ' t know how many basis points . if it is more than $ 10 bn , we will begin to feel it . also , i am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the generators over 12 years with a 2 - year grace period . they should work that out themselves , not on the backs of ratepayers . the perspective here is that they did very , very well in 1996 , 97 and 98 . they upstreamed billions .

" the market is really shrugging off this news , " said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front " looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , " mr . kroll said . " i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . " although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . " the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , " said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be " difficult . " companies " are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , " said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as " double witching . " one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ?

2	Subject: california update - - 07 . 20 . 01 having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues , the legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend , at a minimum . in sum , though many claim that the legislature will " vote for something , " it still doesn ' t appear that the " something " will include a measure that will keep edison out of bankruptcy . the senate and assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the governor ' s original mou ( which is dead ) . the ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing . in the senate : sbl 8 xx - - - bill to de - link the bonds from the dwr contracts in the only bipartisan move to date , sbl 8 xx passed out of two committees yesterday , but has not yet been voted on by the full senate . the bill de - links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of dwr contracts . the bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the dwr contracts . the dwr contracts are being held up as the reason california must suspend , or end , direct access . republicans on the assembly side are supportive of 18 , but hertzberg - - the speaker - - has joined with the governor ' s people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts , consititute a breach , and expose the state to substantial damages . as a result , when the bill passes the senate and gets over to the assembly , its chances of passage there are low . sb 72 xx - - - the senate ' s mou the senate ' s version of the mou - - sb 72 xx - - limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full senate , but its chances of passing the full senate at this point are 50 - 50 . the problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive edison into bankruptcy , while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out edison - - - - the courage and leadership is awesome . in the assembly : the assembly two versions of the mou - - - ab 82 xx and ab 83 xx ( now ab 50 xx ) the assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue . the speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill ( 82 xx ) . many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat ( rod wright ) , who has broken ranks with repbublicans , and assembly republicans . in the end , the speaker ' s bill is likely to prevail . things are complicated by the fact that the assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed . as noted above , the assembly democractic leadership opposes sb 18 xx and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18 .

( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris

2	Subject: please help dear sir / madam as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is atonio fernando a merchant in phillipines , i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million united states dollars that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside twenty percent for you and for your time . god be with you . regards atonio fernando

2	Subject: midmonth report : early warning - cera alert note : the following was sent out by cera and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing . note the price differential forecasts by basin . cera alert : sent wed , november 15 , 2000 title : midmonth report : early warning author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u  5526 likewise , a 5 percent warmer - than - normal scenario could decrease demand by 1 . 7 bcf per day relative to normal weather . fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight , there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market . residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run , which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market . this winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 mmcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices , as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of 4 . 5 bcf per day relative to last december and a 14 . 4 bcf per day increase in demand relative to november , with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching . supply - the rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense , but us supply is beginning to rebound . the recent steep decline in us lower - 48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000 , given the soaring gas - related rig count . * the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp - up of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf , adding to the recent startup of the muni field ; these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera ' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month ' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year ' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal " freeze - up , " which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the " commercial " in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

2	Subject: escrow affiliate - part - time work at home opportunity baltia capital investment ltd . , the leading private equity investor in the baltic states , offers you an opportunity to join our team on a position of escrow affiliate . this home - based job does not require any in - depth knowledge of finance or a great investment of time . if you believe that you are an orderly and responsible person with some multi - task skills , this is a great opportunity for you to get a substantial additional income without much effort . looks like another work - by - email scam ? read on to find out why it is not . about us baltia capital investment was founded in 1995 to provide exciting investment opportunities to institutions and individuals who believed in the potential of the emerging markets of baltic states and former soviet union countries . over the years , the performance of our funds remained ahead of the expectations of our investors , and we have built a healthy reputation in the eastern european investment market . we are now looking at establishing local presence in the us and canada , where household investors grow dissatisfied with the financial market performance and standard investment vehicles . we are eager to offer private equity opportunities that combine our investment expertise and the amazing potential of the emerging markets . however , there is a major obstacle on our way : the 2001 patriot act . the grievous events of the september 2001 were not only a display of great villainess of the islamic fundamentalism , but also a catalyst for the us market being effectively barred for the new european financial companies . if you would like to learn more about our company , please feel free to visit us online at www . baltiacapital . com . how you can help at the moment , us patriot act forbids international clients to hold bank accounts in the us banks . all investment transactions made to eastern european and baltic companies by individuals are also subject to great and often unnecessary scrutiny , which brings a lot of inconvenience both to investment companies and their clients . as a small company working on a highly competitive market , we do not want to load our american clients , who are chiefly private , not - so - affluent investors with the additional expense associated with the upkeep of a duly registered us office . that is why we are looking for escrow agents in the usa and canada who will be able to receive the electronic bank payments on behalf of our company and forward the funds to our client account , retaining an escrow commission . what you will need to do as soon as you join our team , you will be assigned an online cabinet in our corporate website employee section . there you will be able to trace all payments made to your designated account for further transfer to the designated client investment account . you will also see the amount of the commission due to you , calculated on the basis of your experience of successful cooperation with our company . all you questions will be handled by your individual supervisor . your reward your escrow commission is calculated on the following table : amount transferred , total commission rate $ 50 , 000 - $ 150 , 000 12 , 5 % $ 150 , 000 - $ 500 , 000 15 % $ 500 , 000 and over 20 % your escrow commission is deducted directly from the amount that you receive for further transfer . that means that you do not have to wait till the end of the month to receive your reward . instead , you receive the commission as soon as you transfer the money to the client investment account . example jill escrow joins our company and receives a $ 35 , 000 payment from john investor on the first week . her commission constitutes 10 % x $ 35 , 000  $ 3500 . she retains this amount and forwards the remaining $ 31 , 500 to the client investment account . next week , she receives a $ 20 , 000 . her commission equals 10 % x $ 15 , 000 + 12 , 5 % x $ 5 , 000  $ 2125 . whats next if you are tempted by the offer , feel free to email a brief resume to escrowprogram @ baltiacapital . com , and a hr manager will be in touch with you shortly .

2	Subject: re : replacement cost values the 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $ 670 , 000 based upon ena ' s 2001 reported value of approximately $ 470 , 000 , 000 . the pro - rata credit for 7 months , assuming a 5 - 31 - 01 sale date , would be $ 390 , 833 . underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal . gathering these values within enron normally requires 30 to 45 days . we use these same values in the allocation system . unless the value change is significant , the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values , we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted . if we internally adjust your allocation mid - year , we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program . as you know , the remainder of enron did not stand still while you sold bammel . we have not tried this before , however , i suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ena ' s allocation , all the other operating entities would want to re - submit their revised values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment . in view of the time required , this is neither practical nor cost effective for enron . in view of the relatively small numbers , i doubt that corp . would entertain this proposition either , however , we can approach them if you wish . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : redmond , brian sent : tuesday , october 09 , 2001 9 : 26 am to : clayton , paul ; coffey jr . , jim ; azore , jacquelyn cc : whiting , greg ; gruesen , karen ; helton , susan ; koehler , anne c . ; kitchen , louise ; bouillion , james l . subject : re : replacement cost values paul : please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx . $ 700 mm of hpl assets . this charge is effectively " a cost of capital " and should be re - allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at corp . regards , brian - - - - - original message - - - - - from : clayton , paul sent : tuesday , october 09 , 2001 8 : 43 am to : redmond , brian ; coffey jr . , jim ; azore , jacquelyn cc : whiting , greg ; gruesen , karen ; helton , susan ; koehler , anne c . ; kitchen , louise ; bouillion , james l . subject : re : replacement cost values brian : this insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage . values are adjusted annually at renewal . the premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds . in the event that we discontinue premiums to north america for hlp , we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured . in the event of a significant divestiture , underwriters may consider a refund , however , the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to enron ' s values as a whole . additionally , enron ' s adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures . at renewal , 4 / 01 / 02 , north america ' s revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of enron ' s overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of enron . regards , paul - - - - - original message - - - - - from : redmond , brian sent : monday , october 08 , 2001 5 : 31 pm to : coffey jr . , jim ; clayton , paul ; azore , jacquelyn cc : whiting , greg ; gruesen , karen ; helton , susan ; koehler , anne c . ; kitchen , louise subject : re : replacement cost values paul : please confirm that ena will not bear any insurance costs for the hpl assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward ?

this is to your advantage ! web sitetfacts remember " the yellow pages " rule ! a searchtengine is like an enormous " yellow pages " with thousands of companies advertising the same product . unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote . unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move you to the front and also get you on all of the " yellow pages " in thetworld . what does it take to be seen on the searchtengines ? appreciate the three golden rules q searchrengines do not pull up the webtsites at random they use a specific method of search . those that know them are the ones at the top , those that do not are buried at the bottom ! q your webisite must be submitted to the searchtengines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off ( its a bit like a ferris wheel , you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on ) . q understand the importance oftkeywords , meta tags , and titles employed whenysubmitting your site to the search engines !

2	Subject: meeting with energy secretary martens i had an hour long , fruitful meeting with energy secretary martens last night . he was very supportive of our import project for industrials but , i did not convince him on the concept of cfe ' s bids ( i . e . rio bravo iv ) to be modified , so as to call for ipp or ppa ' s ( imported power ) indifferently . he gave me two solid arguments : - cfe ( i . e . mexico ) cannot depend on imported power from the us ( texas ) on a long term basis ( 25 years ) , since there is no formal agreement between both countries that will support it . this is an even stronger argument after the september 11 th events , when the us can call for national emergencies whenever needed . secretary martens shared with me the problems they faced in baja california during the california energy crisis , when natural gas supply was cut out , on three or four occasions , because of a state government emergency decree ( i . e . supply contracts between sdge and cfe were not honored ) . - we are very late to request modifications on the rio bravo iv bid , which has been postponed for early december . he offered to look into it for 2002 bids , providing the bilateral agreement is in place . regarding the import project for industrials , he volunteered his support with tamsa , axa , desc or deacero , since the concept of importing / trading power in the ercot market , is a good story for him to sell . finally , he told me that the transmission cost methodology will be available by the end of this month ( he hopes that the cre will load it in its internet site ) . regards , jaime _ _ _ _ _ _ _

2	Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc craig and kim , as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc . you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc . well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc . we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office . we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties . more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties : fiscal year the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) . cash & equivalents this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities . inventory inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs . current assets this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets . total assets total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies . current liabilities liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities . total liabilities this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) . retained earnings retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies . sales this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers . cost of goods sold entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies . ebit earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income . interest expense this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is : interest expense  0 . 07 * total liabilities . net income this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian companies . extraordinary items positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses , income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for australian companies . country this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia . we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc . thanks , iris

" their share price hasn ' t been bulletproof and that ' s what counts . they were up pushing $ 90 and they ' re now in the $ 50 s while the energy sector has done quite well , so they have underperformed quite a bit and that doesn ' t seem bulletproof to me , " analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said . meade said the price fall came as investors took the bad news out of enron ' s valuation , particularly in devaluing the broadband business . " with broadband the market initially gave them full credit . but investors got smart over the next year , and once you got some bad news out there , you could argue that valuation was pulled , " meade said . but the bad news neither starts nor ends there . the latest negative item came wednesday , when a california federal judge ordered enron to return the university of california and california state university systems to direct power access , which enron says will cost them $ 12 million a month . the universities ' lawsuit which claimed enron energy services breached their power management contract , could cast a shadow over the houston - based company ' s power risk management arm which recently saw a huge upsurge in business involving similar multimillion dollar deals with large corporations . other bad news includes broadband layoff talk , failed water company spinoff azurix inc . ' s impending sell - off its north american assets , the failure of the video on demand deal with blockbuster , word that the $ 2 billion sale of utility portland general is unlikely to go through and continuing payment problems at the dabhol power plant in india . that long - running dispute in india reared its head again on monday . enron confirmed it issued a notice of political force majeure to the maharashstra state electricity board ( mseb ) , which has consistently defaulted on payments . force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual party that could not have been prevented . " it ' s one of the steps in the process of protecting our rights . it ' s one step , but it ' s not the only step , " enron spokesman john ambler said . enron has already invoked payment guarantees from the indian national government , but it has refused to cover mseb ' s $ 21 . 9 million december bill until enron and mseb settle another dispute over a fine . the mseb wants the $ 85 . 8 million fine , which it levied , to cover its outstanding bills . layoffs or redeployments ? another nettling problem for enron is news of trouble at enron broadband services ( ebs ) , the cutting - edge unit that encompasses a nascent bandwidth trading operation and a broadband content services business . most recently , enron has had to answer questions about a reduction in the number of employees at ebs because of the stock market ' s faltering confidence in telecoms generally . two weeks ago , the company characterized word of layoffs at the broadband unit as nothing more than an internal redeployment of staff to areas that were growing at a higher rate . " it ' s word games . initially they said they were redeploying , and that was not the word i heard from inside the company , but that was the way they put it . it ' s probably a little of both , " said analyst john olson of houston investment house sanders morris harris . ebs spokeswoman kelly kimberly on monday said 227 employees were leaving the broadband unit to work in other areas of the company . " most of them have elected to go into the redeployment pool or are already moved into corporate or another business , " kimberly said . kimberly did not have an exact figure on the number who have opted to take a severance package , but characterized it as a small percentage . it has been a rough few weeks for ebs , which also suffered from the blockbuster debacle . last month , the two announced a mutual end to a 20 - year exclusive video on - demand deal , which had been considered a cornerstone of ebs ' content services push . folder name : rahil jafry relevance score on scale of 100 : 79 to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

2	Subject: proposed decision the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good readers digest version of the order . susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and mark baldwin yesterday , and the consensus of those conversations was that transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementation / documentation . jeff offered that he might send a letter to governor gray ' s office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpuc didn ' t complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to california ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved . he may ask the other comprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter . susan , mark and i spoke about this idea later , and we ' ve got some reservations about tw ' s role in admonishing the cpuc . we should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything . bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state , california public utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gas  , ( socal ) system . in his draft decision , bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundling of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case , the less far - reaching interim settlement ( is ) , submitted in december 1999 . socal , san diego gas and electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is , reaching a comprehensive agreement in april this year . but since then , gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state , prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name . the draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements . recent events  & lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation , the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm , tradable intrastate transmission rights , should be delayed ,  8 according to the draft order .  & this unbundling is the basis of the [ comprehensive settlement ] and we cannot approve it . we do not , however , wish to commit to paralysis until 2006 , as the [ post - interim settlement ] would have us do . accordingly , we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption , with modifications , of the is .  8 the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge , calif . , with rolled - in rates if certain criteria are met . el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed socal to automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of curtailments oc - curred . el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheeler when only certain customers would benefit . the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridge expansion , but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process . the draft decision would also :   end socal  , s current    establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations ;   institute an operational flow order ( ofo ) procedure . provides a forum for more changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made ;   set up    make changes to balancing rules , while retaining the current 10 % monthly imbalance tolerance ;   make socal  , s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rules and penalties as all other shippers ;   allow some limited imbalances trading , as well as the right to assign and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market , with a socal electronic bulletin board set up for it ;   unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceeding that required for core minimum reliability ; and   provide for rate recovery of up to $ 3 . 5 million in implementation costs . in addition , the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates , eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges , eliminate the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs . the threshold for participating in core aggregation is reduced , and billing options are offered to core aggregators . bilas  , draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition , taking into account any changes in market conditions . bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft .  we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers if more competition is allowed ,  8 bilas wrote in the draft decision .  & with half the state already committed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry , it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re - structuring to enhance competition are speculative , particularly at this time . with one leg in the water , the current has switched direction and it will be difficult , if not foolhardy , to reach our goals by forging ahead .  & we choose to take a cautious approach again ,  8 the draft continues .  & rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now , we approve , with modifications , the settle - ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market . additionally , we unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumer protection legisla - tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs .  8 the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc - turing in the future  & but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers .  8 all drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be discussed . the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpuc  , s dec . 21 meeting .

" there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) , will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ? the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology . 3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail . the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the distribution of load looks like . i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe in the form of a talk here at enron . again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again soon . stinson nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com subject : stanford project hello vince and stinson , first of all , best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! ! if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together some time to have dinner . i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial ! we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into the " problem / opportunity generation environment . " that really helps the student to develop a realistic vision about their research . perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter , say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of course you could visit us before that too . with my warmest wishes , nick

2	Subject: cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000 title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update e - mail category : cera monthly briefing cera knowledge area : world oil in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 . the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect . cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output . iraq in a twilight zone as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled " oil for food " program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . * iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyers . although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown , iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about 1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean . exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market . iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6 and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to iraq . how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to cease exports from mina al - bakr again . there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook . iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to " reenergize " sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote . demand trends record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so , and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil , so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition . switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season . other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching . some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil . supply trends non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended . norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . * growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 . cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1 mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to 1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5 mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un authorization and are continuing . oil stocks us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels . primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ; at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year . in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent years ( see figure 3 ) . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 -

2	Subject: reply soon ! ! ! dear sir , i know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business . it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and assistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i am dr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria ) who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children , hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband . i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . having noted the confidence reposed on your person , i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general ( my husband ) . this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons . it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf . on your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact , the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband . in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars . in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur ( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal . i look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co - operation . in view of all above details , i request you to keep this letter and co - operation highly confidential . best wishes , mrs . mariam abacha .

2	Subject: my model for spikes dear dr . kaminski , i was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that i recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power . in this regard , i have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the center for energy finance education and research and the institute for computational finance at the ut austin . right now i am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint . please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint . i look forward to hearing from you . sincerely yours , valery kholodnyi manager of quantitative analysis research and analytics group txu energy trading ps . here are the main preprints that i have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power : 1 . valery a . kholodnyi , the stochastic process for power prices with spikes and valuation of european contingent claims on power , preprint , txu - rag - 01 / 00 , july 2000 . 2 . valery a . khlolodnyi , valuation of a swing option on power with spikes , preprint txu - rag - 05 / 00 , august , 2000 . 3 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a spark spread option on power with spikes , preprint txu - rag - 21 / 00 , november 2000 . 4 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of european contingent claims on power at two distinct points on the grid with spikes in both power prices , preprint txu - rag - 24 / 00 , november 2000 . 5 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a transmission option on power with spikes , preprint txu - rag - 25 / 00 , november 2000 . as i have indicated to you in my previous e - mail , contrary to the standard approaches , i model spikes directly , as self - reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes . in this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non - markovian process , even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is markovian . among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes , provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes .

2	Subject: reply me urgently mr steve williams tel : + 27 - 73 - 918 - 1010 fax : + 27 - 11 - 507 - 5397 strictly confidential . attention : director , you may be surprised to receive this message from me since you don ' t know me in person , but for the purpose of introduction , i am steve williams , the son of late mr . michael williams , who was murdered in a land dispute in zimbabwe . you contact was given to me at the south africa exchange network on line here in johannesburg as reliable and trustworthy to deal with , and then i decided to write you . my late father was among the few black zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for zimbabwean opposition party . which we communicated to the whole world through bbc and cnn . before the death of my father , he took me to south africa to deposit the sum of twenty million us dollars ( $ 20 m ) with a security and finance company , as if he knew the looming danger in zimbabwe . the money was deposited as a gem or precious stone to avoid much demurrage from the security firm . this money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . this land problem arose when president r . mugabe introduced a new land act . which wholly affects the white rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the ' modus operandi ' adopted by the government . this resulted to rampant killing and mob actions . i and my family who are currently staying in south africa as a refugee or an asylum seeker have decided to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can invest it . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same political history . moreover , the south african monetary policy / law does not allow such investment hence i am seeking for an asylum or refugee . i must let you know that this business is 100 % risk free and the nature of your business does not necessary matter . so if you are willing to assist us , i and my family have agreed to give you 20 % of the total money , 40 % will be for a joint business venture i will be doing with you and another 35 % will be for me and my family which we shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5 % will be mapped out for all expenses we may incurred during the transaction . therefore , if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance , endeavour to reply through the above tel / fax no . i also need your private phone and fax number for easy communication . remember that this is highly confidential and the success of this business depends on how secret it is kept . expecting your reply soonest . best regards . mr steve williams ( for the family )

2	Subject: clickpaper . com confirming entity discussions over the last several days with legal and tax have resulted in a change to the legal entity we ' ll use for the " trading " portion of clickpaper . com activity . as long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is . . . . . . a . for click match activity clickpaper . com can still be used as planned . simply , we ' ll only be invoicing for transaction fees . b . for click trade activity the following will happen . 1 . physical trading that occurs at any north american hub developed by clickpaper . com , enron north america , corp . ( ena ) will be the confirming entity . i have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as a " clickpaper . com on - line transaction " . 2 . physical trading that occurs at any hub developed for the u . k . , latin america , or asia , has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes . my desire is that we follow the legal entity structure used by eol on - line trading for hubs in similar countries . we ' ll work that out soon . strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most significant is a much simplified mid / back - office effort in order to support clickpaper on - line business . we no longer need to be concerned about setting up more portfolio / book i . d . ' s for risk books as on - line deals can go into the same risk books used today for pulp and paper . intercompany transactions between clickpaper . com and ena are now eliminated for on - line trades which simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial reporting / reconcilation activity that would be required by using clickpaper . com as the entity . if our one to many model is successful , we move to a many to many model . at that point , all of this changes . so for now , enjoy ! for now , jeff harbert

2	Subject: please use this money for charity only dear friend , as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is ahmed raheem , a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with lung cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have onlyabout a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the onlything i cared for . but now i regret all this as now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan ; they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money , which no one knows of , is the cash deposit of ten million five hundredus dollarus ( $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) , that i have with a security company abroad . acknowledge this mail so that i can introduce you to my lawyer who will handle the transfer of receivership by you of the said funds . i will want you to help me collect this deposit cash and use it for charity organizations only . thanks . god be with you ahmed raheem

2	Subject: western update 5 / 7 / 01 executive summary ? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell . ? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government . ? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire ? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable liberal party platform ? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada ? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence ? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality ? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax . energy agenda according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , " an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . " a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . " these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . " campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position . should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change . electricity export policy currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire . bc hydro privatization a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , " we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . " he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . " i want to change that big time , " he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants . campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , " we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . " liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition . however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review . bc hydro williston generation current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash .
