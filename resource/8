[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .

2	Subject: lincoln electric louise , i understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the lincoln electric sales agreement to oppd is not sufficient to justify paying $ 1 . 3 million to oppd in order for them to assume this contract . there are some considerations on this contract which i think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you : - the original sales contract to lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as " toxic waste " . - about a month ago , we agreed verbally with oppd to accept assignment of the sales contract , as oppd is one of the few parties which can serve it . - the execution of the documents has been delayed by lincoln , who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment - we have another , larger under - water transaction with oppd which we would like to move off the books at some point . we ' d like to keep oppd happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them ) - if we fail to deliver , we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $ 45 , 0000 per mw on top of liquidated damages ( lincoln is 15 mw for 02 and 30 mw for 03 ) . - this is a highly constrained area ( only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and oppd is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve lincoln ) : the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high . - there is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where enron fails to deliver . - even if we do wind up serving the contract , the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire . - trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve ( day - ahead notice on 20 % monthly load factor ) obviously , if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now , then we will smooth things as much as possible with oppd - but i wanted to make sure you had all the info . before we kill the deal . terri has stalled oppd until monday . dave

( ene ) , an ice press release said tuesday , without mentioning enron by name . investors have been watching to see if enron ' s trading partners in its core business - north american gas and power marketing - significantly reduce activities with the financially troubled top energy marketer . ice is considered a primary alternative to enron ' s internet - based commodities market , enrononline . ice ' s volume of north american bulk power trades last week totaled a record 54 million megawatt - hours , a 34 % increase over the october weekly average . north american natural gas volumes rose 13 % from october to 950 billion cubic feet last week . oil trading rose 45 % to a record 55 million barrels , and metals trading volumes was up 66 % . " we believe that this has resulted , in part , from the uncertainty that has been exhibited in several key energy trading venues over the pas several months , " said ice chief executive , jeffry sprecher . enrononline is different from ice because enrononline is a mechanism for companies to buy from , and sell to , enron . ice is a neutral multiparty exchange , allowing energy trading companies to trade with all other members . ice ' s trading system , which has been installed in 7 , 000 desktops worldwide , covers 600 commodity and derivative contract types . ice also owns the international petroleum exchange of london , europe ' s largest energy futures exchange . ice is owned by companies including american electric power ( aep ) , aquila energy ( ila ) , bp amoco plc ( bp ) , deutshe bank ag ( g . dbk ) , el paso corp .

' s ( pge ) securities as follows : senior secured debt to ' bbb + ' from ' a ' ; senior unsecured debt to ' bbb ' from ' a - ' ; preferred stock to ' bbb - ' from ' bbb + ' . the rating watch status has been revised to evolving from negative for all intermediate - to long - term securities . a rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised , lowered or maintained . pge ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ' f 2 ' from ' fl ' , with a stable outlook . the downgrades for pge reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent , enron ( ene ) . ene ' s senior unsecured debt is rated ' bbb - ' , with a rating watch evolving . ene ' s financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a result of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structured transactions . on oct . 16 , 2001 , ene announced a $ 1 billion after tax charge to third quarter 2001 earnings and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction to balance sheet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions . in addition , the company has restated its financial results for the 1997 - 2000 period , incorporating off - balance sheet entries related to the structured transactions and is the subject of a securities and exchange commission ( sec ) investigation focusing on the company ' s accounting for the partnerships . these events badly eroded investor confidence in the company , effectively blocking its ability to access capital markets , and forcing management to seek a corporate suitor . on nov . 9 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire ene in a stock - for - stock transaction under which ene shareholders will receive a fixed amount of dyn shares . the proposed dyn transaction will provide significant financial support to ene , and should enable ene to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expected business conditions , despite ene ' s significant refinancing risk . the merger requires regulatory approvals , including hart - scott - rodino , the sec , and the federal regulatory energy commission ; assuming regulators approve the merger , we would expect the transaction to close in six - to nine - months . the merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an element of uncertainty to its completion . fitch anticipates that the surviving company ' s rating would move to the mid - ' bbb ' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the completion of the merger . if the merger were terminated fitch believes ene ' s ability to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to highly speculative levels . pge ' s new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile , the prospective regulatory ring - fencing required by oregon regulators , and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas ( nwn ) , in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene . the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene / dyn merger were terminated , or improve , if ene ' s credit rating is upgraded in the future . pge ' s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in 2001 , reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs . in august 2001 , the oregon public utility commission ( opuc ) authorized higher pge rates , effective october 1 , 2001 , to recover such costs . importantly , the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion ' s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future . the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order , combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in 2002 . the pge ratings consider fitch ' s assessment of nwn ' s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post - merger holding company structure . nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at $ 2 . 9 billion , including the assumption of $ 1 . 1 billion of pge debt . the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory approvals , including the sec , the opuc , and the washington utilities and transportation commission . as part of the transaction , nwn expects to form a new holding company ( holdco ) , which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge . post - merger , pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco . as currently contemplated , the approximate $ 1 . 8 billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately 78 % debt and 22 % common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock . as a result , holdco ' s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak , as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach 75 % at closing . pge ' s ultimate post - merger ratings will depend on several factors , including , the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn , the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco , and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators . the current regulatory ring - fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a 48 % common equity ratio , thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company . it is expected that similar ring - fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure . contact : fitch , new york philip smyth , 1 -

sized natural gas pipeline company , created in 1986 in the merger of houston natural gas and internorth , to the world ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . enron ' s market capitalization has fallen almost $ 19 billion in just the the past month as investor confidence has waned amid a regulatory probe of off - balance - sheet transactions . dynegy has agreed to acquire enron in a stock swap worth some $ 9 billion , a fraction of what enron was worth a year ago . shares of enron were up 43 cents , or 4 . 65 percent , at $ 9 . 67 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . us spot coal : prices drift lower on slack demand , enron 11 / 13 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones averages not volume weighted 4 q ' 01 lq ' 02 cal 2002 central appalachia low sulfur f . o . b . barge $ 30 . 00 -

" this will be an asset - backed trading business coupled with ( enron ' s ) market - making capabilities , " he told reuters in an interview on tuesday . " our approach has been different ( to enron ' s ) , " he added . " they have believed in pure trading . we have believed in a very disciplined approach to assets , " he added . dynegy has agreed to buy its bigger rival enron in a $ 9 billion rescue deal . the deal , announced last week , came after enron suffered a share - price collapse and damaging credit downgrades triggered by a regulatory probe into off - balance sheet dealings . cardone said he considered spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium as attractive hunting grounds for assets , though he said dynegy would remain a cautious buyer . some new entrants to europe ' s liberalising energy markets had overpaid for assets in recent deals , he said . cardone declined to comment on speculation that dynegy was a bidder for two power stations in britain , bought last month for $ 960 million by u . s . group american electric power co . . earlier this year dynegy agreed to buy the gas storage business of britain ' s bg group for 421 million pounds ( $ 608 million ) . no rush to sell enron assets cardone said dynegy would not rush to dispose of enron assets in europe , which include some power generation . " our back is not up against the wall to do a fire sale . we will look at each ( enron ) asset individually , " he said . enron has interests in around 4 , 500 megawatts of electricity generating capacity in italy , spain , poland , turkey and the uk . on a trading level , cardone said the takeover of enron would lead to consolidation but he declined give details . both companies have set up offices across europe in recent years as market liberalisation has triggered an increase in energy trading . including bg ' s storage operation , dynegy has a european staff of about 400 . enron , which has piled into european energy trading in recent years and has been a major driver of liquidity , has a european staff of around 5 , 000 . the company is among the top gas and power traders in the uk and germany . cardone said dynegy would operate with only one online trading platform . enron does much of its trading via its enrononline internet platform while dynegy is trying to build liquidity on its own dynegydirect system . " our initial thoughts are that enrononline is an outstanding platform , " said cardone , adding dynegy might consider selling or renting out its dynegydirect . " we will only work with one portal , " he said . " enrononline was a great concept , although we are not convinced that we are so far behind it with dynegydirect .

' ' frances laserson , moody ' s vice president of corporate communications , declined to comment . ` ` our discussions with clients are highly confidential , ' ' she said . critical role moody ' s played a critical role in part because enron was already having trouble raising money . the company had had its rating lowered in october and a slowdown in the economy had prompted some banks to restrict credit . a downgrade to junk by moody ' s , which rates more than $ 85 trillion in securities , would have created a cash crisis by forcing enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds and limiting its ability to sell short - term debt . a junk rating would have prompted dynegy to abandon the acquisition , said watson , and cost lehman , j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . a collective $ 105 million in fees for advising the two companies . in seeking to salvage the rating , the executives argued a downgrade to junk would lead enron to file for bankruptcy protection . they said moody ' s would shoulder the blame , according to people involved in the conversations . on thursday morning , moody ' s was willing to take that risk . executives at the ratings company , led by chief administration officer debra perry , told watson and his bankers at lehman that it was about to issue a press release cutting enron to junk . moody ' s officials said enron couldn ' t keep an investment grade rating because the company had no access to the commercial paper market . a probe by the securities and exchange commission into its accounting practices and a 90 percent plunge in its shares had eroded investor confidence . calling on friends with little time to respond , watson and senior wall street bankers swung into action . watson called his friend david o ' reilly , chief executive officer of chevrontexaco inc . , dynegy ' s largest shareholder . o ' reilly didn ' t have time at such short notice to push enron ' s case , watson said . next he enlisted john watson , chevrontexaco ' s chief financial officer , and darald callahan , a member of the boards of dynegy and chevrontexaco , to call moody ' s . lehman ' s ceo fuld and chief fixed - income analyst ted izatt also pitched in , as did j . p . morgan ceo harrison and michael carpenter , who runs salomon , a citigroup inc . unit . izatt , the no . 1 ranked analyst for investment grade energy companies according to institutional investor magazine , previously worked as a managing director at moody ' s . j . p . morgan chase and salomon were advising enron . officials at lehman , j . p . morgan chase and salomon declined to comment through spokespeople . fees watson said he and other bankers argued a combined dynegy and enron would be a much stronger company given a $ 1 . 5 billion cash injection from chevrontexaco , which owns 26 percent of dynegy . ` ` to be honest , i didn ' t understand why moody ' s was having difficulties making this happen , ' ' watson said . later that day , moody ' s executives told dynegy they were prepared to keep enron at investment grade as long as six changes were made to the proposed acquisition , according to watson . most of the changes focused around the ` ` material adverse change ' ' clause , which allowed dynegy to cancel the deal under certain conditions . one of those changes would have required dynegy to eliminate a clause that allowed the company to walk away if enron ' s debt ratings were cut to junk . watson said he agreed to the changes . ` ` if things got bad enough at enron that it had to be taken to junk , there would probably be a material change in its business that would allow us to walk away , ' ' he said . chevrontexaco watson and kenneth lay , enron ' s ceo , signed off on the revised terms on thursday . chevrontexaco , however , had yet to agree . o ' reilly first heard of the changes from lehman bankers at a dinner on thursday night celebrating chevron corp . ' s $ 45 . 8 billion acquisition of texaco inc . , that was being held at the victor stewart steakhouse in walnut creek , san francisco , according to people at the dinner . lehman ' s bankers , including steve wolitzer , co - head of mergers and acquisitions , and two colleagues , carlos fierro and grant porter , flew to san francisco that day to participate because they had advised chevron on the deal . during the flight they received emails on their blackberry pagers from colleagues in houston detailing the concessions that moody ' s had sought . tuna steaks after discussing the new terms with o ' reilly over tuna steaks and filet mignon , the group agreed to reconvene at chevron ' s offices in san ramon , california at 6 : 45 a . m . local time friday morning . while the officials were deliberating , moody ' s cut its rating on enron to ` ` baa 3 , ' ' one level above junk . john diaz , a managing director who follows the company for moody ' s , said at the time that enron now needs to ` ` shore up confidence in the company so that counter - parties continue to trade with it . ' ' moody ' s maintained its negative outlook . chevron still needed more time to consider the terms . at 5 : 50 p . m . new york time o ' reilly called dynegy ' s watson to tell him chevron ' s board had agreed . about 15 minutes later , enron and dynegy announced the purchase . ` ` it ' s amazing how this deal came together , ' ' watson said . enron corp . raised to ` maintain position ' at edward jones 2001 - 11 - 13 10 : 44 ( new york ) princeton , new jersey , nov . 13 ( bloomberg data ) - - enron corp . ( ene us ) was raised to ` ` maintain position ' ' from ` ` reduce ' ' by analyst brian youngberg at edward jones . lemon laws won ' t save dynegy by peter eavis > senior columnist realmoney . com 11 / 13 / 2001 07 : 21 am est if you believe dynegy ' s ( dyn : nyse - news - commentary ) account of its planned purchase of energy - trading rival enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) , it ' s getting a slightly damaged mercedes for the price of a pinto . at face value , it appears to be a fabulous deal . dynegy is acquiring a weakened - but - repairable competitor on the cheap . so what ' s not to like ? the problem is , dynegy seems to be taking a rather sunny view of enron ' s future . recent earnings restatements and other revelations suggest enron may actually be a junker when it comes to profitability , though enron ' s disclosure practices make it impossible to know for sure . then there are indications that dynegy doesn ' t expect to write down the value of enron assets by large amounts , which , if true , will certainly raise eyebrows , given the poor performance of many enron businesses . if dynegy proves to have been optimistic in its merger math , investors may start betting against this deal . such an outcome would increase suspicions that dynegy rushed into this merger because an enron collapse would ' ve cratered its business . echoing statements from dynegy executives on a monday conference call , company spokesman steve stengel denied his company is doing the merger because it feared being damaged by an enron collapse . dynegy actually owes enron money , rather than the other way ' round , he said . " enron ' s core business is strong , and that was a key reason dynegy undertook merger discussions with enron , " stengel remarks . both stocks rose sharply monday , enron adding 61 cents to $ 9 . 24 and dynegy rising $ 5 . 55 , or 14 % , to $ 44 . 31 . still , enron remains 22 % below dynegy ' s implied acquisition price . the stock action suggests the market is deeply divided over the deal . the deep discount on enron is a sign that the deal won ' t get done . yet dynegy ' s leap implies solid investor backing for the transaction and its economics . until we know more about enron ' s numbers , we won ' t be able to judge whether dynegy investors are right to be bullish , however . strong indeed among the deal ' s avid supporters were a number of sell - side analysts who are longtime enron bulls . they particularly liked dynegy ' s prediction that the combined entity , to be called dynegy , would post earnings 35 % above current 2002 estimates for stand - alone dynegy . and these bulls point out that this accretion number doesn ' t include any merger synergies and it assumes enron ' s 2002 earnings are $ 1 . 50 , which is 25 % lower than analysts currently expect . dynegy executives repeatedly stated monday that they wanted to get rid of enron ' s noncore operations and keep the trading business , which has contributed the lion ' s share of enron earnings , as well as pipeline assets . clearly , dynegy believes that enron ' s core trading business made real profits . how much of a leap of faith is that ? a considerable one . as this column has noted , enron doesn ' t make it possible to break out profit margins for trading , which is included in the wholesale line in enron ' s income statements . in fact , the wholesale line includes substantial asset gains , many of which are probably one - time in nature . enron ' s deals with obscure partnerships gave a huge boost to profits , according to earnings restatements made last week . don ' t forget that it ' s these partnership dealings that are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . without them , and excluding one - time sales , enron ' s traders may actually make very little . marky mark one fear was that dynegy would have to mark down enron ' s underperforming assets by billions of dollars . charges erode equity . lower equity would possibly mean a higher debt - to - capital ratio ( calculated by taking debt as a percentage of total capital , or debt plus equity ) . if this ratio gets above 50 % to 55 % , rating agencies might consider downgrading dynegy , which could deter counterparties from trading with it . but dynegy expects the debt - to - capital ratio to be about 40 % in the merged institution . somewhat implausibly , dynegy ' s forecasts don ' t appear to factor in big markdowns in enron equity . in the third quarter of next year , enron ' s equity is expected to be $ 9 . 5 billion . that ' s only slightly below what it probably was at the end of this year ' s third quarter ( enron still hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet ) . how can it not decrease over the next 12 months ? a person familiar with the matter says that dynegy also expects to mark up enron assets at the time of the deal ' s closing . these markups are expected to at least partially offset any markdowns , this person adds . but it ' s tough to identify any enron assets that could qualify for hefty positive adjustments , while it ' s easier to point out assets that deserve negative ones . dynegy needs to break out markups and markdowns and reveal which assets are being subject to the adjustments . dynegy ' s stengel didn ' t comment on the question of equity writedowns . by stretching too far in its assumptions , dynegy may be trying to dress up a risky merger as a safe one . but a risky merger may , in dynegy ' s view , have been preferable to having enron go down . again and again monday , dynegy execs said they ' ve done their due diligence and they believe that there aren ' t any huge skeletons in enron ' s closet that could upset the merger . but contrast this stance with that of standard & poor ' s analysts , who said friday that they would ' ve downgraded enron ' s debt to junk status if dynegy hadn ' t agreed to buy enron . one of the s & p analysts said friday that they didn ' t have a full understanding of all the partnerships that enron has been dealing with . if s & p , which , like other rating agencies , has been locked in deep and detailed discussions with enron for weeks , doesn ' t know the effect of all the partnerships , how can dynegy ? " dynegy has been doing business with enron for 16 years . we know them and they know us , " stengel replies . " we are comfortable with the due diligence we have conducted thus far and will continue to look at enron and their operations in the coming weeks and months . " until dynegy comes up with more details , assume enron is a pinto . dynegy asked ferc to revise regs cbsmarketwatch . com , 11 / 13 / 01 lisa sanders houston ( cbs . mw ) - - long before enron and its northern natural gas pipeline entered the picture , dynegy complained to the federal energy regulatory commission about companies with pipeline systems crowding out competitors from the natural gas transmission market . in a filing dated jan . 5 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) asked to speak in front of the ferc about what it characterized as " affiliate abuse and structural preferences , " which are " alive and growing in the gas industry . " now , even if dynegy ' s $ 9 billion takeover of enron fails , the power generator can keep the energy trader ' s northern natural gas pipeline , according to the merger agreement . " they ' re kind of complaining about themselves now , " said raymond plank , chairman and chief executive of natural gas and oil producer houston - based apache corp . ( apa ) , in an interview . northern natural is enron ' s ( ene ) largest transmission system with 17 , 000 miles of pipeline . " our position has not changed , " dynegy spokesman steve stengel said in an e - mail to cbs . marketwatch . com . " we do not believe that companies should be able to ' abuse ' their power within a market and we also believe that regulators need to continue to monitor markets to ensure market abuse does not occur . " in a subsequent e - mail , stengel said " we are going to comply fully with ferc regulations . " the answer was in response to a question about how dynegy plans to guard against abuse once it owns a pipeline system . in the executive summary dynegy filed to the ferc , the company claimed that structural affiliate preference " is a far greater threat to market participants in coming years . " dynegy contended that a pipeline or transmission company affiliate " can always pay more , or withstand greater risk from , services purchased from home pipelines because of the benefits inuring to the parent holding company . " dynegy also alleged that because affiliates control the pipelines , they crowd out competitors . one concern dynegy listed is the " vertical overlapping " of gas pipeline companies and utilities . dynegy owns the electric and gas utility illinois power . in its comments , dynegy advocated structural changes to the affiliate relationship in order to prevent abuse of the system and eliminate the preference problem . dynegy also recommended that if " rampant " abuse is found , the company should be required to divest the non - regulated affiliate . " on sept . 26 , the ferc issued a statement proposing a set of uniformly applied regulations to oversee the relationship between regulated transmission providers and their energy affiliates . citing the sweeping changes in both the gas and electricity markets , the ferc said that current rules " fail to address the sharing of confidential shipper information and transportation information with all energy affiliates . " the ferc proposed that the employees of transmission providers involved in the operation of transmission systems function apart from the providers ' sales or marketing employees and energy affiliates . " in addition , the prohibition on preferential sharing of transmission information would be broadened to include all energy affiliates , " the ferc stated . apache ' s plank said his company is in the process of figuring out how best to help . apache wants to take the volatility out of the energy market , and he pegs dynegy and enron as major contributors to the situation . " the government says they believe in transparency , but they believe it applies to everyone ( else ) , " he said . " if they let us know what they ' re looking for , we could be very helpful in the interest of the u . s .

2	Subject: capital book to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge . the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below . the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged . capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity . on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost . by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization . questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to : joe deffner 853 - 7117 alan quaintance 345 - 7731 
2	Subject: important info about your 401 k plan dear enron employee , i am a retirement plan specialist with raymond james & associates ( rjf - nyse ) . i understand these are trying times at your company and i hope that your are not too heavily affected by the current distressed financial situation of your company . i once was employed by a company that filed bankruptcy so i speak from experience and have previously been placed in your precarious position . being a retirement plan specialist , and having worked with associates that have enron clients , i want to share some important information about your retirement plan benefits . should you have any questions about retirement plans your queries are more than welcome . i want to make you aware that you are allowed to rollover into an individual ira any portion of your retirement benefit plan which you have contributed to as an in service distribution provided you have met enron ' s vesting requirement , which is either 2 or 5 years of participation . i would strongly recommend that it is probably a good idea to think about doing so with th exception of your enron stock . there are other factors to consider however like the possibilty of forfeiting loan provisions should enron pull through among others . keep in mind however , that although your current asset holdings are protected by erisa , should the company file bankruptcy those assets remaining in the company sponsored plan can be frozen for an unspecified amount of time , denying you access to your funds . an ira rollover gives you more flexibility and choices of investments and seperates the assets from company control . if you have questions or need assistance in rolling over your plan assets please call me at 1 - 800 - 523 - 3295 from 8 - 5 est or email me at jsarlat @ 33 e . rjf . com . my personal and corporate website can be found at www . raymondjames . com / johnsarlat should you require more information about my personal or companies qualifications . please inform your co - workers about their rights and options under the plan . obviously time is of the essence ! i wish you the best of luck and hope that the challenging environment changes for the better . i have included an article at the bottom of this page . . sincerely , john sarlat > john c . sarlat financial advisor , investments raymond james spread your risks by diversifying your holdings . traditional " defined benefit " retirement plans are subject to a 10 percent limit on investments in employer stock , but there is no such limit for " defined contribution " plans like the 401 ( k ) . u . s . senator barbara boxer tried a few years ago to have the same limit apply to 401 ( k ) plans , but the measure ran into vigorous opposition from employers who wanted to retain the right to make their matching contributions in their own stock . as the rules stand companies are allowed to make all of their matching contributions in their own stock and workers may also put all of their own money into company stock too . diversification is thwarted in many cases by regulations that prevent employees from selling company stock before they reach a certain age - - 50 in enron ' s case . james delaplane of the american benefits council , an employer group , said the 401 ( k ) system places great responsibility for retirement savings on individual workers . " there are people who think that ' s the greatest thing since sliced bread and there are people who think that ' s the worst thing , " he said . delaplane said his organization wants to preserve employers ' right to contribute company stock to employee retirement plans but also supports efforts to educate workers so that they can make better informed investment decisions . david certner , a pensions specialist with the american association of retired persons ( aarp ) , said there is plenty of work to be done in that area . " many employees aren ' t aware of basic rules of investing , nor of the meaning of diversification . some actually view employer stock as a less risky investment than a mutual fund , " he said .

2	Subject: california 3 / 23 executive summary : bottom line - qfs better off today , utilities in worse shape after passing senate , the qf bill fails on technical grounds in assembly cal energy ruling provides possible escape for qfs from utility commitments california net short gas supply for the summer worsens if qfs break contracts hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper , further litigation expected 1 . qf bill fails in surprise twist ab 8 x ( the qf bill ) failed in the assembly ( 48 - 24 ) . the republicans were opposed because three measures , the sdg & e fix , the ab lx fix , and the qf fix were all rolled into one bill by the senate . they want the three measures split up . concern was raised by san diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in sb 43 x . as noted yesterday , the qfs will now await a cpuc ruling on tuesday . 2 . cal energy ruling sets stage for " dozens " of similar q . f . suits the cpuc ruling is now less important because of the cal energy ruling yesterday , which gave the qfs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities . cal energy reportedly would have filed an involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow ( friday ) had they not won their law suit . dozens , if not hundreds of suits identical to that filed by calenergy can now be expected from the other qfs . the qfs reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct into the merchant market , possibly out - of - state . they also want to avoid any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a stage 2 or stage 3 alert , and will contest any such measure with the ferc . 3 . summer outlook worsens the outlook for the summer now appears much grimmer for the state . if the gas - fired qfs alone manage to extricate themselves from their contracts with the utilities , the state will be a net 10 , 000 mw short for the summer rather than 5 , 000 mw . this is a much larger net short position to fill , and will be much harder for state treasurer angelides to sell to wall street . if all of the qfs break their contracts , the state will be 14 , 000 to 15 , 000 mw short . essentially , if the qfs are successful in court ( as it appears they would be ) , they are no longer part of the pool of low , fixed - rate power that the state can count on . the onus now appears to be on treasurer angelides to come up with a rate schedule . the qfs may go to him and ask for the state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts ( the state would , of course , charge for this privilege ) and negotiate a more flexible rate structure . 4 pressure mounts on utilities none of this helps the utilities ' situation . in fact , now that the qfs have a way out of their contracts through the courts , it appears that the business base of the utilities is reduced , so they are actually in a worse situation . reportedly some of the utilities ' commercial paper now has been sold to hedge funds . as one source put it , " the vultures have moved in . " these are " the types of people who litigate . "

2	Subject: erd review here ' s a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with . general status of the database model : fix not represented - need to incorporate into common design and standardize - might cause some fix rework . referential integrity not entirely enforced - potential for bad data to develop . snapshots from global databases are currently daily - this can be easily changed to be more frequent , but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of global as a part of commodity logic is made . rate information not developed - need integration with rate server or mkm , preferably mkm . need to define how mkm will be used - whether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well . application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database . therefore , some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard . this needs to happen relatively quickly . specific issues : gfd _ pipe _ meters _ snp - probably need to add fac _ type ( wh , ite , etc ) for possible use as validation in kx functionality gas _ deal _ location _ dtl - this table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter . facility number is an enronism that no other company will recognize . pipe and meter general - should try to avoid using pipe _ cd as key . this value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold . - data for facilities is heavily dependent upon enron global facilities database in current design and functionality - this needs revisiting as the decision surrounding global is made cp _ addr _ vw - this table references only internal _ cp _ id and contact _ type _ cd in conjunction with address _ id . addresses are specific to internal _ cp _ id , product _ cd , deal _ nature _ cd , contact _ type _ cd , and region _ cd . need to add deal nature , product , and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary counterparty - there is a mixture of the usage of global counterparty . some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from enron ' s global counterparty system , by having a table to capture commodity logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers , credit ratings , etc . this would position cl to become independent at a later date . yet , commodity logic functions as a subset of enron networks and gcp must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by enron networks to obtain an sap id and support payment processing through to sap . so , cl could not become independent without further functionality or process changes . so why not put the added data requirements within gcp to start with ? if global moves to commodity logic , then this design needs to be revisited for sure . there should probably be some standardization between dependence / independence whether or not cl separates from enron . common data - status is not included in the views being utilized by the applications . i hope the views have been filtered for active status only . show was going to check on this . - concept of mapping others ' codes to ours for processing , is not supported anywhere in these tables . perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the fix design ? this will have to be there for internal release as well as external release . this is critical to the hub concept . i look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues . let me know if you have further questions .

" lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations , and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating . analysts have raised the possibility that , should enron ' s credit rating and stock price continue to fall , the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with . ng / cml for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . us class action suit filed against enron for misleading statements 10 / 23 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd new york ( afx ) - milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach llp law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against enron corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between jan 18 , 2000 and oct 17 , 2001 , thereby inflating the company ' s share price artificially . the suit was filed on behalf of enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the us district court in houston against enron corp , enron ceo kenneth lay , former enron ceo jeffrey skilling , who resigned recently , and enron chief financial officer andrew fastow . the suit claims that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy . the company ' s operating results were also " materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write - down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships " managed by the company ' s cfo . the suit additionally alleges that enron was failing to write - down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap . on oct 16 , enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non - recurring charges of 1 . 01 bln after - tax , or 1 . 11 usd per share , which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron ' s chief financial officer . enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1 . 2 bln usd . enron ' s share price consequently fell sharply . during the class period , enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally - held enron common stock . holders of enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than dec 21 , milberg weiss said . yesterday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions . jkm / shw for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial post : news word of sec probe puts enron into deep dive : problems mount david howard sinkman reuters 10 / 23 / 2001 national post national fp 2 ( c ) national post 2001 . all rights reserved . new york - shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 % yesterday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august . a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating . the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry . investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took us $ 1 . 01 - billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments . problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after six months at the helm . enron shares declined us $ 5 . 49 , or 21 % , to us $ 20 . 56 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange yesterday , shaving off almost us $ 4 . 2 - billion of its market capitalization . the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 % yesterday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 . enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into " certain related - party transactions " involved the partnerships .

" questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses . the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading . according to the annual report the " related party transactions " , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively . mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were . they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp . " we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , " added mr lay . the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions . enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating . an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion . the sec inquiry is " informal " , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment . enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 10 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on " certain related - party transactions " that had been previously disclosed to the sec . " we welcome this request , " said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive . " we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , " he said . the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water . investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn . in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning . skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure . on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments . but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the " early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . " in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions . but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion . the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported . lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed . a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court . many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say . investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses . and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released . analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a " hold " from a " buy " rating monday out of such frustration . coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron . but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong . " i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , " he said . investors are panicking because of a " bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , " said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

2	Subject: re : continuing testing of preschedule workspace , path confirmation and path cut software cara , first of all , thanks for your input . regarding the new issues with path confirmation , most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily . vish is already working on them . concerning the colors , there are three sets of colors representing market , supply and transmission . i have asked vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking . this information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application . regarding pre - schedule , adding print capability to the error log should be no problem . also , adding " check for errors " functionality will be done . concerning " capability not supported : deal has multiple delivery points " ; i believe this is raised when there are multiple strips ( either term or schedule ) for a deal , but the strips have different delivery points . the routing process is not able to determine which strips to use . i will confirm this . we have already changed path confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name . i may have both the code and description displayed . i believe corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records ( corry , can you confirm this ? ) . the information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days , but if you have more , please send it . thanks , will - - - - - original message - - - - - from : semperger , cara sent : friday , july 13 , 2001 4 : 21 pm to : atta , asem ; smith , will cc : bentley , corry ; poston , david ; williams iii , bill subject : continuing testing of preschedule workspace , path confirmation and path cut software i am working in the target date of june 20 th . today i added schedules from palo verde and the entire midc sheet to the testing group . once cob is added , we will have pretty much an average daily volume . here is my attached worksheet for mid c > in preschedule workspace : i added palo verde to the group of deals imported , and ran a total of 37 lines into the path confirmation . the rest of the sheet was all bookouts , and so i marked them for routing only . i do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation . this will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for real time and settlements . i would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up , as the lists can be long , and i have to make notes on what is wrong . also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time . we currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths . this would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet , instead of cleaning up afterwards . routing functionality question : if we change a delivery point in scheduling ( bpa nw delivered gets moved and changed every day ) , do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point ? these types of deals route now , i would like to duplicate that existing functionality . i did get an error message on those lines , " capability not supported : deal has multiple delivery points " please see the attached sheet , there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86 , but it is all deals that are our bpa northwest delivered . the routing speed is excellent . one second per line or less all the way in portland on local enpower ! the megawatts also appear to split properly between mis - matched deal amounts ! this is very encouraging . my palo data was corrupted , so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points . my plan is to attack the alias stuff from a different angle . we are going to work with the team that sets the enpower " short name " to something that is workable . i would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that enpower short name . in path confirmation the early sorting looks good , things look very versatile and useable . yesterday i identified several problems : 1 . the entire path needs to be shown in both counterparty paths . currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp . 2 . the alias list is not functioning properly . the enpower long name needs to be shown in the collapsed counterparty view , along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp . 3 . confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch , not pulling up each deal line by line . today , i am finding the following : 1 . when a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view , the system blows away the schedule term and the delivery point . these fields have to be re - populated before saving can occur . 2 . i am not allowed to sort by global id , even though global ids are populated there . my idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section , no globals go in another section , and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers . ( just like the phys vs . non phys ) . 3 . pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes . this is to long to be practical in production for real time . i would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less . 4 . all paths are showing up as being cut ( cut checkbox checked ) , even though none have been cut yet . 5 . the grey on grey color scheme is not going to work , but that is a little thing . lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable . variations of the beige color are easier to read . 6 . the path cut button and dialog boxes i think are going to need alot of work . it looks like i will have to do all the enpower work first , and then populate the cut . this is a bit different than we discussed . my plan is to take this as far as i can , and then hand it over to bill williams iii and his group for final ' tweaking ' . 7 . i also cannot sort by tag number . we need that . thank you all for your work on this , it is really looking good . i have to schedule on monday , but will jump right back in when i am finished with daily tasks . cara

2	Subject: fw : getting a deal done - - - - - original message - - - - - from : belden , tim sent : thursday , december 20 , 2001 3 : 27 pm to : lavorato , john ; whalley , greg subject : getting a deal done i recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now . however , i feel that i currently don ' t possess the information that i would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in newco . i will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what i have heard about structures so far . excuse me if i am off on any ( or all ) of my facts . i am currently receiving mostly second - hand information from gas and power traders in houston . here is the citibank deal as i understand it : requirement to retain between 5 and 15 employees to do the deal . fund ( at some unknown level ) a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the 800 newco people . 800 employees $ 30 million of 1 - day 95 % var total 2002 costs of approximately $ 300 million . bonus pool equals 20 % of ebit bonus paid out 75 % in cash and 25 % in restricted stock with a 3 - year cliff vest . here are my concerns the cost structure appears to be well above what a $ 30 million var trading operation can support . my recollection from west power rovar is roughly 90 % in 1998 , 120 % in 1999 , and close to 200 % in 2000 and 2001 . i ' m not sure how to handicap expected future rovar , but without additional information from the two of you i have a hard time expecting more than 100 % in a lower - priced commodity market . given that assumption , the $ 30 million one - day var becomes $ 480 million annualized var gives you gross margin of $ 480 million . i don ' t know what the capital and credit charges will be , for arguments sake let ' s call it $ 30 million . bonus pool equals $ 480 - $ 30 - $ 300  $ 150 * 20 %  $ 30 million of which $ 22 . 5 is cash and $ 7 . 5 equity . i can ' t sign up for that math . please help me understand how / why my math is wrong . i need to understand our cost structure in great detail . we need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level . if i look at west power ( everyone in portland ) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $ 200 , 000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $ 16 million . add on another $ 4 million for rent , parking , travel and entertainment . . . and call it $ 20 million of direct expenses here . i figure that we can make $ 100 million in 2002 with lower var and starting up later in the year . how much of the $ 280 million remaining costs should i expect to be allocated to the west power desk . with an ebit of $ 80 million times 20 % i can sell . if we have another $ 50 million of allocated costs then i can sell this . i recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk ebit . however , i think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk ebit and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that . proposed retention structure for three people in portland a dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years . price tag tbd . create certainty around the bonus / retention payments . indemnify against payback of deferred comp . clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk . 15 % of gross margin for 2002 . 20 % of ebit going forward . other gripes labor has not been invited to the negotiating table . labor doesn ' t get to see the pro forma . we are supposed to get paid based on ebit yet i have no control over the expense side or the allocation side . labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating . labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn ' t appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure . i want to make this thing work . i am not trying to be greedy . i am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that i have been given . tim

2	Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak erin , a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers . the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page . the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested . we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall . the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business . the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired power plants ) . the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier . discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely , optimistic , pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions . the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk . this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project . the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to stress - test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions . if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions . i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices , but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend . one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand . enron north america corp . from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : pre - submitted question on espeak good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens . thanks . - er submitted by breineck i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles for a more in - depth study of this area ? is quantification of risk or uncertainty the major challenge in using this concept ? can statistical tools be used with this to do a sort of sensitivity analysis ? 
2	Subject: ferc limits access to pipeline maps note : fyi , we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term . ferc limits public access to pipe , transmission maps amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities , the federal energy regulatory commission is limiting the public ' s access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines . in a statement of policy , the commission said it would " no longer make available to the public " maps of these energy facilities through the internet , the records and information management system ( rims ) and the public reference room at its headquarters in washington , dc . persons wishing to view the maps , however , can make requests under the freedom of information act ( foia ) at the commission . ferc staff has been urged to " respond timely to legitimate requests " for such documents . the commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days . the move by ferc was not as drastic as some federal agencies , such as the nuclear regulatory commission , which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution . given the anthrax scares on capitol hill and elsewhere , a spokeswoman said the commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages .

2	Subject: trading support operations - london rick , not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function , particularly as it relates to our global products business , we already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area . the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution . well - nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry understands this as well as anybody . if we had a more suitable candidate , we would give him / her the job . i have seen barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the team that we have built around him . i ' m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the global products support functions ' in to the fold ' . however , he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and , whilst i do not share ted ' s views , i do not hold barry out as a saint and i can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded . i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted within houston , who can instill confidence there . steve young ( head of rac in london ) may be an interesting option , although i ' m sure he would not be easy to replace . in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will be monitoring the situation very closely . regards fernley .

' s finances , moody ' s investors service inc . lowered its ratings by one notch on the energy company ' s senior unsecured debt and kept the company under review for a possible further downgrade . it also was learned that the securities and exchange commission has moved its inquiry into enron ' s finances to the agency ' s washington headquarters from its regional office in fort worth , texas . the change is a sign that the probe is being treated as a high priority , according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry . an sec spokesman declined to comment . moody ' s reduction on enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt to baa 2 from baal leaves the company ' s credit rating two levels above noninvestment grade . if the energy - trading giant ' s ratings were to fall to a noninvestment - grade level , there could be serious consequences for enron . it could throw the houston company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings and force it under the terms of various financial agreements to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt , which would dilute the value of existing shares . while enron still has some room before hitting noninvestment - grade status , there have been concerns among analysts and investors that the company ' s recent troubles could escalate . during recent days enron ' s bonds have traded at levels similar to securities that carry a noninvestment - grade rating . prices of the company ' s bonds improved somewhat yesterday , though its stock price continued to fall sharply . in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading , enron stock was at $ 13 . 81 , down $ 1 . 59 or 10 % , and topped the most - active list with 36 . 4 million shares changing hands . enron ' s share price has fallen more than 50 % during the past two weeks . an enron spokeswoman said the company is " working diligently " to keep an investment - grade credit rating . among other things , the nation ' s biggest energy - trading firm is in negotiations with its banks on a new $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion credit line to bolster its liquidity . enron repeatedly has said its business operations remain strong . yesterday ' s ratings downgrade is the latest piece of bad news for a company that has been engulfed in turmoil during the past two weeks . confidence in its financial situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to transactions it had carried out with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow . last week , enron named a successor to mr . fastow and said the sec was looking into the deals . the sec is looking into whether enron violated federal - securities laws regarding its handling and disclosure of the transactions connected to mr . fastow , the person familiar with the probe said . generally , the sec ' s headquarters office has more resources to apply to complex , high - profile cases than regional offices do . moving the enron inquiry to headquarters indicates that the sec is looking to make a decision relatively quickly about whether or not to allege securities - law violations by the company , this person said . enron repeatedly has said the transactions were proper and legal . yesterday , the enron spokeswoman said the company is continuing to cooperate with the sec probe and is gathering and sending the agency information that it requested . moody ' s said the downgrade was " prompted by the deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility , " which has contributed to " a substantial loss in investor confidence . " going forward , moody ' s said it will focus on enron management ' s " success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability " from major trading partners . enron is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades in the nation . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron credit rating is cut , and its share price suffers by bloomberg news 10 / 30 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company shares of the enron corporation fell sharply yesterday after moody ' s investors service lowered the company ' s credit rating , igniting concern that it might have more difficulty raising the cash it needs to finance day - to - day operations . moody ' s lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings to baa 2 , two levels above so - called junk status , from baal . moody ' s also said it might downgrade enron ' s commercial paper rating , which could make it harder for the company , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , to borrow the short - term cash it needs to run its trading business in the future . the company borrowed from banks to repay $ 2 billion in commercial paper last week . it is trying to raise $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks . ' ' a credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their borrowing power , ' ' said joe correnti , who follows enron for wayne hummer investments in chicago . ' ' that ' s not a good place for them to be . they have somewhat aggressive expansion plans . ' ' shares of enron , which is based in houston , plunged $ 1 . 59 , or 10 . 3 percent , to $ 13 . 81 , continuing the daily trading losses dating to oct . 17 , when enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of trading commodities like electricity and natural gas . the company ' s stock , which is down almost 60 percent in a week , is falling faster than the company ' s debt because the bond holders have first claim on assets after bank loans are paid . after the moody ' s downgrade , the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents , to 80 cents on each $ 1 of face value . yields have risen to 12 . 1 percent , up from 10 . 8 percent before that downgrade , traders said . the bonds were trading at face value the week before . moody ' s said the cut was prompted by the ' ' deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility ' ' since the write - downs and charges . investment partnerships involving the company ' s former chief financial officer that had not been disclosed before this month ' ' led to a substantial loss in investor confidence , ' ' moody ' s said . andrew fastow , the former chief financial officer , resigned , and the securities and exchange commission asked for information about the transactions he conducted for the partnerships he headed . enron ' s recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit - rating reduction . ' ' this move was anticipated , ' ' said mike dineen , who holds enron bonds in the $ 5 billion of fixed - income assets he helps manage at the mony life insurance company . enron ' s long - term credit ratings outlook was changed last week to negative from stable by standard & poor ' s . s . & p . affirmed the company ' s rating of bbb + , the equivalent of moody ' s baal . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . front page - companies oct 30 , 2001 by sheila mcnulty and jenny wiggins moody ' s investors service yesterday downgraded the long - term debt ratings of enron , the us energy group , citing " the deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility " over the past two weeks . moody ' s was the first of the main rating agencies to downgrade the struggling houston - based company ' s debt by lowering it from three to just two notches above " junk " status . moody ' s began reviewing enron for a possible downgrade on october 16 , when the company disclosed a surprising dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholder equity tied to controversial financing vehicles set up by andrew fastow , then chief financial officer . mr fastow was replaced last week , as enron ' s share and bond prices plunged on concerns about other possible disclosures . the securities and exchange commission is undertaking an informal inquiry into the group ' s financial dealings . enron has been forced to seek additional credit from banks after raising dollars 3 . 3 bn in cash last week to boost its financial position . investors have grown increasingly wary about a company that has long been a wall street favourite . its stock has fallen by more than 50 per cent since october 16 , and its bond prices are trading at levels technically considered " junk " status . " moody ' s actions are prompted by the deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility since the company announced significant write - downs as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments , " moody ' s said . " this led to a substantial loss in investor confidence . " even as the us rating agency lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings from baal to baa 2 , it said they remained on review for downgrade . moody ' s also placed enron ' s prime 2 rating for commercial paper on review . yesterday enron ' s stock closed the day off dollars 1 . 59 - 10 . 32 per cent - at dollars 1 . 81 and its five - year bond was quoted at about 82 cents in the dollar . sell - or - buy poser , page 22 private equity woes , page 30 www . ft . com / enron copyright : the financial times limited global investing : private equity woes sap enron ' s energy financial times ; oct 30 , 2001 enron has just provided the world with another lesson in the difficulties of public companies investing in private equity . on october 16 the company ' s management announced a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge and a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction to shareholders ' equity arising from ljm 2 co - investment and ljm cayman , two structured products designed to protect it against the fluctuation in value of its private equity investments . andrew fastow , who was last week replaced as the chief financial officer of the houston - based energy trading giant , set up a private equity fund called ljm , designed to fund enron transactions . ljm deals did not normally appear on enron ' s balance sheet . and that may have been the point of the structure . a financial engineer explained that enron could have set up a fund , whose changing valuations did not increase the volatility of the trading company ' s earnings , by taking only a minority stake in the ljm fund with some passive co - investors . the investors would normally receive a debt - like pay - off , except in cases where the value of the private equity holdings fell , when they would get compensation in enron shares . the value of the portfolio , which included investments in the new power company and some broadband companies , did fall precipitously . by the end of last quarter enron was obliged to issue 62 m shares to the passive investors to compensate them . but instead it ended up taking large cash charges . was it worth all this trouble for enron to keep its volatile private equity holdings off its balance sheet ? obviously not . mr fastow has now taken a leave of absence and the securities and exchange commission has launched an informal investigation into whether enron ' s transactions with the ljm companies were really completed at arms ' length . the company ' s market capitalisation has halved and its bonds are trading at distressed levels . but there could still be a good argument for enron being in private equity . it is almost as much a technology company as it is an energy one and as such it might make sense to outsource some of its research and development to a corporate venture capital unit . the problem is shareholders ' dim view of private equity . shareholders refused to give chase manhattan bank a growth multiple when venture capital made up a large proportion of its earnings , but punished its successor , jp morgan chase , when it took a succession of private equity write - downs . jp morgan chase claims a 40 per cent internal rate of return on its investments since inception . but investors have remained stubbornly fixated on private equity ' s short - term valuation swings . the bank is now in the process of raising outside money for its private equity fund , jp morgan partners , in an effort to take some of its investment off the balance sheet and change the business into a steady revenue producer . private equity professionals argue that those swings are often meaningless anyway because half way through the life of many private equity investments , their valuations tend to look far worse than they end up . in enron ' s case it might have been easier for investors to keep their eyes on the long term , if the short - term outlook had been a little clearer . the trading company has faced severe criticism for its lack of disclosure to investors . ironically , the energy company ' s subtle balance sheet games may in the short term have increased the allure of the company ' s trading businesses , which continue to perform strongly and experience impressive growth . and for that reason it could probably be argued that mr fastow thought he was serving enron ' s interests by managing the partnerships - although he is also reported to have been very well compensated for the service . long - term the partnerships have clearly undermined enron ' s reputation for plain dealing still further . the saddest thing for the corporate world is that enron is arguably a more natural private equity investor than jp morgan . as a financial institution , jp morgan is arguably most interested in the short - term synergies private equity creates with its other businesses . high capital charges that bank private equity holdings will soon attract will make them less attractive as long - term investments . enron was investing in new businesses that it thought would help make its own businesses grow . it was harnessing the immense entrepreneurial power of private equity to make its business grow . the first reaction of investors and regulators will be to punish enron for its shenanigans . later someone might want to think about changing the mark to market system that drove it to these extraordinary lengths . copyright : the financial times limited companies & finance the americas - sell - or - buy poser facing energy analysts . by john labate and sheila mcnulty . 10 / 30 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved shares in enron , the energy trading company , continued their downward spiral yesterday , with investors responding coolly to reports that the houston company was seeking new credit lines . at midday the stock was down 9 per cent at $ 14 . 10 . investor anger has been focused on enron executives who still have much to explain about several off - balance - sheet vehicles and potential conflicts of interest for the company ' s former chief financial officer . wall street analysts are beginning to rethink their overwhelmingly favourable guidance earlier in the year . " if i could go back to july and downgrade the stock again , i would certainly do that , " said curt launer , analyst at credit suisse first boston . " i can ' t go back . the question is : what are you going to do today ? today , i would like to buy it because of the valuations . " mr launer continues to rate enron as a " strong buy " and he is not alone . despite weeks of turbulent financial disclosures , the august departure of enron ' s chief executive , jeff skilling , and the more recent departure of cfo andrew fastow , analysts have wavered little in their initial bullishness . among analysts who issue recommendations on the company , nine are " strong buys " , five are " buys " and only one is a " strong sell " , according to thomson financial / first call . there is no doubt the recent turmoil at enron has created a new difficulty for analysts . do they hold on and hope for an upturn despite continued questions about the company ' s disclosure quality , or do they recommend that investors unload their holdings for fears that problems could mount ? they are defending their recommendations based on enron ' s strong track record . net income , on an operating basis , surged 32 per cent last year to $ 1 . 3 bn , on revenues more than doubled to $ 101 bn . during the past 15 years , enron ' s market capitalisation surged from $ 2 bn to a peak of $ 70 bn . even today analysts point to enron ' s strong position in key sectors of power and gas trading . however , at least one independent research firm decided to tell investors to get out early . off wall street consulting group in cambridge , massachusetts , put enron on its " sell " list in early may when the shares traded just below $ 60 . " we discussed the partnerships ( former cfo ) fastow was involved in and that there was not much detail there , " said mark roberts , analyst at ows . " their accounting is extraordinarily difficult to get through and when people make things that difficult there ' s usually a reason . " despite their relative optimism , most analysts say more bad news could follow . " the clear immediate task for enron is to make sure it has enough liquidity to help maintain its credit rating , " said andre meade , head of us utility research at commerzbank securities . mr meade issued a " hold " recommendation early last year , but has since upgraded to " accumulate " as the stock became more affordable . " we ' ve been saying the numbers have been coming in and they have been hitting earnings ( estimates ) , but ( some of its ) businesses are black boxes and you don ' t know how the company is making money from quarter to quarter . " yesterday a new note of caution was sounded by carol levenson , fixed - income analyst at gimme credit research group . " the ensuing total collapse of management credibility and market confidence could have negative credit implications far beyond the potential financial impact disclosed so far , " she said .

" last thursday another leading rating agency , standard n 1 ( copyright 2001 by the chicago tribune ) bad things , it seems , often happen in threes . if that ' s so , wall street could be facing a bout of deja vu . three financial stories currently unfolding bear a slim resemblance to events that nearly caused gridlock in global financial markets in 1998 . the analogy is strained , but so are nerves in the post - sept . 11 era . case in point : the dow jones industrial average fell more than 275 points monday - - its biggest point loss since the week after markets reopened following the attacks - - despite a lack of dramatically downbeat news . one of the closely watched sagas on wall street , the deepening problems at energy trading innovator enron , is being compared to the tragically flawed long - term capital management private investment fund . at long - term capital , professional investors with impressive resumes made a series of disastrous bets , requiring a government - induced bailout in 1998 by major financial institutions that had financed their schemes with massive loans . on monday , houston - based enron struggled to raise emergency cash as its stock fell another 10 percent , to $ 13 . 81 . enron shares , which have fallen from above $ 80 at the end of last year , have collapsed more than 50 percent this month as analysts began to question mysterious financial deals between the company and company insiders . last week , enron ' s chief financial officer was replaced . there was no indication monday that enron ' s troubles have impaired the natural gas and electricity markets . nor has the enron predicament yet sparked a backdraft on its lenders . the two other strings of the story - - debt problems at a sovereign nation and currency imbalances - - seem relevant only by coincidence . the implosion at long - term capital occurred amid a surprise default by russia on international debts . separately , currencies of several asian countries ran aground a second year , events that deepened long - term capital ' s woes . current speculation that argentina will default on $ 132 billion of international debts hardly represents a shock similar to the russian debt default . the problems of argentina ' s economy and financial system , while serious , have been well - known for months . on monday , argentina hired a merrill lynch consultant , jacob frankel , to craft a financial restructuring and said a workout plan will be disclosed in a few days . meanwhile , monday ' s slide in the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets reversed the dollar ' s surprising strength in the wake of the attacks . indeed , the relative stability of the dollar has been a major contributor to investor confidence . the current slippage by the dollar hardly indicates extraordinary instability . as far as we know , enron was not engaged in currency speculation or deals pegged to argentina . but enron shareholders and the securities and exchange commission have just begun to investigate . monday ' s action : stocks closed broadly lower in light trading monday , as investors awaited several key economic reports due out this week , including friday ' s scheduled report on job losses and the unemployment rate in october . treasury securities rallied on expectations that the economic downturn will be more pronounced and longer than many investors believe and will prompt the federal reserve to cut interest rates through the end of the year . the dow jones industrial average fell 275 . 67 points , or 2 . 9 percent , to 9269 . 50 . chicago -

" we are in discussions about new credit lines , " enron spokeswoman karen denne said monday . " we ' re taking action to restore investor and market confidence . " ms . denne wouldn ' t disclose how much credit the company was seeking . the wall street journal reported in its monday editions that the amount is between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed . ms . denne said of the $ 3 billion in credit enron cashed in last week , $ 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt . currently , there are no plans for the other $ 1 billion , she said . moody ' s on monday lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings from baal to baa 2 where they remain on review for downgrade . moody ' s additionally placed the company ' s prime - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade , citing " substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses . " houston - based enron is the nation ' s biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . once a favorite of wall street , the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that , despite difficulties , its finances remain sound . confidence in enron ' s situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow . moody ' s said in a press release the " magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 % while slashing earnings . " enron ' s debt is still investment grade at both moody ' s and standard & poor ' s and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment - grade category . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . ceo : exelon monitoring enron problems , but no changes yet by jon kamp of dow jones newswires 10 / 29 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 312 - 750 - 4129 ; jon . kamp @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . late trading : enron continues to be pounded by investors by maxwell murphy of dow jones newswires 10 / 29 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones dow jones newswires ; 201 - 938 - 5173 maxwell . murphy @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . power suppliers urge changes in u . s . price - cap rules for west 2001 - 10 - 29 19 : 00 ( new york ) power suppliers urge changes in u . s . price - cap rules for west washington , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - companies that sell power in the western u . s . said the region may face blackouts this winter unless federal regulators permit them to charge more for electricity than current price limits allow . dynegy inc . , enron corp . and other power suppliers said they may not have electricity to offer during regional shortages this winter if the price caps that the federal energy regulatory commission set for california and 10 western states in april and june aren ' t eliminated or changed . they said the present limit may be too low to encourage dam owners to generate electricity . ` ` the price mitigation plan , the way it is now , will make it difficult to induce supply , ' ' g . alan comnes , director of government affairs for enron power marketing , told the commission at a conference in washington . the commission is considering changes to the pricing formula it set after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for california ' s largest utilities , units of pg & e corp . and edison international . commissioners have said they want to fine - tune the formula before winter , the peak period of demand in the northwest . the current pricing formula is based on the most - expensive power generated in california . power suppliers and utilities in the pacific northwest , which want to make sure they have enough power for customers , want the limits to reflect costs from all generators in the region . representatives for the california public utilities commission and edison international ' s southern california edison said the price limits work and should be continued . california puc ' s bill julian said the mitigation plan , due to expire sept . 30 , 2002 , should be extended until california ' s utilities are rehabilitated . prices lower the cost of wholesale power in california has dropped since ferc ordered the first emergency cap on april 25 . the average price for a megawatt - hour at the california - oregon border in september was $ 24 . 91 , down from $ 313 . 70 in april . a megawatt - hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average california homes for an hour . one adjustment under consideration would link the pricing formula to the cost of natural gas , a fuel used to generate about 25 percent of power in the western u . s . , more during low - hydropower years . the caps were extended to other western states - - oregon , washington , arizona , nevada , wyoming , new mexico , colorado , montana , idaho and utah - - in june because some said generators in the west could simply get around the cap by selling outside california when prices were higher elsewhere . - - liz skinner in washington ( 202 ) 624 - 1831 india press : enron close to deal to sell dabhol pwr proj 10 / 29 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones dow jones newswires ; 91 - 11 - 461 - 9426 ; himendra . kumar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . ferc warns that power - price controls risk shortages in northwest by bryan lee 10 / 29 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) dow jones newswires washington - - the pacific northwest could see power shortages this winter if federal price controls on western power markets aren ' t modified or dropped , electricity industry officials warned federal regulators monday . the controls , first structured to protect california from another punishing summer , are inappropriate to the northwest , where demand is highest in the winter , the officials said . " the western interconnection is an interdependent market , but that does not mean that there is or should be a single price across the market , " said richard tabors , a consultant to power suppliers and a lecturer at massachusetts institute of technology . " setting prices in the winter - peaking northwest based on prices set in summer - peaking california and the southwest makes little sense . " the caution came at a federal energy regulatory commission technical conference designed to help the agency frame possible changes to a june price - control order capping prices in california and 10 other western states . the controls work by establishing a proxy for a fair maximum market price for the entire region based on the most expensive generator called into service during power emergencies in california . the proxy - price formula takes into account the cost of natural gas fuel , emissions - control credits and the efficiency of power plants . but california , which experiences peak demand for electricity in the summer , is unlikely to run into a supply crunch again until next year . that means the price cap set in june will remain in effect throughout the winter , when the pacific northwest experiences its peak - demand period and may need the flexibility to pay higher prices to attract needed power . if the current price - control regime is maintained , it will discourage sales from the southwest to the northwest this winter , because transmission costs will drive the cost of those sales above ferc ' s price cap , mr . tabors said . california wants caps to stay officials representing california and its financially beleaguered utilities urged the commission to maintain the price - control order and to extend it beyond its october 2002 expiration date to prevent a recurrence of last year ' s power - market meltdown . the price - control regime should remain in place at least until california ' s utilities return to the market as creditworthy buyers , said fong wan of pg & e corp . ( pcg ) and bill julian of the california public utilities commission . a 10 % markup allowed to compensate for credit risks for sales into california should be dropped , because the california department of water resources , a creditworthy buyer , is purchasing electricity on behalf of the utilities , they said . ferc ' s price - mitigation order " has been very successful , " said gary stern of edison international ( eix ) unit southern california edison co . prices stabilized shortly after the controls took effect and have been capped at $ 92 per megawatt - hour since late june , the last time the california independent system operator , the state ' s grid manager , called an alert . conservation , mild weather and california ' s entry into billions of dollars in long - term power contracts have kept market prices well below that cap for the most part . ferc , however , is considering changing the pricing order to reflect the different needs of western utilities outside california . the commission is mulling whether power prices should change at times other than when california declares an emergency , perhaps to reflect fluctuations in natural gas prices . ferc also is pondering changes to the requirement that generators make all uncommitted power available to california at all times . ferc staff asked whether the so - called must - sell requirement should apply only during emergencies and whether the mandate should be balanced by a " must - pay " requirement . generators have complained that the state still hasn ' t paid for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of power delivered since the department of water resources took over the job of purchasing power for customers of california ' s largest utilities . california focus challenged absent withdrawal of ferc ' s price - mitigation order , mr . tabors and other conference participants argued for changes in the order to better account for the predominance of hydropower generation in the northwest . setting prices throughout the west based on prices in california , which gets most of its power from natural gas - fired generating plants , runs the risk of supply shortages in the northwest this winter , they said . utilities operating hydropower facilities won ' t know how much generating capacity they ' ll have for next year until february , when a reliable assessment of snowpack will be available . given the uncertainty , hydropower operators will be reluctant to release water for generation this winter . " shortages can happen this winter , " said mike naeve , an attorney with skadden arps meaghre & flom representing portland general electric co . , a unit of enron corp . ( ene ) . " prices based on natural gas may not be sufficient to release hydro you may need next year . " under the current regime , the california independent system operator , controlled by appointees of gov . gray davis , could " manipulate the market by controlling exports to the northwest , " said alan comnes of enron power marketing inc . ( ene ) . " the current price mitigation is sowing the seeds for another crisis . " ferc ' s pricing order has already been costly , said mark tallman of scottish power ' s pacificorp ( spi ) . if there is an arctic cold snap in the region this winter , price caps set by the california iso may be insufficient to assure enough supply , he said . ferc should allow prices to rise to $ 250 per megawatt - hour price cap in the northwest if capacity margins drop to emergency levels , mr . tallman said . mr . tabors and the enron officials recommended ferc adopt a $ 1 , 000 per megawatt - hour " circuit breaker " cap , such as exists in iso - administered markets in texas and the northeast . ferc ' s pricing order also was criticized for failing to account for the economics of " peaker " generating units , which only run during periods of peak demand , when prices typically spike . write to bryan lee at bryan . lee @ dowjones . com copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . 
2	Subject: enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 26 , 2001 enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub . enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a " natural fit " with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s " geographic footprint " in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . " we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' ' enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december . the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy . it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure . enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications . third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d . " the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , " said tutcher . " the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

2	Subject: re : broker client let ' s also check lavo on this . he wanted to voice his opinion at the end before we do anything . i think whalley might have an opinion too but let ' s decide as enw and ea first . thanks . gp - - - - - original message - - - - - from : richter , brad sent : thursday , august 30 , 2001 4 : 50 pm to : kitchen , louise cc : piper , greg subject : broker client louise - - in response to some considerable concern voiced by presto , we are re - evaluating our broker client relationships . i ' m planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads . it is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks , but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of eol . before i launched it , i wanted to get your thoughts . thanks , brad earlier this year , enron executed deals with certain broker ' s which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a broker client which is linked to the enrononline platform . all executions done on broker client are free of brokerage charges . to date , about 80 % of the 3 , 400 broker trades executed on - line have been in the us power segment . the companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the broker client are as follows : apb energy , inc . ( canadian nat gas , canadian power , us nat gas , us power , us coal , us emissions , us weather , us crude , us bandwidth ) natsource llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , us coal , us emissions ) amerex natural gas i , ltd . ( asian crude , bandwidth , us crude , us nat gas , belgian nat gas , canadian nat gas , european crude ) amerex power , ltd . ( australian power , austrian power , bandwidth , canadian power , dutch power , german power , nordic power , spanish power , swiss power , uk power , us power ) power merchants group , llc ( us financial nat gas ) prebon energy , inc . ( us nat gas , canadian nat gas , us power , canadian power , us coal , us emissions , us crude ) prebon marshall yamane ( uk ) ltd ( uk gas , uk power , continental power , continental gas , european crude , european weather , asian weather , asian crude , european bandwidth ) natsource tullett europe limited ( uk nat gas , uk power , continental gas , continental power , european coal ) gfi energynet llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian gas , canadian power ) tfs energy , llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , canadian power , us bandwidth ) a significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted to a free option on the part of the brokers , who will transact with enron on long - dated product only if they can ' t find an equal or better price from a supplier who will pay brokerage . while i am confident that this possibility was discussed when the deals were struck , the current situation calls for some changes . accordingly , our plan would be to exercise our right to shut down all broker clients immediately . as a result , we would be forced to return approximately $ 1 . 2 mm in fees paid by the brokers listed above . let me be clear that this does not preclude future broker client arrangements . the decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity - by - commodity and region - by - region basis . in other words , we can grant access to whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with . if particular desks have broker relationships that they would like to move on - line in support of their market , the technology and resources are available to make this happen . what we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the broker client product so that we are not employing a " one - size - fits - all " solution . i would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before we decide to proceed . thanks , brad richter

2	Subject: unify performance issues are priority number one most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as we tried to close out the month of july . not to go into any details but there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the issues we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday . almost all of the issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of sybase which is used for unify ' s database . jeff johnson and his team are putting together a plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for august . the short term tactical plans include the following : enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the amount of data grows . test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of sybase which will address some of the issues . this may also require some hardware changes as to where we store certain data . we will also need some user help in stress testing prior to moving to production . addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled . i have been told that we still have transactions going back to jan of 99 that have not been finaled or closed out . this puts quite a load on the pma and accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see what if any action should be taken with these transactions . once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little time to absorb the tremendous growth we ' ve been seeing via eol then we will focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions . these include the following : rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be much more scalable . moving off of sybase and on to microsoft sql server or oracle . it will be easier to move microsoft sql server but we have to be sure it is the right solution in the long term . jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed plan . needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best people are working on these efforts . this will slow down major enhancement efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and nominations . we will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical solutions . in the mean time feel free to contact me at x - 36858 or jeff at x - 39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail . thanks ! - tommy

' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' ' the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors . mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said . mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said . in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' ' to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed . investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 . ' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy . as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year . the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said . some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said . on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said . enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations . still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation . mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow . with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed . to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further . by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual . ' ' on wednesday , enron ' s stock fell as low as $ 7 a share , its lowest level in more than a decade . that day , news of the enron and dynegy talks leaked out . by late wednesday , the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal . but dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether enron ' s credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating . the deal moved forward yesterday after dynegy was assured enron ' s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced , according to company officials . dynegy and enron had provided standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , the main credit agencies , with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction , mr . watson said . under the deal , enron shareholders will receive 0 . 2685 share of dynegy stock for each enron share , or $ 9 . 80 based on dynegy ' s closing price on thursday . enron ' s stock gained 22 cents yesterday , to $ 8 . 63 . ' ' i never thought our stock price would be at this level , ' ' mr . lay said yesterday . enron ' s shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company , and dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company ' s 14 - member board . if the deal falls apart , enron or dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of $ 350 million . to protect dynegy ' s and chevrontexaco ' s cash infusion , the money will go to an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . if the merger is not completed , dynegy will have the right to buy the unit . an army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies . lehman brothers inc . acted as financial adviser and baker botts and akin , gump , strauss , hauer & feld acted as counsel for dynegy . j . p . morgan & company and salomon smith barney acted as financial advisers for enron , and vinson & elkins and weil gotshal & manges acted as the company ' s counsel . pillsbury winthrop served as counsel to chevrontexaco . chart : ' ' a marriage of strength and weakness ' ' a merger of enron and dynegy would bring together two of the country ' s biggest energy companies - - and save enron from potential collapse . graph tracks the weekly closes of enron shares from 1999 through 2001 . top north american gas marketers sales , of billion cubic feet per day * enron : 24 . 6 reliant : 13 . 2 duke energy : 12 . 8 bp : 12 . 3 mirant : 11 . 8 dynegy : 10 . 9 top north american power marketers sales , of million megawatt hours * enron : 212 . 5 american electric power : 134 . 5 duke energy : 118 . 1 reliant resources : 86 . 1 pg simmons natural gas week ) ( pg . c 2 ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c regulators struggle with a marketplace created by enron by jeff gerth with richard a . oppel jr . 11 / 10 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company washington , nov . 9 - - for years , the enron corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived , pushing relentlessly on capitol hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation ' s natural gas and electricity businesses . its achievement , as one enron executive said today , in creating a ' ' regulatory black hole ' ' fit nicely with what he called the company ' s ' ' core management philosophy , which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency . ' ' now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented . ' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants . ' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university . mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal . the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' ' pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates . but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions . in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' ' a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' ' enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility . for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street . in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay . now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' ' the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring . ' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' ' energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight . electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear . in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices . in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices . raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever . ' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' ' enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers . under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying . indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said . but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with . earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company . enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' ' dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market .

" in a regulatory filing on thursday , enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off - balance companies was based on " current information " , suggesting that full details had not been available before . however , a third accounting change was based on a new " assessment " , enron said , raising questions about the auditor ' s earlier judgement . under the previous commissioner arthur levitt , the sec attacked companies that indulged in " earnings management " and accountants who suffered from conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work . the accounting firms say audit and consulting work can co - exist .

" it ' s a body blow , " says charlie savino , executive vice - president of the greater houston partnership , a business organisation . enron is not only one of the city ' s biggest employers ; it has led the redevelopment of downtown houston , making it somewhere pleasant to live for the first time in decades . at the centre of its efforts is the enron field , which the company financed to bring professional baseball - and its fans - back into the city centre . on the periphery are enron ' s contributions to houston ' s social development . the company matches all employee donations made to non - profit organisations , for up to $ 15 , 000 per employee , per year . it also makes donations to non - profit organisations for which its employees offer their time . kenneth lay , enron chief executive , has long been the " go - to guy " to get something done in houston . enron ' s status brought houston status ; as the biggest energy trader in the us , it made the city the centre of energy trading . enrononline , its internet trading platform , has drawn some of the brightest minds to the city to work on what has become the world ' s biggest web - based transaction system . enron was so secure in its standing that it was building a new 40 - storey office building adjoining its 50 - storey tower . beside that , bulldozers and cranes have been putting the finishing touches to a massive new parking garage . employees had just started to move into the new towers when a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial position began to undermine the company and send investors fleeing for cover . enron staff , once known for being both brilliant and arrogant enough to prove it , are coping with their dramatic reversal in status in a wide variety of ways . as they left work yesterday , many brushed by in their smart - casual polo shirts and khakis , refusing to say a word about what was unfolding . one man , looking exhausted , braved a grin and said : " just keep smiling . the world goes on . companies go through problems all the time , just like we do in personal life . " one woman felt she had to laugh at the irony : she moved to enron last year to protect herself from job losses in the more traditional energy businesses . at that time , enron was considered the safest place to be in the industry . that dynegy , another houston - based energy trader , has emerged as enron ' s saviour is being received positively by staff , who praised its technology and processes . the houston business community may be hoping that a merged group might be better for the city than a stand - alone enron , as a combined business would be bigger and stronger . but john olson , of sanders morris harris , a local investment banking and securities firm in houston , notes that a merger is likely to lead to job losses , as assets are sold and businesses are streamlined . already , he says , many houston citizens , big holders of enron ' s stock , had lost out on its share slide .

" this would not have been my dream case , " lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . " i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . " lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes . he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities . but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state . " this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , " he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash into its operations . lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear . " it happens to be the best alternative , " said lay . " i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . " among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered . while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships . that set in motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement . watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron . that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house three days later , at which the two started talking about a deal . as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron . " i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , " watson said . " we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . " under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months : enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . based on friday ' s closing stock prices of $ 8 . 63 for enron and $ 38 . 76 for dynegy , dynegy is paying $ 10 . 41 an enron share - or a 21 percent premium . that ' s a far cry from late january when enron ' s closing price hit $ 82 a share . dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy . in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas . at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company . enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats . steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president at the combined company . the deal contains a $ 350 million breakup fee that dynegy would get if another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer . watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises . " we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , " he said . the deal must be reviewed by a variety of government regulators , though watson isn ' t expecting any antitrust problems . dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value . dynegy expects the merger to result in $ 400 million to $ 500 million in annual savings . " on paper , it looks good , " said coale , the analyst . " we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . " there are also concerns about merging two different cultures . " looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , " she said . " dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . " while both are energy traders , enron has pursued a strategy of shedding assets , while dynegy has continued to make asset purchases . at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image . but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits . the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 . it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer . the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles . days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits . then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business . as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock . that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears . thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created . . . . deal at - a - glance company name : dynegy . key players : chuck watson , dynegy ' s current chairman and ceo , will remain chairman and ceo . enron corp .

" once considered one of the shining stars of the energy business , lay has watched the company he helped create melt down around him in a matter of weeks . and as of friday , he was left to ponder an offer to serve as a member of the board for the new company formed from enron and its chief rival - no longer a chairman or a chief executive . perhaps that ' s the way he wants it . when he turned over the chief executive ' s post at enron to jeffrey skilling earlier this year , it seemed like the first move of his orderly exit from the company he had helped create in the mid - 1980 s . eleven months later , skilling is gone and lay has had to preside over the death of enron . what had begun as a stodgy natural gas pipeline company had been molded and expanded by the two men into a diversified financial giant with its hands in countless markets from oil and natural gas to water and broadband . it seemed lay , 58 , who is an economist by profession , had also cemented his reputation as an elder statesman in the energy industry , the man who had opened the business world ' s eyes to the array of possibilities that energy companies could explore for growth away from their traditional roles . with the implosion of enron in the past month , lay ' s legacy now seems tarnished . the man who was once referred to as an " energetic messiah " has been forced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival dynegy in a hastily arranged deal . lay ' s approach is reflected in the design of the building enron is constructing across from its existing tower on smith street . looking down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for lay and skilling . the offices were considered symbolic of the company ' s openness and its philosophy of melding executives with the rank and file . lay reportedly spurned the express elevator to ride to his 50 th - floor office to spend more time with employees . that sort of hands - on approach lay brought to the company may be another casualty , analysts said . " i would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day - to - day perspective , " said brian youngberg , energy analyst with edward jones in st . louis . " i think dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some enron executives . " as the dust settles on enron , the question is being raised as to whether the company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands - on fashion . " ken lay helped build enron from being just a pipeline company , but over time the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two senior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was going on in the operating companies , " youngberg said . raised on a farm in missouri , lay is well - known not just as chairman of enron but as a former undersecretary of the interior department and one of the people who has helped shape houston ' s destiny in the past 20 years . he is considered instrumental in keeping major league baseball in houston by supporting the construction of enron field . but his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped create the huge natural gas futures market in the united states , which was nonexistent as recently as the late 1980 s . he also will be remembered as the man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market and not individual fiefdoms . " ken lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his business , " said amy jaffe , a senior energy analyst with rice university ' s james a . baker iii institute for public policy . " whether his retirement is under positive or negative circumstances , he has left a huge legacy on the industry . " jaffe sees lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind power . he also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulation . he will leave enron a wealthy man , although much less so since the company ' s stock nose - dived . his current contract pays him a base salary of $ 1 . 4 million a year and a bonus of $ 7 million . it was due to expire in december 2003 . this is not the first time lay has had to rescue enron . in 1987 , enron was rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its enron oil co . had left the company holding the bag for about $ 1 billion in trading liabilities . before disclosing it to the market , the company worked the trading loss down to about $ 142 million . " we learned a lot , certainly in a bad way , " lay said of the incident in an interview earlier this year . " we put in place probably the best risk management and control system , not just in our business , but in any industry . " some see irony in the fact that dynegy ceo chuck watson will likely prevail over lay despite lay ' s almost cult status among business leaders and business school professors . " chuck watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market in the united states . he was the man who realized the enormous potential of the natural gas market , " jaffe said . " it ' s true that enron came in with a lot of advertising and built up a big position , but maybe there is some poetic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse could wind back up as the dominant player in the industry . " . . . the players 1985 - present : enron corp . , various top management posts , currently chairman and ceo 1984 - 1985 : houston natural gas corp . , chairman and ceo 1981 - 1984 transco energy co . , president and chief operating officer board memberships : compaq computer corp . , eli lilly national petroleum council member photo : ken lay copyright ? 2000 dow jones he drives a top - of - the - line mercedes . but he ' s not a showboat and isn ' t comfortable attracting attention to himself . " he doesn ' t act like a big shot , " said tilman fertitta , the chairman of landry ' s restaurants , who likes driving a bentley and zipping around in a helicopter . " chuck ' s not all caught up in the houston hustle - and - bustle thing . " like it or not , watson is about to step out in a big way . if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron for $ 8 . 85 billion in stock , watson will become captain of houston ' s largest company . he will step right into the center of the city ' s business stage , taking from enron chairman ken lay the mantle of most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have always come first . those who know watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his higher profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow . " chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it , " fertitta said . " he is not intimidated . " in fact , when longtime friend steve patterson read about enron ' s nose - dive and the collapse of its stock , he instinctively knew watson would close in on a deal . " i thought : ` you know what , chuck will try to buy enron . it just fits . it ' s the big bold move that chuck would try to make , ' " said patterson , senior vice president of the houston texans football team . watson owns 15 percent of the texans , the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder bob mcnair . watson also owns the houston aeros hockey team . like enron chairman ken lay , watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of the energy business . he was one of the early innovative forces that shaped the world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas . watson was born 51 years ago on the great lakes naval base north of chicago . his father worked for the navy , which moved the young watson clan around early and often . chuck watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine states when he graduated from oklahoma state university in 1972 with a degree in economics . after a 13 - year career at conoco , watson joined a fledgling company called u . s . natural gas clearinghouse in 1985 . ngc was a consortium of gas pipelines that had the backing of a financial - services company and a local law firm , but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company . watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the quarreling partners were bought out . watson ' s vision was to buy the gas and take title to it , aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger deals and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around . in short , the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale store for natural gas . " he is a visionary in the energy business , " said bob mcnair , a longtime friend who founded cogen technologies and later sold the company to enron for $ 1 . 1 billion . " chuck will come across as this relaxed , country person . not some sophisticate . but that is disarming . he is very creative , and he is very smart . " while ngc initially concentrated on gathering , moving and trading natural gas , the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy deregulation . now called dynegy , short for dynamic energy , the company has evolved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial users of electricity and natural gas . it also has built a communications division to capitalize on increasing demand for high - speed communication services . last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income , as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues . dynegy ' s stock climbed 218 percent last year . " the success of dynegy is a tremendous story , " patterson said . " it is amazing the growth and the value he has been able to achieve . " according to some of those who ' ve have done business with him , watson is not just bright , he is extraordinarily tough . " he is a very aggressive person , a tough negotiator . he bores in , " said george mitchell , founder of mitchell energy and the man who carved the woodlands out of the piney forest . " he is a very confident person . unlike ken lay , who is a smoother type personality who works with people , watson is going to do it his way . they are both very good business people , but they are very different . " while willing to give power to his subordinates , watson is a hands - on ceo who is unmistakably dynegy ' s commanding force . " chuck is very , very intense . . . he burns , " said former houston mayor bob lanier . " in negotiations , he gets down and learns all the details himself . " how tough watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings with houston rockets owner les alexander . watson owned the master lease to the summit , later renamed the compaq center , which committed the rockets to playing there through 2003 . eager to break the deal , alexander tried negotiating and litigating his way out of the lease , all to no avail . the battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a nhl hockey team in houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the revenues of a new stadium proposed for downtown . angered at the deal alexander was able to get for the rockets , at the expense of a hockey franchise , watson spent about $ 100 , 000 out of his own pocket to help defeat the stadium referendum . it was his one overtly political act here , and some say it was the decisive blow to alexander ' s aspirations . " there are a lot of people i ' d much rather have a contest with , " lanier said of watson . alexander and watson were later able to settle their differences , and watson supported the second arena referendum , which passed . a basketball arena is now under construction downtown . " i ' m not surprised to see chuck watson make an aggressive move like this , " alexander said friday evening . " he understands the industry as well as anyone ; and therefore , he ' s in the best position to assess the risk and take advantage of the opportunity . " like most opportunities , the deal also represents a sizable risk . taking over enron is a huge reach for dynegy , which will try to swallow a company that was five times bigger when measured by revenues . watson will need all of his shrewdness and ferocity to untangle the mess that is enron and merge two operations that were each , in their own way , trying to reinvent the energy business . " i have some concerns for my friend , " mcnair confessed . " it is a tremendous challenge . i know he ' ll handle it well , but this will be a very demanding business .

" this is basically a rogue corporation , " said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . " it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . " a failed experiment steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation . " in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , " he said . said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : " nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . " enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business . under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy . enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date . if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company . " this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , " said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings . even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general . but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said . " this is an encouraging development for the energy industry , " said stephen baum , chairman of sempra energy , the san diego - based parent of southern california gas and san diego gas ; photographer : associated press ; photo : " this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , " says charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive . ; ; photographer : associated press copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here . for watson , the deal is all about growth .

" this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .

" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , " watson said . " we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . " the recent talks , watson said , focused on really understanding enron ' s core business and how it could merge with dynegy . added lay : " good deals come together fast . bad deals take a little longer . " under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months : enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy . in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas . at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company . also at the closing , dynegy ' s current shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company , with enron ' s current shareholder ' s owning about 36 percent . enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats . steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will became an executive vice president at the combined company . the deal contains $ 350 million breakup free that dynegy would get it another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer . watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .

" at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image . but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits . the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 . it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer . the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles . days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits . then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business . as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock . that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears about a cash - crunch and the company ' s short - term stability . thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created . . . . deal at - a - glance company name : dynegy . key players : chuck watson , dynegy ' s current chairman and ceo , will remain chairman and ceo . enron corp .

" it ' s been a good ride for a long time , " lay said in a conference call last night . " the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun . " the final deal was announced after the close of stock trading . enron ' s shares - - which had fallen from $ 33 to $ 8 after the disclosures - - ended the day slightly higher , at $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s stock closed at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 . dynegy offered all stock for the enron shares , so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with dynegy ' s stock price . dynegy also said it would assume about $ 13 billion in enron debt , bringing the total value of the transaction to around $ 21 billion . dynegy ' s rescue of enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion , which will be supplied by chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy stockholder . chevrontexaco will invest another $ 1 billion in dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed , which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . the takeover agreement gives dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of enron ' s financial condition convinced him that the company ' s trading and pipeline businesses were solid . " we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it looked just as strong as we thought it was . " watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from enron . until the partnership mess , enron was the nation ' s dominant energy trader , and it had front - door political connections to the white house . lay , its longtime chairman , raised more then $ 100 , 000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend george w . bush . enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid - 1990 s , as first natural gas , and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level . its revenues leaped from $ 9 . 2 billion in 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year . during those heady times , the houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its byzantine bookkeeping . " it was always very difficult to get information , " said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . " they would always rebuff you . " until this fall , the muscular company seemed too big to stumble , said investment manager david coxe , with harris insight equity fund in chicago . coxe bought 78 , 000 shares of enron at $ 40 a share in august , after wrestling with the decision for months , he said . then jeffrey skilling , enron ' s chief executive and strategic mastermind , unexpectedly resigned . the stock , which had been as high as $ 90 in august 2000 , pitched downward . " enron seemed so indispensable to the nation ' s energy markets that i thought it inconceivable it could implode , " coxe said . " that ' s how i got sucked in . " enron ' s fall is " classic hubris , " coxe said : a greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods - - " in this case , the rules of the system . " among the rules that enron now acknowledges it didn ' t follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created . the purpose of the partnerships , enron said , was to reduce the risks of investments in internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted . the accounting errors were described in a 20 - page sec filing enron made thursday . the errors resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders ' equity . the company also said it had overstated its earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 . enron created partnerships that would buy major assets - - such as a power plant - - that enron wanted to sell , or in other cases , assets such as fiber - optic cable networks that enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet . the partnerships had outside investors , but the general partner of two of them was enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew fastow . he earned $ 30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships , according to the sec document . enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock , or securities convertible into stock . some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans , resulting in the $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholder equity , enron now says . investors are asking why enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen llp , did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place . enron ' s sec filing mentions but does not explain some " proposed audit adjustments " over the past four years that were overruled . even though , as enron now acknowledges , it created an information barrier , masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules , many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier , some analysts acknowledge . " it was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say , ' i don ' t understand it , ' " gagliardi said . the questions are now coming , from a new committee reporting to enron ' s board that will investigate how the company ' s financial reporting was handled ; from the sec ; and , eventually , from teams of lawyers representing aggrieved shareholders . lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that enron employees other than fastow had profited from the partnership activity . enron directors had approved fastow ' s management of the partnerships , but fastow quit the partnerships in july and was then replaced as chief financial officer . enron this week fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mourdant , an enron division lawyer , who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by fastow . the enron report to the sec describes a central role in these transactions played by michael j . kopper , an associate of fastow who left enron in july to take over fastow ' s financial interests in the partnership , the company said . enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovered about outside partnership investments . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial desk the nation news analysis a visionary fallen from grace james flanigan times staff writer 11 / 10 / 2001 los angeles times home edition a - 22 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company a year ago , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay was on top of the energy world . as a leading fund - raiser , contributor and energy advisor to the bush administration , he played a key role in shaping the new president ' s energy policy . as head of the world ' s largest energy trading company , he had an enormous influence on the price of energy in california and across the nation . enron ' s highflying stock helped him cash out $ 123 million in stock options last year alone . on friday , with enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . , lay ' s career and reputation are in shambles . under the merger , he will be stripped of a management job . his integrity is tattered , with enron ' s controversial financial dealings under federal investigation . enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged because the company ' s stock lost 80 % of its value in recent weeks . the rapid rise and fall of lay , 58 , is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world ' s energy markets was overcome with arrogance , associates and critics say . under lay , enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its financial collapse , they say . that in turn could have resulted in a widespread disruption in energy supplies . " enron ' s behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets . it is a very serious matter , " said edward r . muller , an energy investor and former president of edison international ' s mission energy subsidiary . " nobody denies he ' s smart , but it ' s a question of integrity , " said raymond plank , chief executive of apache corp . and an associate of lay ' s in houston ' s vibrant oil and gas industry . lay and longtime partner jeffrey k . skilling , who served briefly as enron ' s chief executive before resigning abruptly in august , rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designed to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy . lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new , market - driven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmission . the financial markets that lay and his enron associates created had an enormous effect on california ' s disastrous experiment in electricity deregulation . critics say his influence was excessive and misguided . " ken lay was a mystic , " said state sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron . " whatever he said had to make sense because he was ken lay . it was hero worship . many of the people working as economists at the federal energy regulatory commission worshiped ken lay . as a consequence , the things enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged , intellectually and otherwise . " lay , who has a doctorate in economics , had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for his children ' s education . in the navy in the late 1960 s , lay was assigned to the defense department because of his economic acumen . " he allocated pentagon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military , " said mark palmer , chief spokesman for enron . lay worked for exxon and other energy firms in the 1970 s , amid soaring oil prices , gasoline shortages and still - regulated natural gas . he headed houston natural gas , a predecessor firm of enron , in the 1980 s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for houston ' s energy industries . when the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any producer , lay turned enron into a foremost firm in the new , deregulated industry . still , enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980 s , with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling . it was then that skilling , a mckinsey ; photographer : reuters copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business dynegy timeline 11 / 10 / 2001 houston chronicle 3 star 3 ( copyright 2001 ) natural gas clearinghouse is formed by the investment banking firm morgan stanley and the law firm akin , gump , strauss , hauer & feld . six natural gas pipelines got together to create the gas marketing firm . the u . s . federal energy regulatory commission begins the long process of deregulating the natural gas business , which ultimately created huge markets for the company and competitors such as enron . ngc introduces its " energy store " concept , looking to create a one - stop shopping outlet for all energy products and services . ngc makes initial public offering . ngc acquires trident ngls . ngc merges with the natural gas business unit of chevron corp . and chevron ' s warren petroleum co . subsidiary . in february , ngc announces a deal to expand its " energy store " with the purchase of destec energy ' s interest in 20 u . s . power plants for $ 1 . 27 billion . the destec deal is the company ' s first purchase of power - generation assets .

until a few weeks ago , enron corp . was the star of the washington lobbyist corps . enron chairman ken lay was known to have the ear of his longtime friend and political ally president bush . vice president dick cheney had unveiled a national energy strategy very much to enron ' s liking , while one of the company ' s favorite electricity regulators , texas ' pat wood iii , had been installed as the new head of the federal energy regulatory commission . critics feared the houston - based energy and trading giant exerted far too much influence , both in congress and in the bush white house . now , after the company ' s implosion , enron ' s legendary political might is evaporating as well , political observers say . " just a matter of weeks or months ago , enron was still the 800 - pound gorilla , " said steven weiss , a spokesman for the washington - based center for responsive politics , a political watchdog group . " it was getting into any meeting it wanted to . " relationships are still existent , and bush is unlikely to completely ignore ken lay . but one would have to think the amount of influence that ken lay could exert now pales in comparison to the influence he could have exerted just a month or more ago . " now that dynegy has agreed to take over enron , the companies ' role in government will be determined by chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive officer . while enron has been such a player in washington , dynegy is less known inside the capital beltway . but that ' s not to say dynegy has no political pull on capitol hill . " ken lay certainly can get meetings with senators , but so can chuck watson , " a senate staffer said . while dynegy may be attracted to enron ' s energy trading whiz , the company may be desirous of enron ' s political expertise as well . while watson has had a presence on the national stage , his role in houston ' s stadium votes shows he is hardly allergic to politics . enron ' s recent troubles , however , may leave a stain . with the securities and exchange commission conducting an investigation into some of the company ' s business dealings , many politicians are likely to be wary . " politicians , perhaps better than anyone else , can smell a rotten egg , " weiss said . " who would want it reported in the newspaper that they are associated with a company that is under investigation ? " enron ' s lobbyist in washington , linda robertson , could not be reached for comment . a setback among washington ' s elite would be a novel experience for lay and other enron officials . in a city where access is everything , lay has proved - time and again - his political savvy . a one - time energy policy - maker for richard nixon , lay successfully championed deregulation of the natural gas pipeline industry and has led the effort to open up the electricity markets as well . a republican , lay served as co - chair of the host committee for the gop ' s national convention in houston in 1992 , when his friend george bush the elder was nominated for a second term . and yet there was lay a few years later , playing golf with the elder bush ' s political nemesis , bill clinton , and advising the democratic administration on energy . the company has excelled at snatching up political heavyweights as they leave public office . enron has attracted the likes of former secretary of state james baker iii and one - time clinton white house chief of staff thomas " mack " mclarty . enron ' s stable of political lobbyists became a who ' s who of washington insiders , from former christian coalition head ralph reed to one - time energy regulatory commission chairwoman elizabeth " betsy " moler . and by all accounts , enron - and lay especially - rank among the most munificent contributors to george w . bush ' s political career . lay ' s name was mentioned repeatedly as bush drew up his cabinet , and while he did not join the government , he played a role in helping craft bush ' s energy strategy . lay and other enron officials spent $ 2 . 1 million lobbying congress and the white house last year , the center for responsive politics reported . in fact , 71 senators and 188 house members have received contributions from lay and other enron officials , the watchdog group found . questions about lay ' s influence over the federal energy regulatory commission sparked an investigation last summer by congress ' general accounting office . curt hebert , then the commission chairman , accused lay of trying to prod him into changing his position on an issue of key concern to enron , open access by independent electricity generators to the power lines owned by utilities , in exchange for lay ' s political support . the gao found no evidence of wrongdoing by either party . three months after the dispute became public , hebert resigned from the commission . he was succeeded by wood , whom enron officials had championed as " smart , hard - working , fair . " just one month ago , enron ' s political muscle appeared undiminished . enron held a conference in washington on energy policy during the first week of october , attracting the likes of wood , senate energy committee chairman jeff bingaman , d - n . m . , and former energy department secretary james schlesinger . since the start of the company ' s free - fall , enron officials have been less on capitol hill , although that may have merely reflected the city ' s preoccupation with the war on terrorism and the anthrax scare . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business power play / sale suddenly switches office outlook downtown ralph bivins staff 11 / 10 / 2001 houston chronicle 3 star 1 ( copyright 2001 ) the sale of enron corp . is going to punish houston ' s downtown office market - emptying more office space at a time when several buildings are going up . enron and its purchaser , dynegy , are both hefty users of downtown office space , and with staff cutbacks likely , they will need a lot less of it . enron ' s 40 - story office tower , which is under construction on smith street , is expected to be completed next year . " if they do go through with the deal , that building is not going to be the enron building . it ' s going to become the dynegy building , " said office broker sanford criner of the trione & gordon realty firm . dynegy , which leases 700 , 000 square feet in the wells fargo plaza at 1000 louisiana , would jump at the chance to operate in the new trading floors at the new enron center south , according to a number of downtown office brokers . " there ' s no question dynegy has been looking to get a major league trading floor for a long time , " criner said . " they definitely covet the enron trading floor . " the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot enron tower is a palace of energy trading technology with miles of telecommunications cable running throughout . the building ' s matching pair of sweeping staircases were intended to lead to the corporate dens of enron chairman ken lay and former ceo jeff skilling but probably will be used by dynegy chairman chuck watson . john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said thursday that the firm ' s current wells fargo space is good and it was too soon to speculate about things like office space . " we ' re satisfied with our current location , " sousa said . a number of office brokers , however , suggest dynegy would move over to the enron building and attempt to sublease at least some of the space in wells fargo plaza . enron ' s importance to the houston office market extends beyond the new building . the company occupies about 3 million of the 42 million square feet of office space available downtown , if every small building is counted . enron occupies its existing 1 . 25 million - square - foot headquarters building at 1400 smith , 500 , 000 square feet of space in three allen center , 60 , 000 square feet in the 500 jefferson building , and 40 , 000 square feet in the 600 jefferson building . enron has already moved a few employees into its new building , which had been slated to be fully occupied by next summer . " this has some real implications , " said george carpenter of carpenter realty . " who knows , when the dust settles , where this thing is heading ? " trizechahn , which owns the cullen center and allen center properties , had been expecting enron to move out of at least a portion of those buildings when the new enron center south building was complete .

enron corp . chairman kenneth lay envisioned the four trading floors within his company ' s newly constructed silver glass tower - that was to be its new world headquarters - as an energy trading center much like the chicago mercantile exchange . " they are pretty spectacular , " enron spokeswoman karen denne said of the trading floors following the announcement of dynegy inc . ' s plans to buy enron for about $ 8 billion in stock late friday . " it is a huge state - of - the - art trading floor . they are really neat . " but the trading platforms likely won ' t be enron ' s for long . if the proposed deal between the two houston - based energy trading companies is approved , the $ 200 million , 40 - story building will be among dynegy ' s new assets in the purchase of its much larger rival . the ornate building , complete with metal sunshades and fins that deflect the sun and lower energy costs , is scheduled for completion sometime next summer . " the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , " lay said during a press conference about the merger friday at dynegy ' s headquarters just a few blocks away from where an oval shaped skybridge encircles smith street . the enclosed , air conditioned bridge connects what was to be enron ' s new headquarters with its current building on the opposite side of the street . enron had long - term plans to complete its urban campus with a third tower after building a second tower in 1999 , the first major office building project in downtown houston in more than a decade . lay and his former chief executive officer , jeff skilling , were to have seventh - floor offices overlooking the trading floors . two curved grand stairways connect the offices to the floors below . but enron ' s future started changing shortly after skilling ' s surprise resignation in august . last month enron reported major losses in third quarter earnings . the company ' s stock then tumbled 80 percent in the past three weeks as investors grew increasingly concerned that serious financial problems were being hidden from shareholders through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . a day after lay expressed his confidence in his chief financial officer andrew fastow , who managed those partnerships , fastow was ousted in an attempt to regain investor confidence . it didn ' t work , and skilling has since been called to testify before the sec about the partnerships . then dynegy stepped in , and one houston company came to the rescue of another , prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said . " enron needed dynegy . they needed a rescuer , " coale said . " the run on enron stock was similar to a run on a bank . once things start to capitulate it can run right down into liquidity . " while dynegy says its too early to discuss layoffs , what happens to the name of the houston astros ' enron field or the future uses for enron ' s buildings , university of houston economist barton smith doubted the company will let the prime real estate go unused . " at one time ken lay and his family had a vision of houston having an energy exchange and i think that vision is going to continue , " smith said . " this brings dynegy , which was a relatively small player , in as a pretty strong force . " smith said reductions in philanthropic giving are likely . enron has contributed to many texas schools , including the university of houston , rice university , the university of texas and southern methodist university . while the company ' s philanthropy has gained fans in texas , many in california , plagued by power shortages earlier this year , still resent enron for its outspoken support of deregulation . " the principles of karma seem to be working here , " said harvey rosenfield , founder of a california consumer advocacy group . " here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . " texas economists say ripple effects of the dynegy - enron merger on houston ' s economy will be minimal , even if the combination forces layoffs . " there are some recessionary pressures going on in the united states , but houston is probably in a better position than any city i know of to dampen those pressures , " said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university . " the houston market is unique in that aspect . " but michelle michot foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said the nation ' s fourth - largest city isn ' t immune to a weakening national economy . " we do have a three - pronged problem in town , which is continental , compaq and enron , " she said . " but there is no way this is as bad as ( the oil bust years of ) 1986 and 1987 . " houston - based continental airlines has cut 12 , 000 jobs and reduced its flight schedule in the wake of sept . 11 ' s attacks in new york , washington d . c . and pennsylvania . meanwhile , hewlett - packard is attempting to buy compaq , also based in houston , which could result in additional layoffs from the computer maker .

" people are looking to texas as the next iteration of retail competition . a lot of states have pulled back after the california experience , " says brett perlman , a member of the public utility commission . " if texas is successful , texas will become the model for the nation . " ken malloy , president of a pro - deregulation think tank called the center for the advancement of energy markets , called texas the state to watch . " california obviously created a domino effect , " leading other states to delay deregulation , malloy said . " a lot of people are placing a lot of hope on texas . " texas officials say that unlike california , which must import much of its power , texas imports little and has built more than 50 new power plants since 1995 , providing an important cushion . texas also made it easier for power generators and resellers to negotiate long - term contracts , which officials say will help lock in lower prices . and texas provides more - digestible price information , making it easier for consumers to comparison - shop , they say . california officials warn that texans may be a little too smug . they spot trouble already in texas , including california - style price spikes in some spot markets for electricity - a clear sign , they say , that power companies are learning how to maximize profits by forcing prices up . " there are things that can be done by people who own the power to create a shortage , and if they see an opportunity to make money doing that they will , " said john rozsa , an aide to state sen . steve peace , who was heavily involved in california ' s deregulation debate . california officials accuse the power companies - many of them texas - based - of withholding supplies or clogging transmission lines to drive prices higher . they say the same techniques could be used in texas . supporters and opponents of deregulation do agree that the stakes will be high in texas for power companies and consumers . " if the wheels fall off , it would be hard to put it back together , " says bob manning , an executive with san antonio - based h - e - b grocery co . , which hopes to cut its $ 40 million annual electricity bill through deregulation by at least 6 percent . the idea behind electric deregulation is simple and powerful . instead of forcing residents and businesses to buy their power from a monopoly such as txu electric or reliant , let them choose among several competing companies . in theory , competition should cause prices to fall , as it did for air travel and long - distance phone service . that ' s what the texas legislature thought when it voted in 1999 to let utility customers pick a new power company beginning jan . 1 , 2002 . power traders led by enron corp . lobbied heavily for deregulation , figuring they could profit by gaining a chunk of the utilities ' business even though enron produces little power itself . to prepare for deregulation , the legislature approved a seven - month pilot program in which a few commercial and residential customers would be able to switch . soon , glaring problems emerged . the trial program was delayed three times . when it finally began this summer , the state ' s main power grid struggled to switch customers to their new power company . prices for backup power used on hot summer days temporarily jumped 100 - fold . through it all , the public utility commission and the power companies and their allies have insisted the pilot program was serving its purpose of highlighting potential problems . " anytime you buy a new home there are a whole bunch of things you need to get fixed before you move in , " perlman said this week . " we ' re going down that punch list , and i think we ' ll be ready on jan . 1 . " the unresolved issues , he said , include how utilities such as txu and reliant will pass on the cost of fuel to their customers , who were guaranteed a 6 percent rate cut on jan . 1 . in addition to the technical setbacks , deregulation suffered a blow when shell energy , a unit of the anglo - dutch energy giant , pulled out of texas after signing up 40 , 000 customers . suddenly one of the biggest players and a potent competitor to txu and reliant had vanished . shell has said that doing business in texas became uneconomical after other states delayed deregulation . " that was a bit bizarre , because they had spent a lot of money to attract customers , " said brian lloyd , a top puc official on pricing issues . " but if they don ' t want to be here , we don ' t want them . " lloyd and other puc officials are confident that as deregulation catches on , other power companies will move in to texas , ensuring strong competition . already , however , deregulation will be delayed beyond jan . 1 because of a lack of competition and questions about power - transmission in a section of southeast texas served by entergy corp . and in a stretch of northeast texas served by southwestern electric power co . last month , consumers union , aarp and other groups asked the puc to delay competition everywhere in texas because of computer glitches and billing problems during the pilot program . deregulation advocates worry that residential customers will simply stay with their old electric utility , causing new competitors to fail . the puc is likely to push ahead after receiving a final round of comments next week from electric companies and officials of the main power grid , called the electric reliability council of texas , or ercot . along with the power traders , large commercial customers - like the h - e - b grocery chain - figure to be winners . " a grocery store is an energy hog , " manning said . " we have a lot of refrigerators that run 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . we help ( the power companies ' ) bottom line . " perlman , the puc member , predicted deregulation will start on time but said that making it trouble - free was the most important goal to build consumer confidence .

' ' dynegy agreed to the terms after moody ' s investors service maintained an investment grade rating on enron today , eliminating a stumbling block in negotiations . cash crunch moody ' s announcement removed the threat that a junk rating would force enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds . enron has been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor confidence because of questions about partnerships started by its senior executives . enron fired chief financial officer andrew fastow in october as a securities and exchange commission investigation focused in on partnerships he headed and helped create . enron estimated fastow made $ 30 million through partnerships affiliated with the company . the sec began the investigation after enron reduced third - quarter earnings by more than $ 1 billion and said dealings with two partnerships had lowered shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . ` ` clearly , ( the partnerships ) created quite a perception problem for the company , and maybe more serious problems than that , ' ' lay said on a conference call after the buyout announcement . ` ` we ' ll see over time .

' ' energy trading markets ` ` are relatively fragmented ' ' so there should be no antitrust problems , even though enron and dynegy are big companies , said robert burka , a washington - based antitrust attorney with foley & lardner . ` ` enron may well not be a healthy company going forward ' ' if the merger isn ' t approved , burka said . enrononline the combination of the two companies will leave watson with control of enrononline , an internet energy and commodities trading site that has done more than $ 880 billion in trades since it was created in november 1999 . ` ` it ' s not perfectly capturing the value of enron , but if you ' re on the board at enron at this point , you take it and move on , ' ' said correnti of wayne hummer investments . the total value of the stock portion of the transaction could rise , depending how many enron shares need to be converted in the stock swap . an enron spokesman said the company had 913 million shares on a fully diluted basis , though a person familiar with the talks said enron ' s stock price is so low that many common share equivalents won ' t be converted , leaving the number at 743 million shares . lehman brothers inc . is dynegy ' s financial adviser on the transaction . salomon smith barney inc . and j . p . morgan & co . are advising enron . - - margot habiby in houston ( 713 ) 353 - 4872 dynegy announces $ 8 billion deal to buy larger rival enron by juan a . lozano associated press writer 11 / 09 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt . the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders . under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said . " with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase . watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books . " as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , " watson said . enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals , and fiber - optic bandwidth . dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities . at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles . " we looked under the hood and , guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , " watson said . under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne . that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse . in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged . dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder . the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of " non - core " enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson said it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts . enron has about 20 , 000 employees , while dynegy ' s work force is about 6 , 000 . watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . dynegy ' s steve bergstrom will continue as president . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through . dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron . " few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , " whalley said . " together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . " the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . " there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , " said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities . early friday , moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the company ' s long - term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade . in an sec filing , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 " should not be relied upon " and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports . the revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion . the revisions also increased the company ' s debt each of the four years , reaching $ 10 . 86 billion - $ 628 million more than previously reported - by the end of 2000 . keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity . but the company ' s stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high - speed internet unit foundered and enron had trouble collecting money from power customers in india . the stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , and news of the sec investigation surfaced . enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence , but investors dumped enron shares and sent its stock plummeting . the ousted chief financial officer , andrew fastow , ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com http : / / www . dynegy . com ap graphic dynegy enron copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 3 - dynegy to acquire enron for $ 9 bln . 11 / 09 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( adds new material from news conference , new analyst comments ) by andrew kelly houston , nov . 9 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . agreed on friday to acquire rival enron corp . for some $ 9 billion in stock , underlining the dramatic reversal of fortunes for the houston - based energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly $ 80 billion . enron ' s stock fell sharply in the past month due to investors ' concerns about murky transactions that sparked an investigation by u . s . regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating agencies . " it ' s an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable story , " said fulcrum global partners analyst michael barbis . " the company that created the industry is gone - it ' s all dynegy now . " the merged company will retain the dynegy name . it will have annual revenues of more than $ 200 billion and assets worth $ 90 billion , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipelines . it will be north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity , positions previously held by enron . dynegy will control the new 14 - member board , holding 11 of its seats , and the top executive positions . chevrontexaco corp . , a 26 . 5 percent stakeholder in dynegy , will provide an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to keep enron ' s core trading operations afloat and a further $ 1 billion when the deal closes . it will get three board seats . dynegy ' s watson firmly in control the deal puts chuck watson , dynegy ' s pioneering chairman and chief executive who has long labored under enron ' s shadow , firmly in charge of the new company . " it is a great deal for dynegy and , under the circumstances , as a good of a deal as enron could get , " said ubs warburg analyst ron barone . watson will remain chairman and chief executive of the merged company , while dynegy ' s president , steve bergstrom , and chief financial officer , rob doty , will retain those positions . greg whalley , president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president and will join watson , bergstrom and doty in the office of the chairman . barbis said that after enron saw its stock fall 75 percent over the last month , cutting its market capitalization by $ 19 billion , the company was left in a weak negotiating position . " at the end of the day they had no choice , " he said . dynegy will swap 0 . 2685 shares of its own stock for each enron share , valuing houston - based enron at $ 10 . 41 per share , a premium of 21 percent over friday ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 . the price is far below a lofty high of $ 90 . 56 set on aug . 23 , 2000 , when enron was riding a wave of investor enthusiasm . dynegy stockholders will own about 64 percent and enron stockholders will own about 36 percent of the merged company . regulators probe enron deals enron had been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off - balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . enron chairman and chief executive ken lay told a news conference in houston that he would have preferred enron to retain its independence but that this had become impossible in the face of a " consistent barrage of really negative articles " . " the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , " said lay , adding that he had not yet decided whether to take up watson ' s offer of a seat on the merged company ' s board . watson said the agreement with enron includes " escape clauses " that would allow dynegy to back out of the deal if any further undisclosed problems were to emerge , but he said he was confident that this would not happen . " you know , we looked under the hood and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we though it was , " he said . watson said he did not expect the merger to run into serious regulatory obstacles . " regulatory agencies realize that a speedy resolution is important to keep stability in the u . s . energy market . this has got to be resolved , " said ubs warburg analyst barone . dynegy said it expects the new company to earn $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 per share in 2002 , an increase of 35 percent , or 90 cents to 95 cents per share , for current dynegy shareholders , before taking into account expected synergies and cost savings . dynegy estimates annual pretax savings of $ 400 million to $ 500 million as a result of the sale or winding down of non - core businesses in the enron portfolio and other measures . watson said he did not yet know how many jobs might be cut as a result of combining the two companies . the merger still requires approval by regulators and both sets of shareholders but is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002 . lehman brothers was financial advisor to dynegy . j . p . morgan chase and salomon smith barney , a unit of citigroup , were financial advisors to enron . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron not california ' s largest power supplier , but merger could affect prices by karen gaudette associated press writer 11 / 09 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . san francisco ( ap ) - when houston - based dynegy inc . announced friday that it had bought enron , its larger rival for $ 7 . 8 billion shares of stock , some energy traders predicted fluctuating power prices in the coming months throughout the west as the market settles into a new hierarchy with one fewer provider . " the fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn everything upside down very easily , " said gary ackerman , executive director of the western power trading forum , of which enron is a member . " a week ago i don ' t think many people would have even contemplated this . " the loss of houston - based enron will " make prices more jumpy and more uncertain and it ' s going to take the market some time to calm down , " ackerman said . should the northwest have a chilly winter , prices could spike with fewer sellers in the market , he said . and that in turn could affect california ' s pocketbook , though the state buys a negligible amount of electricity from enron , said oscar hidalgo , spokesman for the state department of water resources , which buys electricity for the customers of two financially ailing utilities . hidalgo said the state had a long - term contract with enron earlier this year though the marketer opted out of it after a month . " they have indicated to us that we were somewhat of a credit risk for them , like many generators at the time , " hidalgo said . earlier this year , enron attempted to cancel its contract as electricity and natural gas provider to california ' s two public university systems , which spent more than $ 170 million combined last year on the fuels . it was unclear friday what would happen to those contracts . enron ' s reach in california goes beyond keeping the lights on . the state ' s retirement pension fund owns 3 million shares of enron stock - about 1 percent of its total investments - said calpers spokeswoman pat macht . the calpers board will meet next week to discuss the situation , she said . " i can only say at this point that we were as surprised and shocked as the rest of the world was about what has been going on there and we ' re assessing our options , " macht said . enron corp . ' s outspoken support for deregulation of the country ' s electricity markets sparked resentment in california as rolling blackouts swept through earlier this year , although the energy marketer is not one of california ' s largest power providers . some felt the financial downfall of the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and major electricity seller was justified . " the principles of karma seem to be working here , " said harvey rosenfield , founder of the santa monica , calif . - based consumer advocacy group the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights . " here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . " earlier this year , california attorney general bill lockyer subpoenaed enron ' s electricity trading records as he sought to prove the state was the victim of price gouging which led officials to spend more than $ 9 billion buying electricity for the customers of two financially troubled utilities . enron repeatedly denied all accusations of market manipulation . enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy - enron merger could mean name change for enron field by kristen hays associated press writer 11 / 09 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - the houston astros ' stadium won ' t be nicknamed " home run field " much longer . houston - based energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy enron corp . , the $ 100 million namesake of the astros ' ballpark . the companies will operate independently until the deal closes , possibly next summer . the new company will keep dynegy ' s name and lose enron ' s - and houston ' s $ 251 million ballpark could see the same change , astros owner drayton mclane jr . said . mclane said the team ' s 30 - year naming rights agreement with enron allows another company to give the ballpark a new name in case of a merger . the astros have the right to approve or reject a change . " we want to work with ( dynegy chairman and chief executive ) chuck watson and we look forward to working with dynegy , " mclane said . watson said the ballpark name wasn ' t an issue as the companies hammered out the merger agreement this week . " quite honestly , it has not come up , " watson said friday . " this is about two strong companies going forward . it is something we will have to deal with in the months coming up . " since opening before the 2000 season , enron field has become known as one of the best parks for hitters in the majors . there have been 496 homers hit in enron the past two years , 19 percent more than in astros road games . coincidentally , houston ' s other company - named sports facility also is in question . the corporate namesake of the compaq center basketball / hockey arena , compaq computer corp . , is being bought by hewlett - packard co . enron field wouldn ' t be the first venue to change names because of a merger or other corporate decision by the naming - rights owner . corestates arena , home to the philadelphia 76 ers and the philadelphia flyers , became first union arena when first union corp . acquired corestates financial corp . in 1998 . marine midland arena in buffalo , n . y . , became hsbc arena last year because marine midland in 1999 changed its name to hsbc bank usa as part of a global branding strategy . such changes are inevitable when 61 major league sports facilities bear corporate names in an age of many mergers and acquisitions , said dean bonham of the bonham group in denver , a sports and entertainment marketing firm . " mergers and acquisitions had no effect on the sports industry just 10 years ago , " he said . " today they can have a significant affect on the community beyond the direct impact on the company itself .

2	Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01 executive summary ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for past utility debt ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short for pg & e this summer ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions for california california public utility commission rate increases today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption , but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr , which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10 billion worth of state bonds . davis & pg & e at odds sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) , and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would provide davis with even less negotiating power . with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation . davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later . qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates . out with hebert , in with wood the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood . the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and power plant installation . it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as bpa .

" the government , way back in 1995 , has modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha at reduced rates within the state , " government sources added . sources said that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent . the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year 2000 . sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden . they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with dpc . " if the state finance department sticks to its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , " sources from the state energy department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and $ 18 . 87 of premium . dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . " sales tax is a pass through and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the consumers , " he added . - - - - - - - centre yet to receive proposal on enron thursday jan 18 2001 centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said " we have not received any proposal . " " we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete proposal before intervening in this matter , " parbhu said on the sidelines of greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied " what will the ptc do with the power ? " prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114 crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .

2	Subject: ecp / linden swaps here ' s my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps : as i indicated earlier , the original $ 32 mm was put on for the linden 6 expansion which never occurred . the second swap of $ 350 mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from el paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly . this hedge does appear to have been set with the el paso payment stream in mind . the original $ 32 mm of swaps did not provide a clean hedge to the remaining el paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the el paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer . however , the $ 382 mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged . it appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time , a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the " dirty " interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time . given that the monetization never occurred , it does appear to me that the $ 32 mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note . anyone have anything additional to add ? that ' s the best i could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures .

2	Subject: good day , good day , with warm heart i offer my friendship , and my greetings , and i hope this letter meets you in good time . it will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally . however , i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction , which i propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity . my name is wolny olkusz , the first son of olkusz , of the most popular black farmer from zimbabwe , murdered in the land dispute in my country . as led by my instinct , i decided to contact you through email , after searching for contacts via the internet , as it is the only means i can contact anybody since i am cutting off ties with zimbabwe for security and safety reasons . however , i apologise if this is not acceptable to you . the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture . due to the l and and political problems in zimbabwe , as a result of president robert mugabe ' s introduction of new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers , and his desire to hold on to power for life , my father for saw the danger that came in zimbabwe . before he was murdered , he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in major companies . we then went to south africa to deposit the sum of us $ 22 . 5 million ( twenty - two million , five hundred thousand us dollars ) , in a private security company . this money was deposited with this private security company for safety and security reasons , and was to be used for the purchase of land , new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in europe . president mugabe ' s support for the violent zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society , led to the murder of my beloved father and other i nnocent lives . i was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered . i rested for a while , but when the danger became unbearable , and i survived two murder attempts , i fled zimbabwe . i am currently staying in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum . in fact my decision to come here to seek asylum , is because the security company from south africa , has a branch in holland and they have moved the deposit from their office in johannesburg down here . i need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money . since the law of nether land prohibits a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction , this is why i am seeking a genuine and reliable partner , whose account this money can be transferred , hence this proposal to you . you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future and in yo ur hands , as a result of the safe keeping of this money . if you accept to assist me , all i want you to do for me , is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office in netherlands , as it has now been transfered from johannesburg , south africa to their branch here . the company will be legally informed of you representing me . for your assistance , i have two options for you . firstly you can choose to have 10 % of the money for your assistance , and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here , or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever the option you want , please to notify me in your reply . i have also set aside 1 % ( $ 225 , 000 , 00 ) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction , and 4 % ( $ 900 , 000 , 00 ) for charity donation . if you prefer to accept th e 10 % for assisting with opening an account , then 85 % will be left in the account here for me . please , i want you maintain the absol ute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction . i look forward to your reply and co - operation , and i thank you in advance as i anticipate your co - operation . you can reach me on via email theolkuszfamily @ netscape . net , sincerely , wolny olkusz join excite ! - http : / / www . excite . comthe most personalized portal on the web !

2	Subject: article on gas marketers : top gas gorillas note the discussion on market share halfway through the article . top gas gorillas show strong volume growth the year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing , with huge increases in gas prices , enormous volatility , continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits . physical gas sales volumes for the top 20 marketers in ngi ' s ranking grew 17 % to nearly 150 bcf / d , and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as williams reporting 2 , 000 % profit increases in their energy merchant segments . however , for many of the smaller players it was a tough year . " the big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand , " said ben schlesinger , president of maryland - based consulting firm schlesinger and associates , which tracks energy marketing . " these people have price exposure on both sides of their business : the buy side and sell side . they ' ve actively sought to hedge these risks , but there ' s no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in 2000 . " significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue , not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of 500 marketing companies , predicted schlesinger . " for the first time i ' m not sure all 500 will make it because of the price volatility , and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers . " if you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in california , you are going to suffer significantly . it ' s not much different at the henry hub either , he noted . the harsh reality is that only the strong will survive . ronald j . barone of ubs warburg believes the california energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers . " i think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players , such as enron . customers want to go with somebody who is big , has facilities , somebody who is going to guarantee it , somebody who can do risk management for them . enron is the 800 - pound gorilla here . " enron has been the 800 - pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of 750 - pound gorillas around . last year , however , enron found a way to trade natural gas over the internet and at last glance was well over 1 , 600 pounds , more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla , duke energy . enron sold 23 . 8 bcf / d of gas last year compared to only 13 . 3 bcf / d the year prior and compared to the 11 . 9 bcf / d sold by duke energy , which came in second place in ngi ' s ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume . enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool , enrononline , its web - based proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about 3 , 000 mainly natural gas transactions each day . in 2000 , enron completed its first full year of deploying enrononline , which quickly became the world ' s largest web - based e - commerce site . during the year , enron executed 548 , 000 transactions online with 3 , 000 customers , totaling $ 336 billion of gross value . the tremendous success of enrononline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry . when you look at enron ' s massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration . enron ' s 23 . 8 bcf / d is pretty large ( 35 % ) when compared with the 69 bcf / d that is actually consumed in north america . but you have to factor in multiple trades - - - one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on . according to schlesinger , the so - called " churning factor " is close to three . " in the past several years when we ' ve been polling marketers , we got numbers ( in 1999 ) that came to about 60 tcf . we added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies . we did not have 100 % response in our survey - - - some of the mid - sized and smaller companies didn ' t respond . we reasonably extrapolated that about 65 tcf , maybe even 70 tcf of gas was traded each year in north america . physical consumption in north america is about 25 tcf so 70 divided by 25 is about 2 . 8 . " using that calculation , enron with 23 . 8 bcf / d of physical gas sales in 2000 ends up with a not unreasonable 12 % market share . when the federal trade commission looks at markets and market share , it uses several tools , one of which is the herschman - herfindahl index , a measure of market concentration . it ' s the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant . if one company owns the entire 100 % of the market , that ' s an hhi of 10 , 000 . the department of justice has been using 1 , 800 as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions . according to schlesinger , the total gas industry has an hhi of only about 200 , way below any suggestion of market concentration . " it ' s so low that it ' s unbelievable . it ' s a highly competitive business . even if one competitor has 12 % of the market ( hhi of 144 ) and the next competitor has 6 % and on down , it certainly doesn ' t send up any red flags , " he said . " it could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in 2000 , but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the united states . however , there may be some regional issues we have to think about , " he added . " we haven ' t looked at that , so i can ' t comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state , for example . " there is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers . the leaders keep getting larger . volume growth averages at least 10 % per year or more . several factors should fuel future growth . price increases , volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers , according to both schlesinger and barone . online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place . schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the 17 % increase in volumes . enron attributed much of its growth to the online business . according to some observers , online trading still has plenty of room to grow . altra energy ceo paul bourke believes about 30 % of all gas trading now takes place over the internet . bourke said altra had 8 , 000 natural gas trades on its system in december . however barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the united states as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers . " international should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line , " he said . barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service , supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together . " i think size , scope and scale are incredibly significant . " only one of the top 20 major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors : axia , which grew out of the combination of koch energy and entergy . the rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers . thirteen out of the 20 top marketers showed double - or triple - digit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column . pg & e had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a 40 . 1 % decline in annual volumes and a 42 % decline in quarterly volumes . pg & e went through a significant reorganization last year . the move of its national energy group ( neg ) to bethesda , md , from houston , had the greatest impact on its trading activity . but the company also sold its energy services business and its texas gas transmission assets among other changes . " it really slowed down our trading [ and ] a large number of people stayed behind in houston , " said company spokesman patrick hurston . at the time of the move , the company estimated about half , or 100 , would make the move . hurston wouldn ' t say how many actually made the trip , but the company is still actively hiring . transcanada , which also underwent a massive reorganization last year , was the other company in the minus column with a 3 % decline in sales volume . the remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes : enron at 94 % , duke with 15 % growth , sempra with 51 % and bp amoco with 100 % growth .

2	Subject: global entelligence status just want to give you a couple of updates . the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser and chris gaskill yesterday . the overall response was very positive . based on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end of the week . the cost for the d & b data has been reduced by $ 100 k after additional negotiations . pursuant to that , the agreement was signed last week . the requested data was received yesterday . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mary solmonson / hou / ect on 03 / 21 / 2000 09 : 55 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary solmonson 03 / 07 / 2000 05 : 50 pm to : greg whalley / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : global entelligence status just wanted to let you know a few updates : 1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks . 2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining phases . 3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k . i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money . therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their development resources off of this project until they receive a signed agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep them moving or sign the proposal at that time . give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items .

' ' related - party transactions , ' ' as the accountants call them , are fraught with conflicts of interest . though much remains to be learned about these transactions , their scope and lack of transparency suggest that enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading . the extent to which company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear . enron has scrambled to dampen wall street ' s concerns , acknowledging its credibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses . on wednesday it brought in william powers , the dean of the university of texas school of law , to review the transactions . the securities and exchange commission has launched its own formal investigation . mr . fastow was forced to resign , following jeffrey skilling , the man credited with driving enron into new cutting - edge businesses , out the door . enron ' s former admirers on wall street , mindful of recent scandals involving high - profile companies doctoring their earnings , and of the spectacular collapse of the long - term capital management hedge fund in 1998 , are alarmed . carole coale of prudential securities summed up the prevailing sentiment when she told the times : ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose facts . ' ' analysts , as well as the media , are not entirely blameless . enron did mention , albeit in passing , the troubling related - party deals as early as march 2000 . but few analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company ' s revenues , profits and stock price were soaring . harvey pitt , the new securities and exchange commissioner , must pursue the enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as vigilant as his predecessor , arthur levitt , when it comes to protecting the integrity of financial markets . indeed , even if enron is cleared of any wrongdoing and regains some of its past luster , as it well might , the company that preaches the merits of self - regulating marketplaces has reminded us all of the need for a strong regulator on wall street . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . november 12 , 2001 finance business week the enron debacle byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit ' s credibility executives at high - flying enron corp . ( ene ) never seemed overly concerned with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices . earlier this year , the california attorney general had to get a court order to collect documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing . and when an analyst challenged former ceo jeffrey k . skilling in a conference call to produce enron ' s balance sheet , skilling called him an " ass - - - - . " still , even some enron executives worried that the company had gone too far with two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge investments . with enron ' s then - chief financial officer acting as general manager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their investments , the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from investors seemed overwhelming . " internally , everybody said this is not a good idea , " says a source close to the company . but no one could have predicted such a jaw - dropping outcome for the nation ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . since oct . 16 , when enron revealed a $ 35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnerships and was forced to knock $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholders ' equity , the company ' s stock has plunged 60 % . the securities its highly ballyhooed business for trading high - speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom industry meltdown ; and its calamitous foray into the water business with azurix corp . has already cost enron at least $ 574 million in write - offs . these bad bets and the expensive ljm shock have investors worried about what else might be lurking at enron . many aren ' t sticking around to find out . " i think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the credibility of the management team , " says richard a . giesen , who manages the munder power plus fund , which dumped its enron shares about a month ago . it ' s not clear just how many off - balance - sheet financing vehicles enron has used over time . some were created years ago to finance oil and gas producers . analysts and sources close to the deals say there ' s no particular risk in these to enron shareholders . other interconnected entities , such as whitewing , osprey , atlantic water trust , and marlin water trust , were a way to get assets no longer central to enron ' s strategy off its balance sheet , freeing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broadband ( table ) . to entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into these deals , enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren ' t enough to cover debt . such " mandatory equity " deals have been used by at least a half - dozen others in the energy and telecom industries , including el paso ( epg ) , williams , and dominion , says standard & poor ' s director todd a . shipman . " nobody ' s going to find anything that ' s particularly unique or below board " in such deals , says one investment banker specializing in the energy business . worst case , which shipman considers unlikely , enron could be on the hook for about $ 3 billion in its mandatory - equity deals . that could mean diluting its shares by more than 25 % at today ' s prices . analyst john e . olson at sanders morris harris inc . ( smhg ) figures a 9 % dilution is more likely . even if this $ 3 billion in debt were included on enron ' s balance sheet now , the debt - to - capital ratio would climb to 54 % from about 49 % at the end of june . such a change would pressure enron ' s credit rating but not push it below investment grade , says shipman . huge hit . fastow ' s ljm , a private equity fund , was a different kind of animal , according to sources familiar with the arrangements . it bought energy and other assets from enron , which booked gains and losses on those deals . ljm was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the volatility of some of enron ' s investments , including stakes in high - tech and telecom businesses and an interest in new power co . , which markets power to consumers . when enron terminated these deals in september , it took the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . but the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with the company . the first place that might show up is in enron ' s highly successful online platform , which trades everything from gas and electricity to weather derivatives . to reassure its partners , enron is scrambling to shore up its liquidity . it has already tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines and is trying to arrange another $ 1 billion . shipman says he has seen no signs of massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms . still , rival traders are wary . " we certainly have taken a closer look at enron in the last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk , but we ' re still doing business with the company as usual , " says keith g . stamm , ceo of power and gas trader aquila inc . ( ila ) " speeding train . " still , with the stock battered and rating agencies considering further downgrades , that could rapidly change . in recent days , the uncertainty about enron ' s future has reduced investors ' appetite for enron debt . " no one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of survival , " says a credit - derivatives salesperson . " it ' s really difficult to get in front of a speeding train . " even if lay can calm his trading partners , he and his management team face a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on wall street . with the stock now hovering around $ 14 - - down from a high of $ 90 in august , 2000 - - some even believe that enron could be a takeover target for the likes of ge capital or royal dutch / shell group . ( rd ) both declined to comment . would enron sell ? one source close to the company says enron has talked about possible mergers and strategic alliances in the past with royal dutch / shell , among others . " if they ' re really worried about liquidity , they might take the easy way out , " he says . if enron does pull through this crisis , some suspect it will be a humbler , more risk - averse place . the company that once believed it could expand its trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities - - from advertising space to steel - - will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions . that ' s something some investors applaud . " the company should focus on its strengths , " says william n . adams , senior energy analyst at banc of america capital management , a major shareholder . but that ' s a far less exciting place than enron ' s energy cowboys ever hoped to roam . by stephanie anderson forest and wendy zellner in dallas , with heather timmons in new york november 12 , 2001 finance business week derivatives danger ? lately , owners of enron ' s ( ene ) equity , bonds , and loans have been struggling to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they didn ' t know about before . now , as a fuller picture of enron ' s entanglements with partnerships begins to emerge , investors have something else to worry about : credit default swaps , known as cdss for short . that ' s financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans . their owners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they have if their investments go bad . the cds market has existed only for about two years , but it ' s growing fast . goldman , sachs & co . ( gs ) and others estimate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $ 1 trillion and $ 1 . 5 trillion are covered . not surprisingly , big banks with hefty balance sheets such as j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) , merrill lynch ( mer ) , and deutsche bank ( db ) dominate the market . enron , however , is a player - - and the only significant one that isn ' t also a bank . competitors say that although enron has issued only between $ 500 million and $ 700 million worth of cdss so far this year , it had ambitious plans to offer them online . " they don ' t belong in this market , " says one trader . " they don ' t understand the implications . " enron did not return calls seeking comment . of course , neither enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans and bonds they ' re insuring turn bad . trouble is , this year is potentially a doozie for losses on corporate debt . corporate defaults could reach a record of $ 100 billion , says standard & poor ' s , like businessweek a unit of the mcgraw - hill companies . regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $ 193 billion by early october . if enron has insured any of the bad debt , it might have to take charges for losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting . with all that has been happening in recent weeks , that ' s the last thing it needs . by heather timmons in new york november 12 , 2001 finance by mike mcnamee commentary : enron ' s clout won ' t sway the sec for securities & exchange commission chairman harvey l . pitt , the sec ' s investigation into enron corp . ( ene ) could hardly have come at a worse time . the future of pitt ' s ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation could depend on how well he handles this case . enron ' s political clout and close ties to president george w . bush create real risks for the sec . enron ceo kenneth l . lay is a longtime bush backer , and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the president ' s campaign . a bush appointee , pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act . he has made it clear he wants to speed up the sec ' s enforcement , in part by rewarding companies that cooperate with probes . but he insists the sec will still come down hard on true corporate miscreants - - and knows that any signs of let - up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda . enter the enron probe . the fine shadings of securities enforcement - - where most cases are settled by negotiated penalties , not court - imposed fines - - often make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the sec is being tough or lenient . but pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the enron case is handled by the book - - getting the same strict scrutiny from the sec as any other , less connected company . for now , top sec aides say that ' s happening . the sec enforcement div . in washington is looking into whether enron adequately disclosed to shareholders the risks of its complex deals with andrew s . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer . agency insiders say pitt and his fellow commissioners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds . but they insist pitt hasn ' t heard from the white house or enron ' s other political allies . top lobbyist . enron ' s connections are numerous . besides lay ' s links to bush , an enron director , wendy lee gramm , is the wife of texas senator phil gramm , top republican on the senate banking committee . and enron spreads its lobbying budget - - $ 2 . 13 million in 2000 - - across both parties . just this year it hired four lobbying firms with democratic roots . enron says it lobbies heavily because it operates in regulated industries . it notes that electric utilities outspend it 35 to 1 . on oct . 31 , a special committee of enron ' s board hired william r . mclucas , former sec enforcement director , to represent it . mclucas should know that any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire . pitt , who joined the sec out of law school in 1968 , " remembers how the [ nixon - era ] sec tainted itself by turning a blind eye to [ fugitive financier ] robert vesco , " says an agency veteran . pitt has too much riding on the enron probe to let its connections sway his judgment . mcnamee covers finance in washington . afl - cio , amalgamated bank call on enron to redirect the mission of newly created special committee : outside directors must adopt independent role 11 / 02 / 2001 pr newswire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire ) washington , nov . 2 / prnewswire / - - in a shareholder letter sent today to the board of directors of the enron corporation ( nyse : ene ) , the afl - cio and the amalgamated bank called on enron to expand the mission of its newly created special committee and for enron ' s board to adopt a package of reforms designed to restore investor confidence in the battered energy firm . america ' s working families are significant shareholders of enron stock through their pension , health and welfare benefit funds . among other suggestions , the letter urges the board to expand the special committee ' s mandate to : * examine all transactions with entities in which enron employees or directors have an interest * adopt procedures for reviewing insider participation in investments * commence an extraordinary review of executive compensation * adopt a stricter definition of director independence and disclose director conflicts of interest " the special committee ' s mandate is far too narrow to address the current crisis , " said richard trumka , secretary - treasurer of the afl - cio . " in light of enron ' s recent balance sheet write - downs , share price decline , and credit rating deterioration , the special committee must be forward looking and consider sweeping governance reform measures , " he explained . " in this time of crisis , outside directors must reform enron ' s traditional lack of transparency and communicate directly with shareholders , " said gabriel caprio , president and ceo of the amalgamated bank . " this is particularly important since several outside directors have apparent conflicts of interest that compromise their objectivity , " he added . afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds with over $ 400 billion in assets and hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares . the afl - cio is joined in its call for reform by the amalgamated bank , the trustee of the longview funds which hold 251 , 304 shares of enron . the amalgamated bank ' s longview funds are collective investment trusts that manage equity assets on behalf of workers ' benefit funds . a copy of the letter sent to enron ' s board of directors is available by contacting the afl - cio office of investment at 202 - 637 - 3900 or online at http : / / www . shareholdervalue . org . make your opinion count - click here / contact : lane windham , + 1 - 202 - 637 - 5018 , or bill patterson , + 1 - 202 - 637 - 3900 , both of afl - cio / 13 : 39 est copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . williams ceo sees validation of co ' s bandwidth model 11 / 02 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) houston - ( dow jones ) - at the beginning of the year , two telecommunications units born of energy companies seemed to symbolize the different ways to sell bandwidth . enron corp . ( ene ) was viewed as the hot pioneer blazing a trail for selling telecommunications network capacity as a commodity like natural gas or electricity . on the other hand , williams communications group ( wcg ) seemed to promote the old - fashioned method that telecommunications companies have used for making long - term agreements . on thursday , wcg reported third - quarter earnings of $ 22 . 6 million before taxes and interest . wcg chairman and chief executive howard janzen told dow jones newswires that the earnings validated williams ' model of a bandwidth company being a provider of services , not a trader of commodities . " i think bandwidth trading has its place , " janzen said . " it ' s developing relatively slowly . the reality is ( that ) bandwidth is not a commodity except for lower - capacity services and on certain routes with large amounts of capacity . " enron reported an $ 80 million third - quarter loss for its broadband services unit . as janzen views it , bandwidth is defined by the technology used to provide it . " the bandwidth we ' ll sell five years from now will be different from what we ' re selling today because of changes in technology , " he said . after taxes and interest , williams reported a loss of $ 272 . 7 million on revenue of $ 297 . 8 million in the third quarter . an extraordinary gain of $ 223 . 7 million from the repurchase of senior redeemable notes in the open market enabled williams to post the positive result before taxes and interest . in the same period a year ago , williams reported a net loss of $ 150 . 5 million on revenue of $ 209 million . williams also announced thursday that it has agreed to buy the assets of coreexpress , a company which operated on williams ' network . coreexpress guarantees data delivery over multiple networks and developed software to monitor quality of service over multiple networks . terms of the agreement weren ' t disclosed . the deal won ' t close until undisclosed conditions are met . williams also announced a 20 - year agreement valued at $ 267 million to provide bandwidth to boeing co . - by erwin seba , dow jones newswires , 713 - 547 - 9214 erwin . seba @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron shares plunge after s & p credit rating cut . 11 / 02 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . dropped more than 8 percent in early trade on friday , as the stock took a new plunge in a two - week free - fall , a day after its credit rating was cut for the second time this week . enron was down 89 cents , or 7 . 4 percent , to $ 11 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after briefly slipping to $ 10 . 95 , a price it also touched briefly on tuesday and last closed at in july 1992 . enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , lined up $ 1 billion of new credit on thursday in a bid to restore investor confidence . even so , standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating after stock markets closed on thursday , saying it could do so again if the situation worsens . enron has been rocked by a stock slide that has slashed two - thirds of its share price since oct . 16 , when the company reported a $ 1 billion charge that was caused , in part , by dealings linked to a chief financial officer who was subsequently ousted . houston - based enron is facing an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission into those dealings . at issue are off - balance sheet deals with limited partnerships , run by then - cfo andrew fastow , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns 2001 - 11 - 02 11 : 22 ( new york ) goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns new york , nov . 2 ( bloomberg ) - - goldman sachs group inc . refused to participate in a $ 1 billion loan to enron corp . because it was unwilling to risk its capital on a client with falling credit ratings that has been using its investment - banking services less often , according to people familiar with matter . enron chief executive kenneth lay asked for the line of credit after meeting with bankers from goldman , j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . last month to discuss ways to alleviate a cash crunch . j . p . morgan and citigroup agreed to lend on the condition that the houston - based energy trader pledge two pipelines as collateral . goldman ' s refusal highlights its reluctance to provide credit lines to all but its top fee - paying clients . by not lending to enron , the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buy enron or some of its assets , or make a bid of its own . for enron , the decision makes it harder to resist the demands of its existing lenders , who made the company give up collateral and pay higher interest rates to get its new loan . ` ` people smell resistance to enron , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an analyst with creditsights . com , an independent research firm . ` ` the balance of power is the with the banks now .

( ene ) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game . this is the home run enron must come up with : full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet , and proof the corporation can cover the difference . it ' s what stockholders , bondholders and trading partners have been demanding , but time is running out , and enron hasn ' t produced . " we ' re going to get to that number soon and tell people . we have to do that , " said a source at enron , who didn ' t know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited . " in this environment , we are going to be absolutely sure that it ' s accurate . " enron has about $ 3 . 3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003 . the company will sell the assets in those partnerships and , in a worse case scenario , will face a $ 1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets , enron has said . the company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock , shares will be trading closer to $ 20 than their current $ 11 . investors , however , aren ' t acting as if they ' re reassured . part of the trouble , analysts with credit - rating firm standard & poor ' s said friday morning , is that until enron sells the assets , nobody knows for sure what they ' re worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole . s & p is confident that enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole , provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company . credit derivative fizzle to see the pickle the world ' s premier energy franchise is in , one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk . that relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely , but the desk hasn ' t been able to transact for three weeks , since the value of enron ' s stock and bonds began to plummet , according to another enron employee . enron didn ' t respond to a request for comment , but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are " constrained " as the market continues to evaluate the company ' s credit position . until recently , customers would buy a credit derivative from enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company . a big supplier to a financially troubled company like xerox corp . ( xrx ) or lucent technologies ( lu ) , for example , might pay enron $ 1 million a year for a payout of , say , $ 10 million in the event of a bankruptcy . but you wouldn ' t pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims . likewise , with enron ' s creditworthiness in doubt , there ' s no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange lucent risk for enron risk . the same holds true , though less obviously , for enron ' s core business of energy trading . some utilities , large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $ 3 per million british thermal units - shoot to $ 10 this winter as they did last winter . to guard against that risk , companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices . if a company wants to lock in winter gas at $ 3 , should it turn to enron ? if gas were to rise to $ 10 in january and enron couldn ' t deliver , enron ' s counterparty paid a good price for no protection . and if enron failed in a $ 10 gas market , that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies . gas could go to $ 20 in a heartbeat . leading role an asset enron does have a man on base . the company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want enron to survive . and any company that moves to lock enron out of the market now could regret doing so if enron survives as the big dog . enron ' s trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point : they are continuing to trade with enron , but are avoiding long - term deals that increase their exposure to the company . the only acceptable long - term deals are those that offset deals done earlier . unless and until a bill goes unpaid , they ' ll keep delivering . enron , like the rest of the u . s . energy industry , paid its bills for september gas deliveries on oct . 20 and for its september electricity deliveries on oct . 25 . its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of november . that means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before enron ' s creditworthiness faces another test . in exchange for taking on that small risk , they keep the great market maker in business . lenders show concerns lenders , whether through holding enron bonds or providing loans , don ' t have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash . lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time , usually years . outside of long - term commitments , what worries the banks , which presumably got a good look at enron ' s books ? if enron is now unable to make the big bets with long - term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years , can it service all of its liabilities , known and unknown ? if it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants , or otherwise put those assets at risk , will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs ? what happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere ? if enron is to have a chance , it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt . so far this year , trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $ 2 . 2 billion out of $ 2 . 4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes . by comparison , enron has made $ 617 million in interest payments so far this year . j . p . morgan chase 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron says it remains ' biggest ' player in eu gas , power 11 / 02 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) london - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ( ene ) said in a statement friday that it remains the " the biggest buyer and seller of gas and power in europe , " and that its enrononline platform " continues to be the key trading platform in europe . " the company issued the statement in response to widespread rumors that several companies have ceased trading gas and power with enron since its share price took a nosedive last week . in the statement , enron added that worldwide transactions in the power and gas markets were averaging $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day , up from a 30 - day average of $ 2 . 5 billion at close of business friday , oct . 26 . enron has been on the defensive after announcing a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million two weeks ago , followed by news that it took a $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down , based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers . on wednesday , enron disclosed that the sec elevated its inquiry into enron ' s alleged related - party transactions to a formal probe . enron corp . secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines this week , but the deal did not appease credit - rating agency standard + 44 - ( 0 ) 20 - 7842 - 9345 ; sarah . spikes @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 1 - enron shares fall as investor concerns linger . by janet mcgurty 11 / 02 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares in enron corp . , the u . s . energy trading giant facing a federal probe into its dealings , declined on friday amid lingering investor concern about management credibility and the outcome of pending lawsuits . shares of enron were off 62 cents , or 5 . 2 percent , at $ 11 . 37 in early afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , recouping some losses after plunging briefly to $ 10 . 95 , a closing price last seen in july 1992 and touched in intraday trade on tuesday . enron debt due in 2006 declined about another 6 points , and was trading at about 65 cents on the dollar . the bonds were trading at about $ 1 . 01 two weeks ago , before enron announced on oct . 16 a $ 1 billion charge , caused in part by dealings linked to partnerships run until recently by a chief financial officer who was ousted last week , and that form part of the federal probe . " there remain several fundamental issues that we believe need to be addressed before the clouds can clear above enron ' s skies , " said ronald barone of brokerage ubs warburg . apart from the probe by the securities and exchange commission , barone said concerns include " the evolving state of the company ' s balance sheet , management credibility and ultimate outcome of shareholder lawsuits . " a handful of law firms have sued enron , saying it overstated operating results , failed to write down assets on a timely basis and concealed investments that might require the company to issue large amounts of shares to cover loses . enron ' s woes have put it under intense investor scrutiny , with the company losing about $ 17 billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks . the afl - cio union umbrella urged enron on friday to review executive compensation and adopt procedures for insider investments , among other recommendations . afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds that hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares . premium player in risk management shares also plunged on friday - they have fallen about two - thirds in the past two weeks - after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating late thursday , the second cut this week . although s & p said another rate cut could ensue if enron ' s situation worsens , a team of s & p analysts told investors on a conference call on friday they were confident they were aware of all the company ' s financial obligations . enron has been criticized for providing scant details about its dealings , leading to concerns about the riskiness of its obligations . " enron is a premium player in the risk management area , " said ronald barone , a member of the s & p team who is not related to ubs ' s barone . the s & p analysts said they were using about $ 1 . 5 billion as the amount of off - balance sheet items , about half the $ 3 billion calculated in past years , because of a change in reporting international energy assets , which no longer puts non - recourse debt onto the balance sheet in places like india and south america . the s & p analysts also said they felt enron ' s move to secure a $ 1 billion line of additional credit earlier this week sent out enron ' s clear commitment to credit quality . they also said it seemed reasonable to expect a long - term solution to fix enron ' s hard to understand balance sheet would assume an infusion of long - term equity as well as asset sales . the s & p ratings team also said it was closely monitoring enron ' s trading partners for a change in their credit stance toward enron and , to date , have seen no significant change . but they cautioned that could change at any time and that was the reason for putting enron on the credit watch listing . enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay , who has been criticized for not providing the public enough details on enron , was a no - show at a business conference in houston where he had been scheduled to speak on friday morning . enron executive robert bradley , who declined to respond to questions from reuters after his speech , said he had been sent to replace lay because " ken is better at putting out fires at enron .

( three million five hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) with a bank in europe . presently , this money is still with the bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if i can not come over . presently , i ' m in a hospital in kenya where i have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer . i have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that i have only a few weeks to live . it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in the world . because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness , i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them . please , i beg you in the name of god to help me stand and collect the funds from the bank . i want a person that is god fearing that will use this money to fund churches , orphanages and widows propagating the word of god and to ensure that the house of god is maintained . the bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth . i took this decision because i don ' t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not christians and i don ' t want my husband ' s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers . i don ' t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner . hence the reason for taking this bold decision . i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace . i don ' t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband ' s relatives around me always . i don ' t want them to know about this development . with god all things are possible . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of attorney who is in europe as he will be the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds . please send all emails to : project 4 dneedy @ yahoo . co . in yours in christ , melissa pointer .

( ie - confirm that you are requesting hourly non - firm on the dc intertie s / n if that is what you intend to reserve . ) thus far , we have avoided these $ 12 , 000 . 00 charges by splitting some other costs with bpa . let ' s just be careful in the future so that we don ' t get hit big . please let me know if you have any questions . thanks , virginia

2	Subject: devil ' s tower update louise , i spoke with tom byargeon this morning while he was at the offshore technical conference . he has spoken with rick fowler , dominion , and plans on visiting him in new orleans next week . the highlights from the conversations are as follows : ? by the end of this week or next , he will have information on two more total depth wells that have been drilled . based on the rumor mill , the reserves associated with the devil ' s tower acreage are looking even more promising . however , nothing is definite until all data is received . ? based on the well data , rick has three financing options : ? negotiate exclusively with a company like enron ? synthetic lease financing with a commercial bank ? rebid ? since dominion is now 80 % owner in devil ' s tower ( bought out mariner ' s 20 % ) , the credit profile of the project looks better . ( pioneer is the other 20 % . ) rick realizes his mistake going with a company that has no equity backing and has egg on his face with upper management . my concern is that based on his experience , he will take the easy way out and align himself with a commercial bank . ? enron has the following in their favor : ? convergent and enron ' s bid were very similar except convergent had aker . ( dominion wanted a guarantee of an aker spar . ) tom has spoken with bob o ' sullivan from aker and he is interested in aligning himself with enron . as such , we can bring aker back to the table . ? dominion wants to spend dollars on " steel " for the project by the end of june . as such , dominion will have to make a decision quickly because it will affect whether devil ' s tower becomes an on - balance or off - balance sheet transaction . i think that dominion would prefer an off balance sheet deal . ? dominion won ' t rebid because the other counterparties were not competitive relative to enron or convergent . so , i think our true competition is against a commercial bank for synthetic lease financing . either way , we will have an answer quickly and since the gossip on convergent is out , i think it will stregthen our position on other spar bids ( ie . , medusa ) . regards , mrha

" the market is really shrugging off this news , " said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front " looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , " mr . kroll said . " i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . " although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . " the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , " said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be " difficult . " companies " are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , " said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as " double witching . " one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ?

analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally a " port status report " describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day forecast for uk trading . 1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston . 1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes to traders . weekly : produce a weather article for " critical mass " - internal trading newsletter . of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast . 2 ) requested projects : * gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective output from as many forecast models as we can get . * weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about creating a tradeable " nao index " and developing an in - house model for forecasting nao . * continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for power generation and hydro . * gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow . * the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data across spain for temperature and precipitation . 3 ) leads to follow up on : * elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let them know once we were up and running . * contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support for crude and products . * follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power 4 ) challenges : * we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office functions on a " hot desk " system where people are constantly moving around . this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very difficult for our customers to identify us . * administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually preparing the reports ! - - - mike , ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project . hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and vince tomorrow .

2	Subject: from george williams from george williams abidjan . phone ; 00 225 05 28 23 44 dear , seasonal greetings to you . i know that this mail will come to you as a surprise please it was borne out of genuine search for assistance . my name is george williams the only child of late dr . vincent kone william the former personal assistance to the deposed liberian head of state mr . charles taylor who is now in exile . iam 21 years old . i got your address from the ecowas information centre here in abidjan the economic capital of cote d ' ivoire . my source of your contact gave me the confidence to confide in you . please iam seeking your assistance to help me claim and transfer to your account the sum of eleven million five hundred thousand dollars . ( $ 11 . 500 , 000 . 00 , ) deposited by my late father with a bank here here in abidjan cote d ` ivoire before his death to your country for onward investment in any lucrative business you may deem fit in your country . and work towards my coming over to your country . source of the money ; my late father may his soul rest in perfect peace , was during the period of the civil war in sierra - leone the personal assistant to the then head of state in my country liberia mr . charles taylor . when he was about to die in 2002 he called me and my mother to his hospital bed and told us that he was poisoned by some of his collegeus in the government house who does not like his close relationship with the president . he then told us that if he eventually dies which latter happened that we should leave the country for cote d ' ivoire in other to savegurd our lives . he also disclosed to us about the money he deposited with the bank and handed over the documents of the deposit to mum to keep for me . he said that the money was made by him through the many business transactions on diamonds he made on behalf of the president mr . taylor with the sierra - leonian rebels during the civil war over there . the rebels where supplied arms in return for diamonds . my father told us that due to his position in government and the fact that i am still young then he made an agreement with the bank that in case of his death that the money should be transfered to his foreign business partner ` s account though he did not submit the name of the partner to the bank . he also told us that my name was registered as the benificiary and next to kin that i could only have only have access to the money until iam 25 years . so the only person who can have access to the account now since iam not upto 25 years is the foreign business partner . so my father before he gave up the ghost advised my mum to assist me and search for a good person who could help us transfer the money to his or her account so that we could submit the person ` s name to the bank as his foreign business partner . after my fathers death , i and my mother was helped to escape to cote d ' ivore ` by an old aquitance of my father because of the civilwar which was on in my country by that time . on getting to abidjan my mother developed a terminal illness which eventully claimed her live . now iam staying in an assylum camp here in abidjan like an orphan . and my only hope for survival in this world now is this money my late dad deposited with the with the bank here . as my mother handed over to me before her death , the whole documents given to her by my late father to safe keep for me . i have located the bank and met the director who agreed to my explanations . but he said that i cannot make the withdrawal of the of the money because it has to be transfered to my father ' s foreign business partner ` s account as it was in the agreement reached by the bank and my late father . in that regard iam seeking your help with the believe that i could trust you , i wish to present your name as my father ' s foreign business partner so that you can help me to transfer the money to your account . and facilitate my coming over to your country for onward investement of the money . all the document relating to the transaction will be sent to you on request . i have decided to give 15 % of the money to you if could help me transfer the fund while 5 % will be set aside for any expenditure incured during the transaction . please if you are interested in helping me , reply this message as soon as possible or contact me with the above written phone number ; + 225 05 28 23 44 so that i will give you directives on what to do next . i eagerly awaits your reply which ihope will be positive . yours sincerely , george williams you can click on the links below to comfirm my story .

2	Subject: eeos louise , i have completed a review our current requirements for services from eeos as well as those for 2002 . at present , we are using bill fox to support the coal initiative . in addition , we are using ed danhaus for city of austin warranty work . all work by eeos to support the site acquisition and development initiatives including ft pierce have been terminated or are being terminated . matt tezyk has just completed an inventory of the westinghouse equipment ( d 5 a ) that we own that is currently in dispute . while we are not currently using eeos for vitro , tractebel has a call on named eeos personnel at the project budget through november of 02 . we have an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to subsititute others if these individuals are not available . all these requirements as well as any others can be met from virgo ' s group in 2002 . therefore , we have no requirements from eeos in 2002 . neither west power nor canada are currently using eeos . the longview project is in the pre - ntp phase . a buyer could elect to use eeos as the turnkey contractor but would not be obligated to use them nor would we be obligated to offer eeos services in the sale . they do not anticipate using eeos in 2002 . likewise , canada will not use them in 2002 . enron sa is currently using 1 - 2 engineers from eeos on a full time basis . this requirement could increase ( slightly ) in 2002 if they phase out their inernal group . however they would also be comfortable using third party vendors in sa . thus , they do not require eeos .

2	Subject: personal contact dear sir / madam , you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker . before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland . the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father . it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice . i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end . you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction . thank for your anticipated co - operations . peter stevens .

" , i have to blush & say . . . persistence and personality . of course , i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret . clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable . it ' s not years of digging to find the " secrets " to internet riches . one thing that " gets to me " so often in my work as an internet consultant , author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net . it ' s almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture , that " success " is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall . it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! ! long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking the bank . get it ! ! http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb . but , the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success . and , yes , rick & i come from the same school of " self marketing " - marketing you ! obviously , that ' s the core of his excellent new ebook , and i couldn ' t agree with him more . point being , * you * are everything you do online to succeed . you are your web site , your business , your marketing piece , your customer service , your customers ' experiences with your business - - all of it , is you ! read his ebook & you ' ll see more of what i ' m saying . the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see , blocking the path between you & internet success . listen to me - it is not real ok ? it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! ! what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself . when you realize this , you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * , which is the only " real " place it ever was anyhow ! yes , " persistence and personality " inherently includes honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable , powerful key to your success . . . is you ! that may be the most incredible " secret " we ever uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it . talk about simple ! ! bryan is a " veteran " internet consultant , author , internet success strategist & marketer . he publishes mega - success . com chronicles to over 11 , 500 subscribing members , authors articles which appear all over the net , and helps hundreds of wealth - hungry people in their journey to internet success . bryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet marketing group at http : / / . com & a fantastic new joint venture partners program for that site . bryan hall is a founding member and the development consultant for the prestigious icop ( tm ) at http : / / www . i - cop . org / 1016 . htm you can reach bryan at 877 . 230 . 3267 or by emailing him directly at bryan . hall @ mega - success . com  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  member showcase  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  examine carefully - those with email addresses included will trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them . there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at these successful sites programs other members are involved in . . . get insane amounts of traffic to your website . purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic  more money ! less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited . order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com trade links - businessopps @ aol . com stop smoking - free lesson ! ! discover the secret to stopping smoking . to master these powerful techniques , come to http : / / www . breath - of - life . net for your free lesson . act now ! p . s . tell someone you care about . trade links - jturco 3 @ hotmail . com celebration sale ! $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores , gift stores , adult sites toy stores . mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price . order now ! http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?

2	Subject: re : gas nom ' s we ' ve talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach : remind brazos that under exhibit 7 . 12 , page 2 of the ppa , brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant ' s mdq ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request . the partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first , gas for resale second . if brazos ' electric nominations by hour would , given ambient conditions , cause us to use at or above the plant ' s mdq under its contracts with apache / williams ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) , gas nominations will be zero . this needs to be handled between the operators . i ' ve emphasized " at or above " on purpose ; if an all electric nomination would cause brazos to burn in excess of 45 , 000 dth per day , we will honor that request ( we ' re looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past , as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss ) . after being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment , brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires ( provided they ' re still capped at 45 , 000 dth / d if they take gas ) . whenever they go this route , however , we need to hold them to the electric nomination ( i . e . , they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount ) . remind brazos that under the ppa , they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they ' ve elected to take gas . if the issue of precedent comes up , remind them that we ' re operating in a new territory and that electric - gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months ; it wasn ' t until recently that we ' ve been able to attribute imbalance penalties to brazos , which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely . as a show of good faith , we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed / nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations . hope this helps to clarify where we are . rh - - - - - original message - - - - - from : " ken riesz " @ enron [ mailto : imceanotes - + 22 ken + 20 riesz + 22 + 20 + 3 cken + 2 eriesz + 40 naes + 2 ecom + 3 e + 40 enron @ enron . com ] sent : friday , june 15 , 2001 4 : 27 pm to : mazowita , mike ; hill , garrick ; ward , charles subject : gas nom ' s chuck , i just wanted to make sure everyone has the same undertstanding of the gas nominations and usage issue . today with this most recent daily nomination revision from brazos , brazos ( waco ) now understands that we are going to hold them to 45 , 000 mbtu ' s when they are requesting electrical generation and gas energy . however , i want everone of us to understand that a nomination from brazos for a 6312 mwh , s ( 263 / hr ) , will require the plant to utilize 47 , 500 to 48 , 500 mbtu ' s at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy . to allow brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to be something less than 258 mw loading per hour . regards , ken

' s g / l ) . according to gas acct . , they will calculate ua for each of the profit centers ( 19 in total ) . as we discussed , vm does not have the appropriate unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie ua 4 out as we have in the past using our same reports - gas acct . will have to sum their side of the ua 4 calc . to match us . with the foresight of eventually going to profit center level accouting and reporting , there will need to be significant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower level of reporting . i believe the flash is already being done at the different profit centers , but all the downstream groups are still performing their analysis at a more consolidated level . there were discussions in the meeting that oa would not go to this lower level , but i am of the opinion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organization - so if this is the path we take , then everyone ' s process will need to be able to handle this level of detail . of course , no decisions were made in our meeting , and as i stated , for now , vm ' s process will remain unchanged for this month . please let me know if you want to discuss further . thanks !

2	Subject: bloomberg fees please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on bloomberg : 1 . bloomberg charges a $ 15 flat broker fee . 2 . this fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade . 3 . this fee applies each time you make a trade on bloomberg i . e . $ 15 per hit or lift , regardless of volume 4 . when you extend a bloomberg deal in deal entry , account for each separate trade accordingly by adding $ 15 to any existing broker fee . * * * * * * 5 . because this fee is flat , select the " flat " button to the right of the broker fee . * * * * * 6 . and most importantly , make a note in the " broker " box that the broker is in fact bloomberg . i know that many of you were never notified of the bloomberg fee structure , but going forward we should see every trade done on bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with bloomberg . the confirms group in houston has compiled a weighty list of " missing " hourly trades since the advent of real time bloomberg trading . i believe these are all in the system , but possibly short a broker name and fee . this , going forward , should no longer be a problem . please let me know if you have any questions regarding bloomberg trading and / or fees . thanks , kate

2	Subject: re : business offer dear sir , greetings , i am mr . henry okoye the account manager of mr . ziya bazhayev in standard trust bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development . the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev . you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / www . amarillonet . com / stories / 031500 / usn _ lao 703 . 001 . shtml and http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose . on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my family picture , to proof who i am . i await your urgent responce . regrads , mr . henry okoye

2	Subject: limit violation notification in the spirit of let us make it better - not in ted is chucking blame around , please consider the following issue : at the audit comittee meeting , jeff made the comment that the number of and timing of the limit notifications caused them to be meaningless . now part of that was an attempt by him to diffuse the number of notifications represented graphically , but i think that there is an element of truth , particularly of late . therefore , i propose that we work toward making that timing faster and the impact more meaningful . i think the following might help : 1 ) cassandra will be our point person , therefore it will be faster than waiting for the slower , more distracted and less organized me 2 ) i will propose that we raise the threshholds for notifications , particularly at jeff ' s level - i think that the sheer volume makes an impression on rick . unfortunately , i think that it will not be in effect until after the dec bd meeting . fyi i have proposed this at least twice and have been shot down by greg and rick , but now that a smart guy is proposing it , it will probably get more attention . 3 ) we should use the executive report viewer as the mechanism for delivery . i do not know who actually supports that thing so please let me know . it has been important to aa for audit purposes to see " evidence " that rick , jeff , ken and bd received appropriate notification - so that needs to be considered . another possibility would be risktrac . the 3 - d solution contracted for contains an " executive view " of " hot spots " . unfortunately , even though jeff requested it on his desk top 5 months ago , we can ' t get the it resources to pay attention to it . it however , has been interviewed several times for magazines and have created such incredibly successful and useful products such as energydesk . com , credit . com , en - lighten , . . conceptually , notifications should take place before trading begins the next day . this may be utopian , but it is fundamentally correct ( just because enron doesn ' t know it is supposed to , doesn ' t make it right ) . i am certain that real risk management organizations have a mechanism in place for this . it may be necessary to create a swag process that is lightning fast with a more exact process to follow . please have fixed by close of business today . ted

2	Subject: fw : bistineau louise , this is the email written by paul bienawski regarding a potential aquisition of bistineau . you had mentioned an interest in seeing this email last week . mrha - - - - - original message - - - - - from : bieniawski , paul sent : thursday , august 23 , 2001 9 : 54 pm to : miller , don ( asset mktg ) cc : mrha , jean ; gregory , paul subject : bistineau importance : high don , this is a long e - mail and i apologize for that but since we have not had a chance to talk , i wanted to send you some information on bistineau as well as the latest output from the storage group ' s m & a analysis . the m & a analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months ( aec @ manchester , atmos @ east diamond , and aquila @ lodi ) . prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition . i have attached the output for your review but i think a couple of points are key . the reservoir curve is " hockey - sticking " just as the salt curve did previously . while not as dramatic as salt , the premiums are increasing dramatically . the market is not placing a premium on optionality . salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir , yet on a deliverability basis , there does not appear to be a significant difference . that may explain why we see players who do value optionality in the marketplace ( aquila , aec , duke , etc ) . these companies have long established asset based storage groups and actively trade around these assets . as far as bistineau is concerned , there are several points worth highlighting . i have attached output from the database maintained by the storage group for your reference . i have not included caverns but we do have that data . reliant energy is part owner of the facility . reliant is aggressively trying to build a merchant storage business . my group has bumped into them several times in the marketplace . since the facility is federally regulated , reliant and koch would be required to make a nga 7 ( b ) filing to abandon the services they provide their customers before anyone could purchase the reservoir . the length of this process would be a function of the number of intervenors . bistineau is a very large reservoir with a large amount of native base gas . how much of this volume is recoverable ( and therefore monetizable ) is a large question mark . relative to its peers , bistineau is a poor performer in terms of flexibility ( low injection capabilities ) koch has , in the past , written off losses at bistineau . the low injection rate may be as a result of this . i have not researched the exact amount of the losses but a seach of ferc filings would reveal the nature and extent of the losses . epps likewise has had some loss problems . if enron ' s intent is to establish a storage asset position in louisiana , south downsville would probably be the best candidate . the field is privately held , under development , has many interconnects , and acquisition would probably meet little resistance given the lack of customers . while i have not communicated with matrix in some time , i do know the principals and could easily get an update on their status and plans . i will not be in tomorrow morning , but should you wish to discuss this e - mail , feel free to call me on my cell phone @ 713 - 825 - 2643 .

" the earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly , and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point , " said michael holland , who runs the $ 65 million holland balanced fund . focus not on earnings " the focus ( for investors ) has been and continues to be outside of earnings , that is , the war on terrorism specifically , " he said . dynegy inc . , a natural gas and power marketer and trader , on monday said third - quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns . while enron posted a loss , it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business . " energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down , " said jon burnham , portfolio manager for the $ 170 million burnham fund . " these are good , well - financed companies . " caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes . the peoria , illinois - based company on tuesday said its third - quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing . the company also said it expects fourth - quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year - ago quarter , with full - year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent . it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month ' s attacks for the expected shortfall , but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels . unisys on monday reported its third - quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high - end server computers and systems integration work . it said it would cut 3 , 000 jobs and slashed its fourth - quarter outlook . taking grim tidings in stride other companies that have reported profit drops include novellus systems inc . , a maker of semiconductor production equipment , and charles schwab corp . , the top u . s . discount brokerage . schwab said tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer , although a surge in september trading pointed to better times ahead . money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride .

" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , " chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview . earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years . future options for the broadband business include " sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities " he said . " we still think over time that it will be a valuable business , " lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a " total meltdown " , he added . enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters . enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations . enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 6 - enron posts loss after taking $ 1 bln in charges . by c . bryson hull 10 / 16 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , oct 16 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses . enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company . " what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , " chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call . lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm . houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 . the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago . " they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield , " said meade . enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period . ill - fated businesses originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity . the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled . enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets . enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential . enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 . debt on credit review rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent . the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 . all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year . the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility . the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations . in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) 2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york ) enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) ( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . ) houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion . the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million , or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion . investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news is out . ` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' ' said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' ' investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas - pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t confident enron was detailing all its problems . failed businesses the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the past four quarters . included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and international business machines corp . new power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies . the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be more specific . enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers . the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron said . enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than $ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill , lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' ' lay said . excluding losses minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier . shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 . ` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 . ` ridiculous investments ' at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses . enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water , from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million . in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier . revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million . ` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments . ' ' while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money . the company gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including coal , forest products and steel . ` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' ' hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and clear , and that the effort is there .

" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear some risks , " says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at the world bank in warsaw . " but eventually they have to generate some return . " enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . ' s energy sector liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord pool ' s largest - volume trader . enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction . just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its 1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795 million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s . yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company declines to compare development times in various countries . " i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , " says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron europe in london . " but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past , it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process and get to the starting point . " at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site , and the polish power industry ' s rules . the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna to enron in 1998 . enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt , gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a 20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat the town of nowa sarzyna . the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts . " they were betting on their good name , " says michael davies , a partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron poland ' s lenders . " they are pushing envelopes all the time . " that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 . says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon smith barney in london : " because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . . ( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . " mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna " allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name on it . " in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by 2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a 12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines . the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down . " the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really know the price of electricity , " says bengt wegemo , president of vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for 55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340 million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10 years . investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing . ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 . but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to poland ' s distribution network . further , the government says it must solve the competition problem posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize . the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice what outmoded plants charge . " we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will generate us a ( bigger ) profit , " mr . astramowicz says . another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission service . pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export electricity and coal to eu countries via germany . " this is great news , " mr . astramowicz says . " if this joint venture gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . " enron and others are pushing hard for that access . " as soon as the market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a decent profit , " mr . astramowicz says . folder name : enron in europe relevance score on scale of 100 : 78 to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

( otcbb : vnbl  - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth  opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information  systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it  continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition  of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking  sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and  individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and  patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification )  technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use  applications , the company has concluded that the need for application  support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the  framework which operates such technology . the company has identified  several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software ,  and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both  internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves  routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into  different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as  web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and  non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software  enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is  important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated  with customer service . management software will allow for real time  visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a  warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and  accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant  access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the  supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of  different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the  system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will  be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid  and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical  security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses  that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets  in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the " act " ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words " plan , " " confident that , " " believe , " " scheduled , " " expect , " or " intend to , " and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject  to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such  risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly  designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive  factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ 0 . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2004 ! ! please watch this one trade monday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions  or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

2	Subject: fort pierce project louise , as i am sure you are aware , our current plans on fort pierce include going back to fpua and being honest with them ( i . e . letting them know that the transaction as currently structured is not likely to proceed ) . the goal of our meeting with fpua is to be both fair and honest and to provide them with the opportunity to make the project more feasible by making economic concessions . one concern that i have heard is that fpua may incorrectly assume that our visit has little to do with the reason mentioned above and more to do with enron ' s recent troubles . because fpua is a municipal entity and this project has been closely followed by the media , this discussion is likely to make it into the newspapers and any conclusions reached by fpua may be announced for all the world to see . do you have any suggestions for how this situation should be handled ? should eric thode be consulted ? stuart 
2	Subject: hello from micheal ! ! ! . dear , good day ! ! . compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family ! ! ! . i know this letter will come to you surprisingly but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arriving unannouced and an adage ays ' ' ' ' originals are very hard to find but their echo sounds ouder ' ' ' ' . so , i decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty if ihave to entrust any amount of money under your custody . i am mr micheal bangura , the son of late mr thaimu bangura who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed during the civil war . knowing your country as being economical condusive for investment and your people as transperant and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise i write you . before my father death , he had the sum of twenty - three million united states dollars ( us $ 23 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war . this fund was supposed to be used for rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country before the outbreak of war . when the war broke out , the rebel leader demanded that this fund be given to him , my father insisted that the money was not in his possesion but he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund . meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about this fund , because my father always confide in me . i quickly made an rangemnt with a red cross rellief worker who used his official van to move this money to lungi airport in freetown , although he did not know the real content of the box . the fund was deposited as a family reasure with a safe relaible security company in dakar senegel where i was only given temporary asylum . i do not want to invest this money in senegel due to unfavourable economic climate and so close to my country . as a result , i still kept this money also for security reasons as the present administration is investigating the existence of such fund of which i denied knowledge of it , claiming that my father did not tell me about such money . the only assistance i need from you which i believe you would do for me are the following : 1 . assist me invest this money in your country 2 . assure me that you will not sit on my share when this fund gets to your country . you will have 15 % of the money for yourself as you guide me further to invest the remaining 80 % in any valueble business venture while 5 % is earmarked to cover expenses contingencies . most importantly , i will like to buy a personal house where i and my mother will reside . upon confirmation of your interest to help me as my foreign partner to invest this money , i will link you the details of this ransaction to be scheduled in your favo ur by the security company . while thanking you for your anticipated understanding and cooperation , i look forward to your urgent esponse . please note that this transaction is strictly confidential and must be treated with utmost secrecy . best regards , mr . micheal bangura . please you can contact me on this e - mail m _ bangura @ iwon . com

( i believe jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision , and as an economist , ken could give valuable insight into what ' s happening in the market . ) finally , i ' d welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker . i ' d very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1 . ) enron people admire ; and 2 . ) has undergone some difficult period in their company ' s history . jeff personally extended an invitation to steve ballmer from microsoft , but he is unable to attend . is there someone you think would be interesting ? i truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue . i look forward to your thoughts and ideas . terrie james senior director , public relations enron broadband services ( ph ) 713 . 853 . 7727 ( fax ) 713 . 646 . 3248 terrie . james @ enron . com
