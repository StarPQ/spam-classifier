2	Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01 executive summary ? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day " opt - out " clause in all long - term power contracts . ? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table : puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value ? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing utility . ? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some details : of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this summer some of the " long term contracts " are really only for three months none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot market ? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly announce a 10 % rate hike . ? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal . pg & e transmissions deal one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power contracts being negotiated have a one - day " opt - out " clause they can exercise unilaterally if a " comprehensive solution " has not been reached by the state and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now . pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the " electricity buyer of last resort . " current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings . but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then pg & e will be left holding the bag . thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is demanding a " comprehensive solution " that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of " get out of jail free " card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must " positively approve " any grid purchase by the state of california . the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit . " we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they think , " according to the leader of one main consumer groups . " we are going to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . " negotiators for davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative . remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution . on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads . ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 % above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done , anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase . ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood . ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will " make them whole " in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving . thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior political official told our source " just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they come up with something even more outrageous . " pg and some of these " long - term contracts " are actually only good for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market . davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires . that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour . ferc the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but they may be wrong . " the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what anyone says , " according to source close to the president . there are three possibilities : 1 ) ferc could " pocket veto " it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system . one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not be around long enough to have his say . " hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the ferc chairman position , " says one washington official . two other appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and one of them " could easily become chairman .

2	Subject: mg : russian prepayment exposure interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by tim - says a lot about the way mg do business i think . re ny we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( philip bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a dash for each prepayment on a contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in ny and we may have some issues - although marcelo and others stressed the fact that concentrates appeared to move no product without a letter of credit , which was then often discounted to realise cash ! ! shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment yesterday from philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were ' unique ' - whilst i can accept that each may be tailored to customer preferences - they still need to be cacsed - we should look at the enforceability / legal risk here . whilst information prepayment risk for metals should come from london - accessing any relevent inofrmation from ny may be helpful will call later ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 27 / 07 / 2000 09 : 33 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tim poullain - patterson 26 / 07 / 2000 21 : 53 to : eric gadd / lon / ect @ ect , goran novakovic / lon / ect @ ect , robert quick / lon / ect @ ect , david hardy / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , justin boyd / lon / ect @ ect , howard carter / the metal & commodity co ltd / mgltd @ mgltd cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect , diana higgins / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect , david p tregar / mgltd _ london / mgltd @ mgltd subject : mg : russian prepayment exposure the situation at present is as follows : mg have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper from the russian federation on a prepayment basis all contracts are on a floating price basis ( lme less discount ) notional value of each contract is circa $ 0 . 5 - 3 mm prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis , for between 90 - 95 % value with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents the issues break down into three broad areas : 1 ) commercial at present enron does not engage in prepayment activities with russian federation counterparties . no further prepayments are permitted until rac have performed a dash for this activity . as this is likely to take several weeks howard will liase with commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising from this suspension . howard and david hardy will also take immediate steps to manage down existing prepayment exposures . 2 ) legal based on a cursory review of the confirmations by robert , if we are to continue this activity legal need to instructed to perform a full review for several reasons , including : the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms , e . g . pricing date they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments , and are generally not constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity . " conditions of purchase " are attached to the confirmations which refer to english law , but as they are not always countersigned , under conflict rules the closest or real connection may be deemed to be russian law which , in the absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability . there are several " open " contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are beyond the delivery period , and which could be considered to have been discharged by breach . again the confirmation does not contain adequate language . 3 ) credit / operational there are no formal counterparty limits . nor are prepayment and volumetric exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis . this information is necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance , and needs to be factored into the overall credit monitoring process . david has requested this information from mg , and will follow up this one off exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track exposures based on the methodology developed for helsinki . further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that , despite the issues identified with contractual terms , there is performance against the contracts . david is pursuing this from a credit perspective and will report back to his group his findings by friday latest . the issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to accelerate a planned review of contract language for all mg ' s activities in all jurisdictions . mike and i will discuss bringing this review forward with justin . any questions , please call . regards , tim

( dyn ) terminated its troubled merger agreement with enron corp . ( ene ) , backing away from the deal despite frantic last - minute attempts by both sides to save it . dynegy wednesday cited enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , convenants and agreements , including the material adverse change provision . the announcement came after standard & poor ' s cut the beleaguered energy trader ' s debt rating to b - minus , essentially rendering it to junk status . the downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that enron will be forced to file for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code . that could be a fatal blow for enron , which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive . standard & poor ' s lowered its long - term rating on enron to b - minus from triple - b - minus , citing fears that dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase of enron . the collapse of the dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on enron ' s credit profile because of enron ' s limited access to capital at a time when extensive debt restructuring is necessary , s & p said . " while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this doesn ' t reflect a failure for the energy merchant business , " dynegy said in announcing its decision . however , dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are solid , and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of enron . in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down $ 2 . 91 , or 71 % , to $ 1 . 20 . dynegy , meanwhile , was down $ 4 . 08 , or 10 % , at $ 36 . 81 , also on the big board . top executives of enron and dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine the two energy - trading companies amid growing signs that enron faced cash - flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business . talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all - stock transaction after enron ' s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn ' t be as high as originally anticipated . last month dynegy agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation . citing a person familiar with the situation , the wall street journal said wednesday that enron ' s board late tuesday had informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered , down more than 50 % from the original offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share . that latest proposed share - exchange ratio valued enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , or a total of $ 4 . 17 billion . that would compare with the original value of $ 10 . 98 a share , or $ 9 . 33 billion . in exchange for reducing the purchase price , some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company . dynegy also was considering an additional $ 250 million cash investment in enron . dynegy , together with chevrontexaco inc . ( cvx ) , has already injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company . while struggling to keep the planned merger alive , enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings . enron has a total of about $ 13 billion of debt , of which about $ 9 billion comes due by the end of next year . last month enron said in a filing with the sec that a cut in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain levels - would trigger the need to repay , refinance or cash collateralize facilities totaling $ 3 . 9 billion . dynegy said wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of enron natural gas pipeline unit northern natural , omaha , neb . , and said it has exercised its right to acquire the unit ' s common shares . chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , contributed $ 1 . 5 billion to the proposed enron merger , and dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline unit . northern natural , which owns and operates 16 , 500 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline spanning from the permian basin of texas to the great lakes , has historically been a strong earnings contributor . dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to dynegy ' s own energy delivery network . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s fall to spark volatility on pwr , natural gas mkts 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 403 - 531 - 2912 dina . omeara @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . merger collapse , weak fed report , rattle investors at midafternoon by stacy forster 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) the wall street journal online blue - chip stocks remained weak wednesday , after a key survey of regional conditions from the federal reserve revealed that many sectors of the economy continued to struggle . investors also were rattled by news that dynegy had pulled out of merger talks with fellow energy - provider enron . in midafternoon trading , the dow jones industrial average was down 111 points to 9761 , after flirting with a return to 10000 over the last two sessions . the industrials finished down 110 . 15 points , or 1 . 1 % , at 9872 . 60 tuesday . meanwhile , the nasdaq composite index lost 27 . 30 to 1908 . 70 , after declining 5 . 26 points to 1935 . 97 tuesday . other indexes also fell . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index shed 13 . 20 to 1136 . 40 , the russell 2000 index declined 3 to 457 . 70 , and the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 4 . 90 to 579 . 70 . the fed ' s so - called beige book indicated the economy remained soft in october and november . the survey showed " signs of further slowing outweighed signs of recovery " in early november .

( ene ) will survive the company ' s troubles , but they won ' t emerge unscathed , traders and analysts said wednesday . energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the houston - based giant ' s creditworthiness , allowing a more or less orderly withdrawal of enron from the market before ratings agencies wednesday downgraded enron ' s credit to junk - bond levels . nevertheless , liquidity in the north american natural gas and electricity markets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tightened in general , creating difficulties for some energy traders . " this doesn ' t spell the end of energy trading , " said one trading manager for an independent power producer . " the market is much bigger than enron , and that ' s why enron fell . this does spell the spell the end of trading for companies that don ' t have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or two as credit requirements are generally tightened , " moreover , small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their 2002 output with enron earlier this year - when prices were much higher than they are now - will suffer if enron has trouble fulfilling those commitments . enron warned in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels . news of enron ' s downgrade added 5 cents to 10 cents to natural gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange , as traders covering short positions sent the december contract to $ 2 . 82 per million british thermal units , traders said . midwestern and southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due to trading inefficiencies after enron turned off its internet - based trading platform enrononline and higher gas prices . prices have in all those markets have since fallen , but the moves point to the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders expect should enron exit the market entirely . kyle cooper , energy analyst at salomon smith barney , said traders will have to present wider bid - offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets in which enron provided critical liquidity .

" on average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties , " enron ' s director of continental power trading gregor baeumerich told reuters in an interview last month , days before the group was plunged into its current crisis . britain ' s forward gas market rallied on wednesday as it emerged that a rescue deal from smaller rival dynegy had unravelled and enron looked to be skating dangerously close to bankruptcy . enron ' s list of trading partners included major utilities such as german giants e . on and rwe and the uk ' s innogy and british energy u . s . companies with trading desk in europe , such as txu , aep , dynegy and duke energy , also traded with enron . the company ' s enrononline internet trading platform , suspended earlier on wednesday , set the standard for online trading , offering a blueprint followed by utilities and brokers . enron did about 60 percent of its trade through the platform . the group ' s presence in europe is not confined to trading . the company has around 4 , 000 megawatts of power generation , spanning italy , poland , greece and the uk where it owns one of the biggest plants at teesside . the company built a reputation for hard - nosed trading expertise in europe ' s previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost evangelical . in the summer , flushed with confidence , the company placed a bmw sports car in the lobby of its london office , a prize for employees successful in recruiting fresh talent for the enron cause . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : wrapup 2 - enron near collapse after dynegy pulls out . by c . bryson hull 11 / 28 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . swooned at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . blew apart . dynegy accused enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeover agreement was negotiated on nov . 9 , invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the all - stock deal valued at $ 9 . 3 billion at the time . shares of enron , recently ranked no . 7 on the fortune 500 list of the biggest u . s . companies , had lost most of their value in the past three weeks , and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on enron ' s bonds to junk status by the time dynegy made its announcement . enron ' s latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free - fall that began innocently enough with the announcement of a $ 638 million quarterly loss six weeks ago . surprise disclosures , including the admission it overstated earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 and kept huge debts off its balance sheet , led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almost $ 80 billion a little more than a year ago . on wednesday , its market value was less than $ 500 million . in response to dynegy ' s announcements and credit rating downgrades , enron said it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations . kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said the company was evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesses . the loss of enron ' s investment - grade credit rating forces some $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to come due immediately , a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $ 5 . 5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat . enron said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to " continue as a going concern " were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status . it became increasingly clear , as dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal , that enron ' s tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a sticking point , sources close to the negotiations said . " while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement . dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline with the $ 1 . 5 billion it and partner chevrontexaco put into the deal . dynegy said it stopped trading with enron as of wednesday morning , pegging its exposure at $ 75 million . a bad sign came earlier on wednesday , as energy traders said operations had stopped at enron ' s once highly lucrative online trading system , enrononline . the unit accounted for up to 90 percent of enron ' s earnings , and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that dynegy coveted most in its planned $ 9 . 3 billion all - stock takeover . risk management failures enron , which touted itself as an agile risk manager , found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks . the partnerships , which included top enron executives and are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation , provided financing in exchange for guarantees that enron ' s stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment - grade . but they came back onto the balance sheet with a vengeance , as enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations as its shares and credit fell . enron shares plunged $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , to 61 cents on wednesday , as the new york stock exchange twice halted trading of enron shares before announcements affecting the company . it ' s stock has fallen more than 98 percent this year . the stock peaked at $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 , riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena . " they ( enron ) entrapped the sophisticates , " said robert stovall , senior strategist at prudential securities , referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors . " i think this is going to become a classic case . " stovall , with nearly 50 years of wall street experience , said he could not recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of enron . " you would have to go to pre - sec days for that , " he said , referring to the creation of the sec in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 . the final cuts standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch all cut their ratings on the fallen energy trading giant ' s debt to junk status . s & p said it had lost confidence in enron ' s ability to complete the merger with dynegy , and said bankruptcy was a " distinct possibility " if the merger fails . andre meade , a commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on enron and the deal , said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace in recent weeks , and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they wanted inside enron . " the numbers were not enough to soothe them , " said meade , who downgraded enron to " sell " from " hold " on wednesday . " this company should have been downgraded to junk weeks ago . the ratings agencies had given them several weeks , and they just couldn ' t hold out anymore . " dynegy on nov . 9 said it would take over enron in a deal valued at about $ 10 . 41 per enron share . chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , pledged to immediately pump $ 1 . 5 billion into enron to bolster its withering finances . deal advisers j . p . morgan chase and citigroup have already contributed $ 1 billion to the deal , and were expected to have to put up after enron was rebuffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash . representatives of dynegy and enron had haggled over new terms for the takeover late into tuesday , including a buyout offer half the original price , sources close to the talks said . enron ' s crash began when it said it would take $ 1 . 01 billion in writedowns and charges against its third - quarter earnings for failed investments . it later admitted that it had to reduce stockholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion to extract itself from partnerships in which now - ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow the managing partner . those deals , in which fastow earned about $ 30 million in management fees , are the subject of an sec investigation and the . worse yet for enron , it was required to restate its earnings going back four years , shaving off $ 600 million in the process .

" dynegy ' s customer - based , asset - backed energy delivery network has been the driver of our 45 percent compounded annual growth rate for the past 16 years and will continue to provide us with earnings sustainability and future growth . chevrontexaco , which owns 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common shares , had contributed $ 1 . 5 billion to dynegy as a participant in the transaction . dynegy used the $ 1 . 5 billion to purchase 100 percent of the preferred stock of enron subsidiary , northern natural gas pipeline ( nng ) . dynegy has exercised its option to purchase all the membership interests in the entity which indirectly owns all of the common stock of nng , subject to satisfaction of closing conditions . northern natural , headquartered in omaha , nebraska , owns and operates 16 , 500 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline spanning from the permian basin of texas to the great lakes . it has historically been a strong earnings contributor , and will be a positive addition to dynegy ' s energy delivery network , said the company . " the industry has reacted and adjusted well to the potential loss of a market participant over the past several weeks , " said dynegy president and chief operating officer steve bergstrom . " with our superior systems , technology infrastructure and people , dynegy and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy markets .

' ' bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors including saudi prince alwaleed bin talal , the blackstone group lp and the carlyle group inc . turned them down because of concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . that concern was heightened after enron disclosed a previously undisclosed $ 690 million interest payment due this week . dynegy said in a statement distributed by business wire that it terminated its agreement because enron breached covenants . chairman and ceo chuck watson said dynegy would invoke its right to purchase enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline . dynegy used an investment of $ 1 . 5 billion from chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one quarter of dynegy , to purchase the enron unit , which operates 16 , 500 miles of natural gas pipeline . enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls for comment . trading doubts enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . as a result , they either demanded more collateral to trade or restricting trading with the houston - based company . enrononline , enron corp . ' s online trading system , stopped allowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas late this morning , say traders who use the web site . enron said yesterday that enrononline handles about 60 percent of its trading business , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in trading on average over the last 30 days . ` ` we can log in , but there is nothing there , nothing to buy and nothing to sell , ' ' said juha laiho , an energy trader at finland - based fortum oyj in houston . ` ` it went down some time this morning . ' ' s in both 1998 and 1999 , it had been less than a majority . participants in the plan , which had $ 2 . 14 billion in assets available for benefits , could only do so much to diversify their investments . enron , like many other companies , used stock rather than cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of the shares . and they could only guess at the year - end makeup of the plan ' s assets until the end of june , reflecting sec disclosure standards for savings plans . by that time , the stock ' s drop - - which reached 99 percent today - - was already well under way . trio of lawsuits enron later reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter charges ; ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran partnerships that accounted for some of the charges ; restated its results since 1997 ; became the target of an sec accounting investigation ; and accepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc . , its biggest rival . the company ' s shares , which ended last year at $ 83 . 13 , fell as low as $ 1 . 05 today before a midday trading halt as enron ' s debt was downgraded to junk - bond status and dynegy abandoned its offer . in response to the plunge , employees in the 401 ( k ) plan - - which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax - free savings , and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue service code - - have filed three lawsuits against enron . the suits allege , among other things , that the houston - based company prevented employees from shifting investments within the plan between oct . 17 , the day after its disclosure of the charges , and nov . 19 as the company made administrative changes . all three seek class - action status on behalf of the plan ' s participants . the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener law firm , based in washington , on monday . it covers the longest time period : november 1995 to now . falling percentages enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan ' s assets at the end of 1994 , the year before the period associated with the gottesdiner suit began . the figure reflected a one - time company contribution of preferred stock , and rose from 62 percent in 1993 . each preferred share has a face value of $ 100 and is convertible into 27 . 304 common shares . this translates into a conversion price of $ 3 . 66 a share , which was a bargain before today ' s trading . the plan also owned a stake in enron ' s former oil and gas unit , which became eog resources inc . after gaining independence in 1999 . add in those shares , and company stock represented about two - thirds of the 1994 assets . enron ' s common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of 401 ( k ) assets available for benefits in 1995 , 58 percent in 1996 and 53 percent in 1997 as the u . s . stock market rallied , lifting the value of participants ' investments in equity mutual funds . the shares represented 49 percent of the plan ' s assets in 1998 . the proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999 , when the assets more than doubled - - exceeding the 56 percent increase in enron ' s share price that year - - to $ 1 . 62 billion . how much choice ? then came last year , when the common shares recorded their best performance in more than two decades even as u . s . stocks stumbled . enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and natural gas prices , while the standard & poor ' s 500 index , a market benchmark that includes the company , fell 10 percent . company shares in the plan rose in value by $ 652 . 7 million , according to an sec filing . the total includes shares bought and sold throughout the year . by contrast , mutual - fund holdings fell by $ 47 million and ` ` other investments ' ' rose by just $ 134 , 000 , the filing said . at year - end , the 401 ( k ) plan owned 13 . 9 million enron common shares and 70 , 000 preferred shares , valued at $ 1 . 32 billion . this total encompasses not only enron ' s matching contributions to the plan , but also employees ' investments with their own money . the company generally provides a 50 percent match , in stock , for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan . employees can ' t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment choices until they reach the age of 50 . company contributions accounted for about 11 percent of the plan ' s stock holdings , said karen denne , an enron spokeswoman . the figure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company than usual for 401 ( k ) participants . waiting for data for the average u . s . plan account , company stock amounted to 19 percent of assets at the end of last year , according to a study done by the employee benefit research institute and the investment company institute and published last week . in any case , enron ' s approach to matching ensures that as much as one - third of the contribution to an employee ' s account takes the form of shares that they can ' t sell right away . anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach , and enron ' s stock performance , affected the plan ' s financial position last year had to wait until june 27 . that ' s when the filing cited earlier arrived at the sec . employee savings and stock - purchase plans , such as 401 ( k ) plans , don ' t have to submit annual reports until 180 days after their fiscal year ends . they can even get a 15 - day extension of the deadline if they need one . by the time enron ' s plan made its annual report , it was already a bit too late to act on the information . the company ' s shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of the submission . as the filing demonstrated , employees looking to save for retirement had been set up for a fall . enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 ) 2001 - 11 - 28 14 : 38 ( new york ) enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 ) ( updates with analyst comment in third paragraph , fitch rating in fourth paragraph and shares in sixth paragraph . ) new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch , inc . slashed enron corp . ' s credit rating to junk status as rival energy trader dynegy inc . rescinded its buyout bid for the company . the cut could force enron into bankruptcy . at least $ 3 . 9 billion in debt comes due immediately because of the rating cut , and the company struggles with a cash crunch as it suspends its online trading unit and some ` ` non - core ' ' payments . enron ' s trading business is also faltering as trading partners lose faith in the company ' s ability to meet its obligations . ` ` this is a disaster , ' ' said jon kyle cartwright , a debt analyst at raymond james and associates . ` ` it is difficult , if not impossible , for anyone to do trades with enron ' s trading operations in light of junk ratings across the board and dynegy walking away from the deal . ' ' s & p reduced enron ' s long - term grade six levels to ` ` b - ' ' from ` ` bbb - ' ' and withdrew its ` ` a ' ' short - term rating . moody ' s cut enron ' s credit rating to ` ` b 2 , ' ' five levels below investment grade , from ` ` baa 3 , ' ' the lowest investment level . moody ' s affirmed its ` ` not - prime ' ' rating on enron ' s commercial paper . fitch cut enron ' s senior unsecured rating 10 levels , to ` ` cc ' ' from ` ` bbb - , ' ' and its short term rating to its second - lowest ` ` c ' ' from ` ` f 3 . ' ' fitch said a ` ` default of some kind appears probable . ' ' deterioration ` ` we saw the deterioration in the trading operations , and that threw the merger in doubt , ' ' said s & p analyst todd shipman and the author of the report . enron has $ 15 . 5 billion of debt outstanding , according to bloomberg data . its shares , which have fallen 99 . 2 percent so far this year , lost $ 3 . 34 cents today and are now trading at 77 cents . enron ' s stock had fallen by more than 50 percent since nov . 19 amid growing skepticism that the dynegy would complete the acquisition . ` ` we became a lot more concerned when the stock didn ' t stabilize , ' ' said john diaz , moody ' s managing director for energy and one of the authors of the report . ` ` the drop in the stock price put pressure on dynegy to renegotiate the deal . ' ' cash burn shipman said in his report that ` ` the willingness of dynegy to complete its planned acquisition of enron has been compromised by the continued drop in confidence in the capital markets that the transaction would hold . ' ' credit analysts also focused on enron ' s ` ` cash burn ' ' rate , diaz said . enron said in its most recent filing last week that it had $ 1 billion in cash , which was a lot less than the market had expected , diaz said . ` ` it came as a surprise to us and to others , ' ' he said . ` ` we expected at least $ 2 . 5 billion so they would have staying power . ' ' enron expected to sell portland utility to northwest natural 2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 07 ( new york ) enron expected to sell portland utility to northwest natural portland , oregon , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the nearly bankrupt energy trader , is expected to go through with the sale of its portland general electric co . unit to northwest natural gas co . , a spokesman for the utility owner said . enron last month agreed to sell pge to northwest natural for $ 2 . 9 billion in cash , stock and assumed debt . dynegy inc . today called off its planned purchase of enron , saying the energy trader breached covenants in the merger agreement . dynegy had supported the pge sale . northwest natural filed its application to buy pge with the oregon public utility commission today . enron representatives have given the portland , oregon - based company no indication that they plan to call off the sale , northwest natural spokesman steve sechrist said . ` ` we think the transaction will be completed , ' ' sechrist said . ` ` whatever happens to enron , the deal has significant benefits for customers and shareholders of both their company and our company . ' ' a spokeswoman for houston - based enron didn ' t return calls for comment . pge spokesman scott simms said he couldn ' t comment on enron ' s planned sale of the utility . northwest natural shares fell 32 cents to $ 24 . 02 in midafternoon trading . enron shares fell $ 2 . 91 to $ 1 . 20 before trading was halted for dynegy ' s announcement . enron shares have dropped 99 percent since the first of the year . commission ' s role marc hellman , the administrator responsible for mergers and acquisitions at the oregon public utility commission , said he is unsure what would happen if enron were to file for bankruptcy protection . ` ` i can ' t recall it ever happening , and i ' ve been here for 22 years , ' ' hellman said . ` ` if it went all the way to the end , where they ' re liquidating assets , you can ' t sell utility property without commission approval . there are probably some issues where our attorney general ' s office may look into it . ' ' hellman said he has heard nothing to indicate northwest natural ' s purchase of pge wouldn ' t go forward . ` ` enron was getting cash from northwest natural for the purchase , as well as shares , ' ' hellman said . ` ` that aspect of the transaction becomes a little curious if enron is going through bankruptcy . ' ' debt downgrades moody ' s investors service today downgraded pge ' s senior secured debt to a 3 from a 2 . moody ' s also downgraded pge ' s unsecured debt , its junior subordinated debt and its preferred stock . the ratings service said it had expected to downgrade pge ' s ratings once northwest natural completed its acquisition of the utility . ` ` however , today ' s rating action is being taken in advance of the expected closing of that transaction to reflect moody ' s concerns surrounding portland general ' s ability to remain fully insulated from the many financial challenges currently being faced by its parent , enron corp . , due in large part to lost investor confidence in enron , ' ' moody ' s said in a statement . sempra energy interested in buying some enron assets ( update 2 ) 2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 39 ( new york ) sempra energy interested in buying some enron assets ( update 2 ) ( adds enron comment in sixth paragraph , updates shares in fourth . ) san diego , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - sempra energy , an owner of electric and natural - gas utilities , is interested in buying some of enron corp . ' s assets now that the energy trader ' s planned merger with dynegy inc . has failed , a sempra spokesman said . ` ` we are interested in some of enron ' s hard assets and our interest would lie in those assets that would have synergies with our own operations , ' ' sempra spokesman doug kline said . ` ` beyond that i couldn ' t give you more specifics . ' ' dynegy today called off its purchase of enron , saying the energy trader breached covenants in the merger agreement . dynegy had agreed to buy enron for at least $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt this month . a federal investigation of accounting irregularities at enron had limited its ability to finance operations and sent its shares plunging . sempra shares fell 39 cents to $ 22 . 66 in late trading . enron shares fell $ 3 . 48 to 63 cents once they resumed trading after a halt for dynegy ' s announcement . enron shares have dropped 99 percent since the first of the year . houston - based enron has an ownership interest in argentina ' s 4 , 104 - mile natural - gas pipeline system , the largest pipeline system in south america . sempra energy international owns a 43 percent stake in two natural - gas utility holding companies in argentina . sempra also is the owner of the san diego gas & electric and southern california gas co . utilities . ` ` we are looking at selling our global assets that are not core to our business , and so we ' ll be continuing with an asset - sale program , ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne said . ` ` we are not going to comment on who we ' ve had discussions with or what the status of those is . ' ' in addition to its interest in enron assets , sempra has had discussions with enron employees who want to leave the company , kline said . ` ` a number of enron employees have approached us , as we ' re aware they ' ve approached other firms , ' ' kline said . enron office tower project in limbo after dynegy ends purchase 2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 42 ( new york ) enron office tower project in limbo after dynegy ends purchase houston , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s 1 . 17 - million - square - foot office tower project in downtown houston has been thrown into limbo after dynegy inc . abandoned its proposed purchase of the country ' s largest energy trader . the 40 - story tower at 1500 louisiana , next to enron ' s current headquarters , is scheduled to be completed in january , according to hines interests , the construction manager . the building , the first new houston skyscraper since 1987 , features floors as large as 52 , 00 square feet to accommodate enron ' s trading activities and a circular sky bridge nicknamed ` ` the saturn ring ' ' that connects the new tower with enron ' s existing building and a parking garage . ` ` dynegy occupies 700 , 000 square feet in houston and the thinking was that after they bought enron they would move their operations into the new tower , ' ' said will penland , senior managing director at property broker cb richard ellis ' s houston office . ` ` i guess that has fallen by the wayside now . ' ' enron ' s shares tumbled $ 3 . 42 to 69 cents in late trading as investors and analysts said the company may be forced into bankruptcy . standard & poor ' s corp . cut enron ' s credit rating to junk as bankers failed to raise $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . enron said it is suspending all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations . the cesar pelli & associates - designed tower , called enron center south , is clad in reflective glass and metal panels , and features sun shades on its south face , according to hines . the building ' s seven - story base includes five 52 , 000 square - foot floors . each of the top 33 stories is 25 , 000 square feet . when the project was announced two years ago , enron needed more space to house a growing workforce . its stock price hit a peak of $ 90 a share in august 2000 . the project kicked off a building boom for houston , with three other buildings now under construction that would add 2 . 05 million square feet to the city ' s office supply , according to prudential financial . the largest of these is a reliant resources project at 100 main street . this activity , combined with falling energy prices and job cuts at compaq computer corp . , continental airlines inc . , and other houston employers , may cause the city ' s downtown office vacancy rate to rise to the ` ` mid - teens ' ' in 2002 from 8 . 2 percent at the end of september , according to james sullivan , prudential ' s real estate analyst .

' s offshore oil and natural gas properties in india for $ 388 million in cash , the companies said wednesday . these properties are the last of the oil - and gas - producing properties houston - based enron retained after it spun off enron oil & gas , now named eog resources . the deal marks another step for houston - based enron away from owning large physical assets . the company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities . it is " another significant step for enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses , " the company said in a written statement . enron ' s other assets for sale in india include the controversial dabhol power project , india ' s largest private power plant , in which enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake . reports surfaced wednesday that enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $ 3 billion project at a discount . analysts have said for months now that enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer . tata power co . , india ' s largest private electricity firm , has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over dabhol . the oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the tapti natural gas field and the panna / mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of mumbai and a 62 . 6 percent interest in the offshore block cb - os / 1 exploration license . all are on the west coast of india . production from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8 , 200 barrels of oil per day . reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent . bg paid about $ 2 . 30 per barrel of oil equivalent . the other partners in the tapti and panna / mukta offshore operations are oil and natural gas corp . , which holds 40 percent , and reliance industries , with a 30 percent stake . the other partners in the cb - os / 1 license are hindustan oil exploration co . , with 17 . 36 percent , tata petrodyne with 10 percent , and oil and natural gas corp . with 10 percent . enron acquired its natural gas reserves in india with an eye to using them as fuel in the dabhol plant . in august , houston - based enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in dabhol for no less than $ 1 billion , an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project . dabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . it was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on india ' s west coast in june after the board stopped buying power . john ambler , enron spokesman , would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the dabhol project , but said the company favors selling its stake . " we continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of india and / or indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant , " ambler said . " we are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs . " the shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2 , 184 megawatts . other partners in dabhol include general electric and the bechtel construction firm , which each own 10 percent . the remaining 15 percent is held by the maharashtra state electricity board , the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located . bg ' s existing interests in india include holdings in western indian natural gas distributors gujarat gas co . and mahanagar gas . the company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from iran via pipeline into india . india ' s gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years , while its gas production is declining . edison rates to remain high under utility ' s deal with state by karen gaudette associated press writer 10 / 04 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . san francisco ( ap ) - consumer advocates warn that southern california edison customers , already saddled with last spring ' s record rate increase until 2003 , could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead . the deal secretly negotiated with the state public utilities commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by edison last november and is designed to keep the utility from following pacific gas and electric , the state ' s largest utility , into bankruptcy . it lets edison pay off more than $ 3 billion of a $ 3 . 9 billion debt , in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last may for at least the next two years . consumer advocates , however , said wednesday that other consequences of the state ' s power crisis could send rates higher still . the state ' s power - buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $ 43 billion of long - term power already contracted for delivery . the prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some edison customers . " we can ' t stay in business , " said william ho , general manager of top hat cleaners in west hollywood , where the monthly electric bill has gone from $ 600 before the state ' s energy crisis to nearly $ 1 , 200 . " we would have to raise prices , and we ' re already heading into a recession . " ho said top hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows . but he added , " you can ' t press clothes in the dark . " it ' s unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power - buying costs , said nettie hoge , executive director of the utility reform network , a san francisco - based consumer advocacy group . hoge and other consumer advocates said this week ' s deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of edison , which supported the state ' s failed deregulation plan . " it ' s like saying i ' m not going to beat you any harder , so it shouldn ' t hurt , " she said . john bryson , edison international president and chief executive officer , said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors . edison owes nearly $ 4 billion to hundreds of power companies , ranging from energy marketing giant enron corp . to the state independent system operator , manager of the state ' s power grid . " the agreement means stability , predictability , " he said during a conference call with reporters wednesday . " it means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work . " the puc said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power - buyer . commission president loretta lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy . " i think that this is a balanced compromise , but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt , " she said . the state department of water resources so far has spent $ 9 billion buying electricity for customers of edison , pacific gas and electric co . and san diego gas and electric co . the shareholder - owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers . the state ' s 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers . that price cap was the focal point of edison ' s lawsuit against the puc , with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers . under the deal struck this week , edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $ 1 . 2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt . the utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators , and that money also would have to help pay down the debt . the agreement now goes before u . s . district court judge ronald s . w . lew in los angeles , who could rule on it this week . " right now judge lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers . . . . will he pull out $ 3 . 3 billion for edison or will he protect the working men and women of california who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax ? " said douglas heller of the santa monica - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights , which organized a protest rally wednesday outside the federal courthouse in los angeles . heller estimated the settlement could cost edison ratepayers $ 750 each over the next four years . - - - on the net : http : / / www . sce . com http : / / www . cpuc . ca . gov http : / / www . turn . org copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . india press : enron unit defaults on interest payment 10 / 04 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones dow jones newswires ; 91 - 11 - 461 - 9426 ; himendra . kumar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business bg pays enron pounds 263 m for indian oil and gas our city staff 10 / 04 / 2001 the independent - london foreign 21 ( copyright 2001 independent newspapers ( uk ) limited ) bg is to buy enron ' s oil and gas assets off india ' s west coast for $ 388 m ( pounds 263 m ) in a move that will make the uk - based oil and gas producer the largest foreign investor in the country ' s upstream energy market . the deal will add 5 per cent to bg ' s total output , with 19 , 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day , of which 60 per cent is gas . according to david mcmanus , bg ' s executive vice president , it will be earnings accretive from day one .

" there is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this . " bg will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with gas authority of india ltd ( gail ) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset ( exploration field ) . however , the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields . currently , the fields yield 70 million standard cu . feet of gas per day and 8 , 200 barrels of oil per day . bg has a 50 per cent stake in mahanagar gas ltd , a gas supply company in mumbai . further , it is in the process of setting up an lng regassification terminal in pipavav . bg is not interested in buying out enron ' s upcoming lng regassification facility at dabhol since it is setting up its own lng regassification terminal at pipavav , gujarat , mr shaw said . mr shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields , there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the lng terminal and that from the exploration fields . on the pricing front , the tapti and panna - mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004 . beyond this period , the pricing is internationally linked . once the deal is completed , bg india plans to initiate talks with reliance industries ltd ( ril ) and ongc to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture , according to mr shaw . further , it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in london as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum . bg has so far invested $ 150 million in its ventures in the country . - our bureau copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . oct . 4 , 2001 houston chronicle former enron executive to head homeland security copyright 2001 houston chronicle army secretary thomas white , a former houston energy executive , has been picked to serve as the defense department ' s top official for homeland security . white will work closely with pennsylvania gov . tom ridge , who was named by president bush in the wake of the sept . 11 attacks to head a new cabinet - level office of homeland security . the new office will coordinate the efforts of more than 40 government agencies in tightening domestic security and rooting out terrorist threats . white was named to serve as the pentagon ' s liaison by secretary of defense donald rumsfeld on tuesday . white is a retired army brigadier general who became the army ' s top civilian executive in may . before he was nominated for the army post by bush , white was vice chairman of houston - based enron energy services .

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines . to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle . genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way . a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe . japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly . japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 . genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test . management : dr . tony milici -

2	Subject: ad hoc timeline review team mark - the ad hoc team ' s product is attached . it is a suggested revision to the nerc a 3 al time table for the wscc . some basic points are : * elimination of manually setting the wscc pre - schedule flag . the table provides rules for the e - tag software to automatically set the flag . * the majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment . the team agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ( i . e . , tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval entities would receive compensation for assessing / approving late tags , etc . ) . but , a financial mechanism would have to go through a cumbersome review / approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced world of e - tag and nerc ' s electronic scheduling . so , the suggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer the submittal time is to the start time . to do this , we considered three parameters - the assessment window , deferred denial , and the default composite status . * the assessment window is a period time that the e - tag authority service gives the approval services to assess a submitted tag . each approval service is to check the tag for various things and respond with a approved or denied vote back to authority service who then set the final composite status . * deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag , the composite status does not immediately become denied , but instead waits until the end of the assessment window to set the composite status . this allows the denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it , if appropriate . * the default composite status is a final stated reached at the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to actively approve or deny a tag . currently , tags submitted before a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to approved . tags submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to denied . for real - time tagging , we cite the hour - ahead business where purchasing - selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour . * tags submitted in the first half of the hour - ahead , referred to 0 to 30 past , will have a 10 minute assessment window , are subjected to deferred denial , and will default to approved / conditional . * tags submitted from 30 to 40 past , will have a 10 minute assessment window , are not subjected to deferred denial ( can be called instant denial ) , and but will still default to approved / conditional . * tags submitted in the after 40 past , will have a 5 minute assessment window , are not subjected to deferred denial ( can be called instant denial ) , and will default to denied ( thus assigned a composite status of late ) . * the table references specific times in the submittal and assessment process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard . the team was divided on the best approach . some suggested all times on the table be the prevailing time for the lca . this would require each ca to include in the e - tag registry their time zone . some suggested all times on the table be in pacific prevailing time . and some suggested that all times on the table be in pacific standard time . the conclusion is that a white paper would be produced prior to the july isas meeting discussing the pros and cons of each suggestion . * the group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag agent ' s time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service . * here ' s a big one - because the timing table allows for later submittal times , the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of the wscc standard ramp ( i . e . , currently starts at 10 minutes before the hour ) . we are recommending that isas request the oc to study the feasibility of moving the wscc standard ramp from a twenty minute duration straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour ( i . e . , starts at 0 : 55 and ends at 0 : 05 ) . such a change would align the wscc with the eastern interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag submittals . * there was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice for the tariff deadline for schedule changes ( most are set to 20 before the start ) . it was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner . * the team did not want to address at this time issues concerning multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in policy 3 or the e - tag specifications . * finally , the team can not stress enough that a composite status of late should not and does not mean automatic denial . the late designation simple indicates that the default composite status is denied . approval entities should make every effort to assess all tags , late or not . hurray for the team members , many , many thanks . > robert harshbarger puget sound energy oasis trading manager 425 . 882 . 4643 ( desk ) 206 . 604 . 3251 ( cell ) -

2	Subject: sun devil fuel ben and ron - - following up on our meeting today , i need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our sun devil project . how much ( if any ) can i discount the fuel charges for sun devil shippers , based on the following assumptions , project cost $ 911 mm include all compression adds / mods from doug cebryk engineering scope dated 9 / 28 / 01 incremental volume mmbtu / d : 780 , 000 san juan , 810 , 000 mainline , 500 , 000 to phoenix , 310 , 000 to cal border of 1 , 520 , 000 total capacity to cal border and 500 , 000 to phoenix , assume 390 , 000 has to come from east of thoreau assume load factors in 10 % increments from 50 % west flow up to 100 % . assume fuel collection of 5 % from shippers in theory , we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for sun devil , and the new compressors at stations 1 - 4 are more efficient , then the actual fuel use should be less . please verify this for the load factors above . if we can keep the same net fuel retainage , but collect less because our actual fuel use is less , then this is a win - win for both tw and the sun devil shippers . is an answer possible by tuesday 11 / 12 ? thanks kh x 35559

2	Subject: davis appoints cpuc commissioner gov . davis announced today his appointment of mike peevey as commissioner at the cpuc to replace com . bilas who resigned last week . mr . peevey is the former president of southern california edison and as such advocated deregulation . consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state senate approval . below is an article from the sacramento bee . gh davis names ex - edison chief to puc but the action stirs anger : ' our worst nightmare , ' says a consumer lawyer . by stuart leavenworth - - bee staff writer published 5 : 30 a . m . pst wednesday , march 6 , 2002 gov . gray davis has appointed a former president of southern california edison to a state panel charged with regulating edison and other public utilities . davis said michael r . peevey would bring " more than three decades of experience " to the public utilities commission - - experience that immediately came under fire from the state ' s consumer groups . mike florio , a lawyer for the utility reform network , said peevey has a record , both in government and in business , of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers . " this is a our worst nightmare , " florio said . " it is like putting dr . kevorkian in charge of a nursing home . " others were more supportive . d . j . smith , a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users , lauded peevey as someone " who understands all sides of the energy business " and will be fair to all sides . " i think he will be objective about edison because he doesn ' t owe edison anything , " said smith , noting that peevey left the southern california utility nine years ago . the husband of assemblywoman carol liu , d - south pasadena , peevey replaces puc commissioner richard bilas , who resigned last week . bilas was appointed by gov . pete wilson . if confirmed by the state senate , peevey will solidify davis ' control over the puc , a five - member board that now includes three of the governor ' s appointees . it also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state ' s other large utility , pacific gas and electric co . , on terms for pg & e ' s reorganization in federal bankruptcy court . pg & e spokesman ron low declined to comment on the appointment tuesday , but last year peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped pg & e avoid bankruptcy . hired by davis to negotiate with the utility , peevey reportedly struck a deal with pg & e chairman bob glynn that would have let pg & e charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity . but other davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart . for three years , peevey was president of edison international and southern california edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company chairman john bryson . peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of newenergy inc . , an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to aes corp . after working as an adviser to davis , he had been ceo of truepricing inc . and also has served on the board of excelergy corp . , an energy software company . with his new six - year puc job , peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants , water companies , natural gas supplies and other industries . after a review by puc lawyers , peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict , davis spokesman steve maviglio said . peevy ' s appointment was one of two davis made tuesday . he also appointed john l . geesman to the board of the independent system operator , which manages most of the state power grid . since 1985 , geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for rbc dain rauscher inc . in san francisco . he once served on turn ' s board . consumer groups , which had pressed for a meeting with davis for the past week , said the he may have timed his election day appointment of peevey to minimize negative media coverage . maviglio called that claim " ludicrous . " today ' s papers , he said , " will be some of the best read this year . "

2	Subject: fw : classic thoughts on texas a & m . . . fox sports show host jim rome 1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite ut . 2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation . like danny devito in " twins " . 3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good . all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in everything a & m does . 4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at a & m . there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas ' answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now , forget the fact that a however , nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat up civilians , move to israel . 5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game , some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board . some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give them a veil . 6 ) " t . u . " is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it . please learn . 7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight 185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base . this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid . 8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder , they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability . the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ? 9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now . 10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly . 11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending " dukes of hazard " episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool . as my friend stephen johnson once said : " if the world were ever to get an enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . " if you go to school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie . god bless the great state of texas . brian puls software engineer lockheed martin - enterprise solutions 281 218 - 2740

2	Subject: western issues 8 / 10 / 01 the following update has already been forwarded to tim belden . please let me know if you have any questions . thanks , kristin walsh x 39510 aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s ) kaiser aluminum kaiser aluminum has begun the recall of 40 to 50 workers to its mead smelter in washington . they are beginning the process of getting their operations back into productive capacity as they await load reduction negotiations with bpa - perhaps using the recall as a posturing tactic to threaten restart . kaiser wants bpa to give them $ 17 per megawatt hour to shut down operations for two years beginning october ( competitors are being paid $ 18 - $ 20 ) , but it seems unlikely that bpa will budge now that spot electricity prices have reached reasonable levels in the 50 mwh range . to make a long story short - kaiser botched their chance at a great deal and is now lining up the troops to threaten bpa into signing . alcoa aluminum alcoa is still in talks with bc hydro in regards to restarting its intalco smelter operations . consequently , the bottom line with the bpa load reduction agreement priced in at $ 18 - $ 20 per mwh and a rough estimate of $ 30 per mwh break - even point on electricity prices - alcoa could go to bc hydro with a much more aggressive bid on electricity . with current market prices floating near $ 50 per mwh and a $ 20 mwh load reduction payment from bpa for the next two years , there is a very real possibility alcoa could profitably restart operations if prices break lower and find a stable price there . contacts close to bc hydro are aggressively pursuing the inside track on these negotiations , particularly on the hydro ' s side of things . we are aiming to find out a potential restart date and will report when available . bc hydro bc government bc government has been allowed to gain intervener status in discussions regarding the sumas - 2 power plant sitting in northern washington state near the canadian border . this border dispute has been going on for the last 18 months , the canucks citing air pollution as a major public health hazard coming from a site so close to canadian cities . now the bc government has been allowed to sit in on sitting negotiations and provide its input - a large step forward for bc now that the ndp has been stripped of power . on the offshore drilling front , there has been no direct legislation this week , although it is believed that the greens and the remnants of the ndp environmentalists are on the ropes on this issue . sources indicate that the labor - environmentalist split that took the house democrats on the anwr vote in washington last week will likely mirror itself in the offshore drilling and forestry debates in british columbia . many labor groups have allied themselves with corporate interests in the past and are likely to do so again if the issue of oil royalties and jobs are at stake in northern british columbia . bc hydro there has been no real movement this week on the bc hydro front . they are awaiting the selection of their new chair and board upcoming by mid - september . bonneville power authority financial solvency senator patty murray has stated she will go to the mat on the anwr debate and that there will be no room for equivocation on this front . whether or not this opening salvo is meant as deterrence or smokescreen remains to be seen , although a reliable source suggests she is not willing to change her position in exchange for increased bpa funding . sources indicate that the bill before the senate to increase bpa ' s funding by $ 2 billion to a total $ 5 . 75 billion with the provision of annual reports to the senate was opposed by gop leadership in the senate and by the white house . it is likely that murray would scrap the bill altogether unless a viable alternative emerges . ferc oversight there remains a question as to whether or not chairman hebert ' s resignation at ferc will play a role in murray ' s decision - making . it is our understanding that upon hebert ' s resignation , a vacancy will open in ferc , and there are no restrictions to its partisanship since the commission will have two democrats and two republicans in it . that opening creates an opportunity for some individuals who were initially passed over the by white house to have another shot at becoming a ferc commissioner . we are entertaining two scenarios : ? the white house looks to use the ferc vacancy to gain influence in the anwr vote , should labor ' s influence not be strong enough to swing a victory . ? the white house is confident of the anwr victory and will appoint a republican to the position - most likely a contender on the short list being someone who was passed over recently in favor of woods . spill issues there are no additional spill issues that have been brought up this week . we are not expecting anything substantive until the end of august to come from this area . other dam issues pacificorp and the yakama indian nation have signed a preliminary agreement to file a joint competing license application with ferc for the priest rapids hydro project , now operated by grant county pud . representatives of the utility and the tribe indicate their goal is to more broadly share the benefits of the two - dam , 1900 - mw project with the region . grant county pud , which holds the existing license , now uses about 37 percent of the output ; the rest is under contract to 12 public and private utilities , with the region ' s four ious receiving the most . this is an example of the growing influence of tribal nations on water issues in the pacific northwest . while it is unlikely ( to say the least ) that tribal nations will take control of bpa - operated dams , they will increasingly become energy players in this region . forest fires the chelan blaze has been controlled and there are no major forest fires , which warrant disruption of electrical transmissions .

2	Subject: el paso responds to ferc on expansion potential el paso says it ' s open to expansion of system el paso natural gas " is willing to expand its system " to the california border if " sufficient support " for such a project can be demonstrated through long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc . the pipeline ' s comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed line 2000 crude - oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west . daniel m . adamson , director of ferc ' s office of energy projects , raised the prospect in a jan . 3 letter to el paso , saying that modifying the project " could assist the difficult situation " now facing the california gas market . specifically , the commission has recommended that el paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30 - inch diameter , 1 , 088 - mile crude oil pipeline from plains all american pipeline l . p . , and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service . the line extends from mccamey , tx , to bakersfield , ca . el paso plans to convert to gas service a 785 - mile segment from mccamey to ehrenberg , az . el paso proposed the line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression , and not as a system expansion . however , " there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished , " wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan . 15 . " el paso could add compression to the proposed line 2000 project , or it could replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place . " as a third option , he said el paso could add new compression to its existing system or loop either the existing system or line 2000 project . the " preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity , i . e . where they want to put gas into el paso ' s system and where they want the gas delivered , " clark said . as a " first step " towards gauging market support for an expansion , he noted that el paso on jan . 12 posted 1 . 2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline capacity for sale effective june 1 of this year . the capacity currently is held by affiliate el paso merchant energy , whose contracts expire may 31 . when the posting results are known , " el paso will determine whether another open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california . " if el paso finds there is an " unmet demand for additional capacity " on its system , the pipeline at that time " will evaluate whether an expansion of the existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , or both , is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , " clark noted . in the meantime , he urged the commission to approve el paso ' s application for the line 2000 project as it was filed . not only will the project " increase the operational flexibility " of el paso ' s current system , but converting the line from oil to gas service will be a " necessary prerequisite " to any future expansion of the pipeline ' s system , according to clark .

2	Subject: confirming what we already knew dynegy : enron a ' model competitor ' it doesn ' t happen very often , so we ' re noting an apparently spontaneous comment from dynegy counsel ed ross at a ferc roundtable last week that one of his chief competitors , enron , " has done an excellent job of being competitive . " he suggested others could look to enron as a " model competitor . they ' ve done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we don ' t see any problem with it . i think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the regulated and unregulated aspects of their business . " ross had prefaced the remark , midway through a heated debate on affiliate abuses , with the comment that " this is not an industry - wide problem . i believe there are good and bad players in the market today . " earlier , enron ' s leslie lawner had invited " all of you to spend the day on enron ' s trading floor , because i assure you , you will not see a more competitive environment anywhere . there is no way these folks , who fight like cats and dogs among themselves , would voluntarily transfer value to the pipeline group for the good of the bottom line . " lawner had to quickly back off the invitation - mentioning confidentiality restrictions - when it appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor .

" it ' s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define their roles differently , " said ken weilerstein , an analyst at gartner group inc . in stamford , conn . enron ' s plan also could help enterprise - level users get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they ' re renting , such as security and disaster recovery support , he added . ravi thuraisingham , director of global bandwidth risk management at enron broadband services , said the new offering won ' t include additional security features . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities , he said . initially , enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - - expects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed storage , depending on market conditions and the length of time a company expects to need the capacity . " we ' re there to try to discover a market clearing price , " said thuraisingham , adding that the service is tentatively due to go online in the third quarter . enron said it has already signed best buy co . , one of the leading retailers of consumer electronics , computers and software in the u . s . , to buy the storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management application through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months , according to thuraisingham . under enron ' s plan , storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company currently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching centers , or " pooling points , " in the u . s . , and another seven overseas . at first , the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily installed . but even there , thuraisingham said , enron is " pretty much in the initial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . " enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since the spring of 1999 . later that year , it also launched a web site called enrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas , electricity and other commodities . that quickly became the world ' s largest e - commerce site and is now said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily . norman levine enron broadband services 713 - 853 - 5010 norman _ levine @ enron . net

2	Subject: possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows : most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers . as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants . one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from . there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 . if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule . the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent . this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space . robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added . in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center . russell s . long enron net works , llc russell . long @ enron . com ( 713 ) 345 - 3754

' s plunge toward bankruptcy may spark legal wrangles over how to unravel the web of derivatives contracts tied to the energy company . enron is set to file for protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization ever . that ' s likely to mean the energy trader can ' t pay on derivatives it sold as insurance against default by other borrowers , as well as defaulting on its own debts and triggering similar contracts bought by its creditors . ` ` if i traded with joe bloggs down the road , and enron owed him a lot of money and he couldn ' t get it so he went into bankruptcy , then he wouldn ' t fulfill his obligations under my contract , ' ' said brian senior , head of trading at innogy holdings plc , the u . k . ' s top electricity supplier . ` ` i don ' t think the major risk is market liquidity , i think it ' s the domino effect . ' ' enron used derivatives - - financial instruments such as futures and options whose value is based on other assets - - to insure against price swings or take bets on a price ' s direction . the houston - based company had revenue of $ 1 . 9 billion from derivatives trading last year , more than double the $ 765 million in 1999 , making it one of the largest traders , according to swaps monitor publications inc . by comparison , williams cos . , the no . 2 u . s . natural - gas pipeline owner , had revenue of $ 1 . 29 billion on derivatives trading in 2000 . paul spraos , president of swaps monitor , a research company that compiles trading figures , said enron only posts derivatives statistics once a year so there are no figures for 2001 . dynegy inc . abandoned its planned merger with enron on wednesday , leaving it with more than $ 15 billion of debt and the possibility of bankruptcy . as well as oil and gas futures , enron trades derivatives based on such things as weather and information - transmission capacity , known as bandwidth . banned from trading spraos estimates that as of sept . 30 , enron owed $ 18 . 7 billion on derivatives trades that went sour , though he said that doesn ' t take into account the collateral enron probably posted to back up the trades . the european energy exchange today banned enron from trading its products , while australian regulators barred the company ' s finance unit , enron australia pty , from trading electricity futures because its funding wasn ' t assured . u . s . senate and house committees will investigate enron ' s decline and consider new regulations for electricity and natural - gas trading . the securities and exchange commission is also examining the company . enron had $ 201 billion worth of derivatives on oil , gas and electricity at the end of last year , swaps monitor has reported . that ' s measuring the notional amount , the face value of the securities on which the derivatives are based . ` quantifying it ' ` ` everyone will be looking at their exposure , whether they ' ve got collateral , and quantifying it , ' ' said robert g . pickel , chief executive officer of the international swaps and derivatives association . isda , a new york - based trade association representing more than 550 companies that trade derivatives , designed the legal contracts typically used in derivatives transactions . pickel said those contracts are designed to address such situations . ` ` there are two potential issues relating to isda documentation , as a result of the situation regarding enron , ' ' pickel said . the first involves companies that have entered derivatives trades with enron using isda ' s standard contract , known as the master agreement . the second concerns banks that have provided credit protection on enron in the form of a credit - default swap , also using isda documents . credit - default swaps work like insurance on a company ' s bonds or loans . they pay out if there ' s a bankruptcy , default , debt restructuring or similar occurrence , known as a credit event . ` ` if there ' s a bankruptcy filing there ' s no question it would be a credit event , ' ' pickel said . ` can ' t tell ' enron ' s u . k . units are in administration , which has triggered what lawyers define as a credit event , said simon firth , head of the credit derivatives practice at linklaters & alliance , which is acting for , the accountant for enron ' s european arm . ` ` the documents are fairly robust , and we ' ve been through issues before , ' ' firth said . he said that while ` ` each time the documentation gets strengthened , you can ' t tell what happens until you look at the individual cases . ' ' enron owes almost two dozen energy companies about $ 700 million . j . p . morgan , the bank that advised enron in the failed merger with dynegy , said it was owed $ 500 million for unsecured loans . canadian imperial bank of commerce was owed $ 215 million in loans and credit derivatives . in europe , abn amro may set aside $ 97 . 5 million to cover its enron exposure . the energy company owes abbey national plc $ 164 million , and dresdner bank ag said its exposure is about $ 100 million . ` ` this one has left every head shaking , and people are wondering how to organize by class of creditor and how to hire counsel , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an analyst at creditsights inc . in new york . ` ` lawyers are high - fiving . ' ' enron ' s legal woes to make bankruptcy case complex , 2001 - 11 - 30 12 : 41 ( new york ) enron ' s legal woes to make bankruptcy case complex , houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s legal problems , one reason for the collapse of the world ' s largest energy trader , would add to the complexity of a bankruptcy filing and might take years to resolve , experts say . with dynegy inc . having withdrawn a proposed $ 23 billion takeover offer , enron is weighing what would be the largest bankruptcy in history and may go to court within a week . enron shareholders , employees and business partners are lining up to sue the houston - based company after its shares lost $ 26 billion in value since mid - october . enron restated $ 586 million in earnings because of accounting irregularities , and questions surfaced about conflicts of interest among some of the company ' s executives . the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating the company , and that wouldn ' t be affected by a bankruptcy filing . ` ` there are so many legal tentacles to this thing it ' s scary , ' ' said chuck tatelbaum , former vice president for research at the american bankruptcy institute . ` ` we could be talking about a six - year bankruptcy case here . ' ' lawsuits seeking damages from a company under chapter 11 are pulled into the bankruptcy case and judgments or settlements are converted into bankruptcy claims . fraud claims among the suits likely to be included in a bankruptcy case are claims by shareholders that the company misled investors about its financial health . another category would be allegations that enron executives improperly prevented workers from moving 401 ( k ) investments out of the company ' s stock . enron probably would face accusations it broke energy trading contracts . the agreements , known as derivatives , were used as insurance against price swings in the energy market . with the company poised to file for chapter 11 , it is expected to miss payments under the contracts . there ' s also the developing battle between enron and dynegy over the failed buyout bid that might end up in bankruptcy court . that might lead a bankruptcy judge to take a look at the recent court case involving tyson foods inc . and ibp inc . , a beef producer . a judge in delaware ordered tyson to complete its buyout of ibp after their proposed combination collapse . tyson , like dynegy , had said it wasn ' t fully informed about ibp ' s financial problems when it negotiated to acquire the beef producer . dynegy said today it plans to take over enron ' s northern natural gas co . pipeline unit next month . dynegy said it ' s entitled to the pipeline under the terms of its nov . 9 merger agreement that gave it $ 1 . 5 billion in preferred stock in northern natural gas . enron could sue as part of the bankruptcy case to stop dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . complications any chapter 11 cases would be ` ` inordinately complicated , ' ' said lynn lopucki , a law professor at the university of california at los angeles . the largest bankruptcy on record is texaco ' s $ 35 . 9 billion filing in 1987 . enron lists $ 61 billion in assets . other big companies , like w . r . grace & co . and sgl carbon inc . , used bankruptcy filings to manage lawsuits , said ken eckstein , a new york attorney who handles bankruptcy litigation . w . r . grace , a financially healthy chemical maker , filed for chapter 11 protection in april to cope with asbestos - related lawsuits . sgl carbon is the u . s . unit of a german company with a market value of more than $ 1 . 2 billion that makes products used in steel production . sgl filed bankruptcy papers in 1999 to dispose of customers ' suits over price - fixing claims . what sets enron apart are the questions about its financial viability , eckstein said . he represented customers suing sgl as part of the bankruptcy case . ` ` here , you have a fundamentally broken company , ' ' eckstein said . ` ` it may never emerge from bankruptcy . ' ' that makes it tougher to gauge how much other creditors might recover , he said . ` makes me mad ' enron investors aren ' t optimistic about the future of the company ' s shares . ` ` i took at least a 60 percent hit on them , ' ' said jim anders , a columbia , south carolina , lawyer who has sold shares . ` ` it really makes me mad . i ' d like to get my hands on some of those executives who were doing the insider deals . that really shook people ' s confidence in the company . ' ' enron ' s fall was accelerated by questions about some partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial reports hid the significance of the partnerships . enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their dealings with enron , the company disclosed . fastow and other executives later were fired over their connection to the partnerships . anders acknowledged that bankruptcy law puts shareholders and litigants at the back of the repayment line . ` ` i know we ' ve had it and aren ' t going to get squat back , ' ' anders said . ` ` the company led us to believe enron was as solid as ge or one of the big banks . now the bank is busted . ' ' enron might raise $ 610 mln in brazil asset sale , analysts say 2001 - 11 - 30 13 : 24 ( new york ) enron might raise $ 610 mln in brazil asset sale , analysts say sao paulo , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . may be able to raise as much as $ 610 million from the sale of assets in brazil , including two power plants and stakes in two gas distributors , analysts and investors said . the u . s . energy trader , which is on the brink of bankruptcy , also might reduce the $ 700 million price tag on its 99 percent stake in power distributor elektro - eletricidade e servicos sa that it has tried to sell for more than a year , analysts said . ` ` they would sell those assets to make a quick buck , ' ' said marcos severine , a power utility analyst at sudameris corretora . about 56 percent of enron ' s $ 6 . 5 billion of overseas assets were in south america , most in brazil , as of june 30 . enron said it currently plans no change to its operations in the country . the u . s . company is expected to file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history , which may force the company to sell assets to pay about $ 15 billion of debt . dynegy inc . this week abandoned its proposed merger with enron . enron , which had less than $ 2 billion of cash as of last week , has more than $ 61 billion in assets . enron may fetch as much as $ 190 million from the sale of eletrobolt , a 380 - megawatt power plant , and $ 220 million from riogen , another power plant , severine said . both are based in rio de janeiro . gas companies enron also may be able to raise $ 200 million from the sale of stakes in two natural gas distributors , said a spokesman for petros , the employee pension fund of petroleo brasileiro , which is bidding for one of the companies . brazilian energy regulators already have approved the sale , though it still requires backing from antitrust regulators . if enron tries again to sell elektro , it may be required to offer the company to the federal government at a discount or to another private company , analysts said . the country ' s regulations aren ' t clear , they said . regulatory approval may delay any sale of assets in brazil . in addition , price controls in brazil ' s power industry will limit the amount of money enron will be able to raise from the sales , analysts said . investors are demanding lower prices for power companies in brazil after electricity rationing and price controls over the past two years cut earnings of power distributors and generators , analysts said . elektro has posted losses for six quarters . venezuela , mexico a bankruptcy filing by enron would probably result in the cancellation of its investment plans in venezuela , latin america ' s largest oil and natural gas producer , analysts said . enron had been slated to invest three - quarters of the $ 700 million needed to build a liquid natural gas processing plant with state oil company petroleos de venezuela sa . pdvsa officials declined to comment on whether the plant , which would cool natural gas until it liquefies , would go on with a new partner . enron , which also owns a small venezuelan power company , pulled out of exploration in 2000 from an offshore block in the gulf of paria between venezuela and trinidad and tobago . enron also has smaller investments in mexico , argentina and colombia . enron holds 20 percent of a joint venture building a $ 189 million power plant in monterrey , mexico . tractebel sa took an 80 percent share in the project in november . colombia enron and promigas sa , a colombian natural gas pipeline operator , each have a 50 percent stake in centrogas sa , a natural gas pipeline that transports about 400 million cubic feet of gas a day about 900 kilometers from the northern guajira peninsula to barrancabermeja , the main oil refining city in central colombia . the gas is produced at an offshore field operated by texaco . officials at promigas weren ' t available for comment . enron closed its administrative office in colombia about three months ago , leaving an attorney to represent it in colombia . enron ' s argentine assets include azurix buenos aires sa , a natural gas and water utility , and shares in transportadora de gas del sur sa . perez companc , which owns shares in transportadora , is prohibited by law from increasing its stake in the distribution company . ` ` if the law is modified , then yes , we would consider it , ' ' said mario grandinetti , head of perez companc ' s institutional relations . ` ` but there are also economic issues to consider . ' bush spokesman fleischer comments on enron corp .

' ' enron ' s board was compromised by financial ties ( correct ) 2001 - 11 - 30 15 : 01 ( new york ) enron ' s board was compromised by financial ties ( correct ) ( corrects percentage of natco group sales that went to enron to 0 . 16 percent in 25 th paragraph , and adds that sales are within council of institutional investors standards in 26 th paragraph . ) new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . plunged from the largest energy trader to the verge of bankruptcy under a board of directors whose independence was undercut by financial ties to management , according to corporate governance experts . enron gave seven of its 14 directors consulting contracts , sales to their business or donations to their non - profit institutions , according to company and public records . the recipients include three members of enron ' s audit committee , which is responsible for financial oversight . lord john wakeham , for example , a former leader of the british house of commons , sits on the audit committee . enron gave him a $ 72 , 000 - a - year consulting contract . john mendelsohn , president of the md anderson cancer center in houston , is also on the audit committee . in the last five years , enron and its chairman kenneth lay have donated $ 567 , 900 to the cancer center . ` ` to get on a board you have to be ` clubbable , ' but this looks like collegiality turning to cronyism , ' ' said allan cleveland , counsel to the new hampshire retirement system , an enron shareholder . enron , based in houston handled almost a quarter of all natural gas and electricity trades . during the past seven weeks , its board has presided over a $ 26 billion drop in market value that began after the company wrote down $ 1 . 2 billion in shareholder equity and reported it had overstated earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 . responsibility as enron ' s shares fell , the company suffered a cash crunch . it sought an infusion of capital and agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , a houston - based rival . that plan collapsed yesterday as investors balked at investing $ 1 . 5 billion , prompting dynegy to withdraw its offer . enron shares today fell another 39 percent , or 24 cents , to 37 cents per share . the stock began the year trading at $ 83 . 125 . corporate boards are responsible for protecting shareholder interests by reviewing the work of top executives . to accomplish that , two - thirds of a board should be ` ` independent ' ' from management , according to the council of institutional investors , which represents pension funds . independence the council defines an independent director as ` ` a person whose directorship constitutes his or her only connection to the corporation . ' ' ` ` consulting contracts , donations to non - profit organizations linked to directors , this eats away at independence , ' ' said ann yergen , the council ' s director of research . corporate governance standards established by the new york and nasdaq stock exchanges say all audit committee members should be independent . enron board members , including wakeham and mendelsohn , declined repeated requests for interviews . vance meyer , a company spokesman , said enron could not immediately respond to questions regarding the board . enron ' s board met nine times in 2000 , with each member receiving annual compensation of $ 79 , 000 in cash and stock . every member attended at least 75 percent of the meetings , except ronnie chan , chief executive of the hang lung group , a hong kong development business , according to company filings . relationships based on enron proxy statements and other documents , the following relationships existed between enron and board members : - - robert a . belfer , 65 , has been on the board since 1983 and sits on the executive committee . he is enron ' s largest individual shareholder , with 8 . 5 million shares , and is chairman and chief executive of belco oil & gas corp . , which operates from an office overlooking new york ' s central park . in 2000 , belco had $ 32 million in trade settlements and $ 1 million in option premiums with enron trade resources corp . , an enron subsidiary . - - john urquhart , 72 , a former general electric co . executive , sat on the board until last may . he received an annual consulting fee from enron of almost $ 200 , 000 a year as a special adviser to the enron chairman . - - mendelsohn , 64 , is a physician who was formerly head of medicine at memorial sloan - kettering cancer center in new york . he pioneered research in controlling cancer through the chemistry of a tumor ' s growth and was on president george w . bush ' s short list to head the national institutes of health . since 1996 , mendelsohn has been president of the m . d . anderson cancer center , part of the university of texas health system . donations mendelsohn joined enron ' s board in 1999 . enron has donated $ 221 , 650 to the cancer center . lay and a foundation he established with his wife , the linda and ken lay family foundation , have donated $ 346 , 250 in the last five years . the enron foundation pledged $ 1 . 5 million for a new clinic . - - charles lemaistre , 77 , headed the anderson cancer center for 18 years until retiring in 1996 . he has been an enron board member for 16 years , is a member of the executive committee and chairs the compensation committee . that panel awarded lay a $ 20 million - a - year severance package that he renounced two weeks ago . - - wendy gramm , 56 , has held positions at the federal trade commission and the u . s . office of management and budget and was chairman of the u . s . commodity futures trading commission . she is director of regulatory studies at the mercatus center of george mason university in fairfax , virginia . she is married to phil gramm , a u . s . republican senator from texas . in the last three years , enron and the ken and linda lay family foundation have donated more than $ 50 , 000 to the university and the mercatus center , according to university records . consulting fee - - wakeham , 68 , a chartered accountant and self - made millionaire , became a force in the government of former u . k . prime minister margaret thatcher . he was known as her ` ` mr . fix - it .

2	Subject: free ! - home internet money - making business - free ! - advertising and email - marketing software - free ! you are receiving this mail because you have expressed interest in business opportunity offers . if i have reached you by mistake , please accept my deepest apologies and see the remove option at the end of this message . sincerely yours , jim johnson dear friend : this is an improved version of a highly successful marketing program that will make you many thousands of $ $ in the next few months . the new features - a software program for extracting email addresses and over 2 , 000 url ' s of bulletin boards , plus links to other many thousands of places where such addresses can be extracted - all free . take advantage of these new marketing tools and become rich fast . please read carefully the entire message below and enroll today . as seen on national tv : this is the media report . parents of 15 - year - old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet ! ! ! does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) and reported elsewhere in the world . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old son ' s closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labeled piles . " my first thought was that he had robbed a bank " , says the 41 - year - old woman , " there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year " . the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boy ' s school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . as it turns out , the boy had been sending out via email a type of " report " to email addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . " i just got the email one day and i figured what the heck . i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out " , says the clever 15 - year - old . the email letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks , if you sent out the letter with your name at the bottom of the 5 - address list . " i get junk email all the time , and really did not think it was going to work " , the boy continues . within the first few days of sending out the email , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills . " about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter . " " i thought i was in trouble or something " . he goes on , " i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all " . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the email . " the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework " . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . " i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street . " surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . a reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called " chain - letter " the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , " please send me report number xyx " . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee . [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 + - please continue reading . what appears below is what the 15 - year - old was sending out on the net - you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] . dear friend : " making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $ 25 u . s . dollars expense one time " . thanks to the computer age and the internet ! be a millionaire like others within a year ! ! before you say " bull " , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are " absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost " . due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained , it is currently working better than ever . this is what one had to say : " thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received a total $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in " . pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey . here is another testimonial : " this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i only made $ 240 . 00 , but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything .

remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mail . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 emails each or more ? there are over 250 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is email them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the email they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . ( euro or english pounds also are accepted ) checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your email address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 " the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet " plus the free extract software as an attachment . order report # 1 from : james g . johnson p . o . box 356 powell , ohio 43065 usa report # 2 " the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the internet " order report # 2 from : ilian ab . popov p . o . box 218 stara zagora 6000 bulgaria report # 3 " the secrets to multi - level marketing on the internet " order report # 3 from : walter s . stuart p . o . box 4028 beeville , tx 78104 usa report # 4 " how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multi - level marketing and the internet " order report # 4 from : kenneth i . purfey 4960 almaden expy . # 331 san jose , ca 95118 - 2007 usa report # 5 " how to send 1 , 000 , 000 e - mails for free " order report # 5 from : mia p . larson p . o . box 45537 2397 king george highway surrey , b . c . canada v 4 a 9 n 3 there are currently more than 250 , 000 , 000 people online worldwide ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending emails until you do . after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending emails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of emails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . . . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more emails and your name will be on everyone of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * more testimonials * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * " my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago . i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving ' ' junk mail ' ' . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i ' ' knew ' ' it wouldn ' t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old ' ' i told you so ' ' on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45 days she had received a total of $ 147 , 200 . 00 all cash ! i was shocked . i have joined jody in her ' ' hobby ' ' .

2	Subject: greetings dear friend , you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my introduction is that i am blossom makenbi , the first daughter of zuma makenbi one of the most popular black farmer in zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through network online hence decided to write you . before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg to deposit the sum of usd $ 9 . 5 million ( nine million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ) in one of the private security company , as he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and  emicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers , and this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society . in fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that , i and my family fled zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my ?thers money to a more reliable foreign account . since the law of netherlands prohibits a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of netherlands , as the eldest daughter of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . the south ? rican government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of south africa for fear of going through the same experience in future , both countries have similar political history . as a business minded lady , i am seeking for a partner who i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i want you to do for me , is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment ( funds ) from their afiliate office here in the netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the netherlands from south africa . but before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money i intend to use for investment . i have two options for you . firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction

" but he added that the court couldn ' t assume the committee would divulge the confidential documents and enron ' s constitutional rights weren ' t " jeopardized by delivery of their secrets to the document depository . " on the other motion , to quash the subpoena , the judge found the committee did follow proper procedure when serving enron officials . attorneys for the committee and enron will return to court thursday on the tentative rulings . kobayashi set a court date for sept . 7 on the third motion , which is a request for an injunction of the committee ' s investigation and contempt proceedings . enron officials didn ' t immediately return calls from the associated press seeking comment . enron officials have said the company is prepared to turn over 25 , 000 documents that were already in california , but that other documents the committee wants are in texas and out of the panel ' s reach . the committee found enron in contempt for not turning over the documents . a full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full senate , which has not voted on it . a contempt report on reliant energy has also been sent to the senate . a contempt finding against mirant corp . was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in sacramento for the committee ' s investigators . if the full senate imposes sanctions against reliant or enron , it will be the first time since 1929 , when the senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations involving cement sales to the state . folder name : rahil jafry relevance score on scale of 100 : 83 to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

2	Subject: mlcrosoft update alert - january 28 th minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack " indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

2	Subject: federal legislative update congressional republicans draft energy bill to aid the west rep . joe barton has spliced together emergency legislation aimed at aiding energy markets in the western united states via funding for improvements in california ' s constrained transmission line sp - 15 and directing federal disaster officials to prepare for power outages . the move by republicans came as democratic criticism of the bush administration ' s response to the california power crisis intensified wednesday . although the bill will not contain the price caps sought by democrats and a handful of republicans , barton said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committee deliberations . a list circulated by gop staff in recent weeks includes a range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules , subject to a governor ' s request ; increasing federal energy assistance to low - income consumers ; firing up mothballed power plants ; and directing federal facilities to reduce energy use by 10 % . additionally , the bill would grant governors the flexibility to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to temporarily keep operating during emergencies .

2	Subject: ranks communication after getting your imput , i think this is the best : we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus . let me know what you think . thanks bob

2	Subject: dispatch within maharashtra jim , please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra . i have also sent the presentation we made to you to wade . he is to get back on when would be an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me . vince , stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca ' s calender for friday , and we will make the complete pitch to her . it would be great if you too could be present at the meeting . if it is possible , please do let me know . on the attached slides , please note that : the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff , mseb liability for the entire capacity payment is not considered . the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra when variable o & m costs , fixed o though in some months ( jan ) it goes as high as $ 69 mm . hence , overall , mseb can pay for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided , they are not paying for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant . in conclusion , therefore , mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a seasonal basis . this means that the power remaining to be sold to other states is the difference between that and 2184 mw . however , since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally , it may mean that we need to market seasonal products to other states , not long term blocks . these are our conclusions . we may continue to work some more on the fuel and hedging side . if you have any more questions for me , please let me know , else for now there will not be any new henwood runs . regards , sandeep .

2	Subject: chuck ' s numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 bps in fees so we are slightly better than forecast . the 65 bps was comp for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from s & p and moodys . had we not run into the el paso issues the number would have held . given that the new structure requires a new market , new rating agency process and new documentation , we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction . an increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market . i still believe a sept 30 closing is unrealistic . if all goes well , i think we can be done by mid oct . to reach a sept 30 closing , i think the only option would be to ask bank of america to underwrite and buy the whole thing . that would likely be an expensive option . we can discuss in much more detail at our 9 am mtg tomorrow . i ' d be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to sep 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale 2 weeks later ( ideally before 3 q earnings release ) . the assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately el paso ' s credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit . just my thoughts . ps : your gift made my day . i ' m fully recovered and back on pace . thanks . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sent from my blackberry wireless handheld ( www . blackberry . net )

2	Subject: western issues update 7 / 27 / 01 below is the weekly western issues update sent to tim earlier . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me ( x 39510 ) . executive summary bc hydro british columbia energy politics bpa developments forestry issues smelter update bc hydro the crown jewel in bc government ' s arsenal , bc hydro is in a holding pattern until they can name a new chair to head up the corporation . brian smith was replaced with interim chairman robert fairweather , but we do not expect fairweather to have a long tenure - the word is gordon campbell and company are seeking a replacement to fill mr . smith ' s shoes as early as mid - august . we expect key changes to occur in hydro ' s executive and board of directors following the appointment of the new chair . although senior management at bc hydro is relatively comfortable with the company ' s financial position and competitiveness , they will be pursuing a strategy of expanding generation capability through new dams and oil / gas exploration , pending environmental approvals . as a part of bc hydro ' s move to look for additional generating capacity , they are turning to a pair of mega - projects that were scrapped a decade ago . bc hydro has commissioned new technical review studies of the 900 mw site c hydroelectric project near fort st . john and the 2 , 000 mw coal - fired hat creek project near kamloops . in terms of a rate hearing , we do not expect bc hydro to conduct a rate hearing until the new chairman is appointed . it will be difficult to get rates raised , although with the government budget deficit looming there will be considerable pressure to begin looking this direction . another key revenue challenge for bc hydro will be responding to the recent price caps imposed by ferc on western power markets and potential power purchase refunds to california ( though their contributions are not immense , they are still significant ) . bc energy politics things have really heated up in victoria now that the new campbell administration is settling in . earlier , we reported that the office of the premier had taken control of all the agencies and political staffing decisions . with 77 of the 79 elected members of the bc legislature , sources close to the premier indicate change will be " fast and furious " to offset any local coverage from volatile media . the bc government ' s primary focus will be to stimulate the economy while trying to restrain government spending . to that extent , they have instituted an across the board 25 % stimulus tax cut and will have to deal with the deficit issues that that cut entails . one of the ways they are looking to balance things out is to outsource crown assets and look for other areas to generate revenue - new sources of government revenue through oil and gas exploration and energy will be a top priority . minister of energy and mines , richard neufeld , will be one of the main drivers behind the current fast - tracking of the offshore oil and natural gas exploration . there is a great deal of pressure on the bc liberals to balance this budget and they will be looking at ways of delivering revenue sources through oil and gas exploration permitting as a short - term solution . neufeld has reviewed the backhouse report ( northern development commission ) regarding the need for continued local public input and has basically tossed it aside - the report had not gone far enough to please the liberals . other things on the minister of energy ' s agenda : ? oppose sumas 2 power project & phase out burarrd thermal ( sumas has been a serious bone of contention between washington state and canada ) ? with core review , protect bc hydro and all of its core assets , including dams , reservoirs , and power lines under public ownership ? restore independent bc utilities commission , to re - regulate bc hydro ' s electricity rates ? maintain the longstanding ban on bulk water exports ? encourage mineral exploration ? promote clean and renewable alternative energy sources ? review and make recommendations regarding allocation of funding that has been frozen for the " power for jobs " initiative bpa senator patty murray moved last week to drop the review provision on the senate bill , which would have opened up an additional $ 2 billion for bpa borrowing authority . if senator murray is successful , the measure could have a substantial impact on bpa financial solvency . with the exception of the approximately $ 5 million spill over the dalles and bonneville dams , bpa has already foregone a major summer spill to protect endangered salmon species . representatives of four northwest governors ventured to washington dc last week to express concerns over the new hydro biop and how it will be implemented . states were concerned about their lack of input in the implementation process - a plan being developed by action agencies and spearheaded by bpa . the plan has been put on hold pending a review headed by interior department lawyer ann klee . idaho and washington representatives showed concern that the biop could be overturned in court - they were concerned that the nmfs underestimated the risk of extinction of snake river stocks and that it was illegal to rely on off - site mitigation to help satisfy the hydro system ' s esa obligations . while the administration has said it plans to double past expenditures to implement the biop , nobody at the meeting could come up with just what the previous biop costs were - for now , the salmon plan is pure lip service . smelter curtailments kaiser : faced with declining aluminum prices , which have decreased 9 % from last year , kaiser is in a difficult position due to the fact that they are maintaining a level of infrastructure and personnel - readiness which will allow them to restart 4 - 3 / 4 ' s lines of their operations on the fly . should this curtailment last longer than a year , it would be cost - prohibitive for them to continue incurring that infrastructure expense . kaiser has gone on the record to say it is still open to signing load a curtailment agreement with bpa , but it is unclear at this time whether bpa foresees a benefit in signing an agreement considering short - term and perceived mid - term electricity price decreases . we are continuing to monitor this situation as it develops , although an agreement in the short - term seems doubtful . alcoa : recently mentioned in the press , canada ' s newfoundland government and u . s . aluminum giant alcoa inc . announced thursday they would conduct a feasibility study to possibly revive the stalled lower churchill hydroelectric project in the remote labrador region . the generating station on gull island could produce up to 2 , 000 mw of electricity . costs of the project are estimated at some c $ 4 billion ( $ 2 . 6 billion ) , far below the c $ 10 billion originally thought . with a 16 % drop in net income due to slackening global aluminum demand and higher energy prices , alcoa has suffered along with the rest of the aluminum industry to find cheaper , less volatile sources of electricity . along with their ongoing negotiations with bc hydro , it appears alcoa is making a determined push to work with the canadians to play all sides of a competitive electricity market . forestry issues there are a number of fuel management projects which are going on right now in the bitterroot national forest . ecosystem management burn - burnt fork ecoburn - completed 7 / 01 fuels reduction - sheafman fuel project - completed fuels reduction - darby ranger district * trapper overlook - 10 / 01 expected decision date * como restoration - 9 / 01 expected decision date * como campground - 9 / 01 expected decision date fuels reduction - sula ranger district * springer memorial fuel hazard reduction project - completed multi - forest ecosystem management burn - west fork ranger district * salmon river canyon project - ongoing , preparing supplemental draft fuels reduction - sula ranger district * sam billings camp ground fuel reduction - completed steep creek fuel reduction - 10 / 01 expected decision date

2	Subject: business partnership ( urgent / confidential ) mr . vincent nnaji , standard trust bank ltd , lagos , nigeria . dear sir , i am mr . vincent nnaji , bank manager of standard trust bank , lagos , nigeria . i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you . on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant foreign contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation mr . james herbert made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 20 m ( twenty million united states dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 20 m has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe - keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $ 1 m . i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney . all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple . i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes . the money will be shared in the ratio of 70 % for me and 25 % for you and 5 % will take care of all expenses . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately via my private email address . upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest . thanks and regards , mr . vincent nnaji .

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf dear shareholder , addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading . up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market . our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ; with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the various projects they are currently working on . e - direct is another example ; we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus . as of today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) , a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial , accounting and financing for companies in the energy field , from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask ; why the energy related field ? simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching $ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector . according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this year alone , most of which is because of china . the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30 level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone . there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field . these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non - energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own . i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies . we can then continue to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy - related businesses over the next 12 months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records , inc . announces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo fine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development corporation , inc .

2	Subject: hill stimulus bill update : 10 / 16 / 01 us treasury sec ' y o ' neill has been out in front this week as an administration voice trying to shape the parameters of the hill debates ( trying to keep the lid on some proposals that could have long - term costs for the budgets several years out ) . it will continue to be a delicate balance , as the administration is looking to get a final bill by the end of next week and get money into pockets in time for the end of the year . fed chair greenspan could also critically affect the debate tomorrow in testimony before the joint economic committee : his core belief is that whatever the precise stimulus number arrived at , it should be primarily temporary in character . his preference under current conditions is for security and fiscal policy to be the response instruments in the face of the diminishing returns to and efficacy of further rate reductions in the face of uncertainty . competitive analysis will continue to follow this issue closely and welcomes feedback and further specific questions on the issues below . please contact brendan fitzsimmons at x 5 - 4763 with further questions . enron global markets competitive analysis hill stimulus bill update : 10 / 16 / 01 partisanship is the question for senate battle : final stimulus bill likely in the $ 80 - 110 b range , but hill dems ' and repubs ' aims could push it northward summary senate numbers look set to exceed bush figures ( $ 60 - 75 b ) , may approach house ways and means $ 100 b ; final conferenced bill could hit $ 140 b ; all on this on top of the special $ 55 b approved right after the attacks for airlines and immediate impact areas republican plan , so far , all tax cuts and no spending democratic plan has a lot more spending , but it is all on supporting people who have lost their jobs and none of it is on infrastructure final , conferenced bill may run as high as $ 140 b if the ' neglected ' middle - class is given another rebate check ( up to another $ 38 b ) one major question hanging over size , composition and speed of the senate package is whether senate maj . leader daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan senate package that tries to isolate the house republicans and their business tax cutting agenda daschle will present dilemma to president bush and his senior advisers . " we will tell the president that we need assurance from the white house that compromises we make will be supported by the white house . if bush can ' t give that assurance - unable to control the right - then we will probably opt for the more partisan position . " report the centrifugal pull of a big number like $ 100 b proved the main attractor in early action on the stimulus front . house ways and means committee votes approved a tax cut package - mainly for businesses - that added up to just about exactly that number . the senate will produce something a little smaller , but the handwriting is on the wall as the two houses of congress move toward a conference committee package that could easily top that total . one key member of the senate negotiations told sources late sunday : " we are working on a package designed to stay with the principle that everything should be temporary and roll off after one year to avoid blowing through budget surpluses later . right now we are still aiming to stay in bush ' s $ 60 b to $ 75 b bracket , but everyone knows the final number will go up from there . " although senate process is controlled by democrats , senate finance committee chairman baucus ( dem ) is in a highly contested re - election campaign next year in a deeply republican state . just as he did with the earlier bush tax cut plan , you can expect him to reach out to work with senior republicans ( such as grassley ) despite the wishes of more partisan members of the leadership . likely elements of the democratic senate package : rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $ 300 or $ 600 rebate . this was also in the house republican package . temporary investment incentive for businesses - this could easily be 30 % - but they will keep it to one year . some form of extending the loss - carryback for businesses and allowing one - year use of amt credits in 2002 . the loss - carryback is quite likely because of the relatively small 10 - year costs . for democrats amt is more complicated . ( see below ) some form of expanded unemployment insurance incentive - not just extending the number of weeks , but other elements to expand who is eligible . 50 % rebate for unemployed workers who pay for extended health care benefits through the cobra program . partisanship question : there are a series of senior democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since house republicans will simply " pocket the concessions we make toward republican - style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee . " in other words , does daschle position the senate democrats for the bipartisan high road after this bill is passed or does he position democrats for the partisan wrangling that seems very likely all the way to conference committee later this month . looking forward to the final , conferenced bill : sorting through various proposals , sources suggest a possible solution agenda : rebate for bottom 34 million payroll taxpayers 30 % expensing for 12 months ( maybe compromise of 18 months ) five year net - loss carry back unemployment insurance extension and some expansion - - maybe through help directly to states ( more rep . governors may like that ) and some cobra assistance . repeal of corporate amt ( or several - year suspension ) as concessions to house republicans ( dems go along but say it will be a big mistake ) odds and ends from appropriators ( energy assistance , food assistance , etc ) all of this comes to around $ 100 billion . although the numbers have gravitated steadily northward , there is one major decision to be made that could add another $ 40 billion to the total ( bringing the final stimulus package to something like $ 120 - $ 140 b ) : more rebate checks both house and senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes ( that ' s the bottom 34 million ) . but it would be highly unlike this - or any - congress to pass stimulus legislation that helped the bottom 20 % and the top 2 % ( through major business tax cuts ) , but left the 75 % in the middle out of the equation entirely . one solution could be to send another rebate to everyone : another $ 38 b

if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes ? why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios . you talk about german technocracy , and you get automobiles . you talk about american technocracy , and you find men on the moon - not once , but several times - and safely home again . you talk about scandals , and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here . when the railways of france , germany and india were breaking down through age , it was the americans who rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an old caboose . both are still broke . i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble . can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake . our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around . they will come out of this thing with their flag high . and when they do , they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada is not one of those . " stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! ! this is one of the best editorials that i have ever read regarding the united states . it is nice that one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it . we are always blamed for everything , and never even get a thank you for the things we do . i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am just a single american that has read this , tribute to the united states                                                                   ? easy unsubscribe click here : http : / / topica . com / u / ? a 84 vnf . a 9 ivhm ? or send an email to : brcc . yf - unsubscribe @ topica . com ? this email was sent to : dfarmer @ enron . com ? ? t o p i c a - - register now to manage your mail ! ? http : / / www . topica . com / partner / tago 2 / register ?

2	Subject: update on confirmlogic i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . . testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were " show stoppers " as far as releasing the product for beta testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) . the team worked on the " fixes " and migrated the code last night . today during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we plan more testing in the morning . they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further . we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable . overall , we like the " new " streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues . call with any questions . kim theriot

2	Subject: still working on it but here ' s where we are first off , congratulations ! i hear you now have an adorable baby boy ( same weight as my 2 nd girl - 9 lbs / 1 oz . ? ) . that ' s really great louise . are you getting any sleep ? hate to hit you with business but someone said you ' re on email so i thought i ' d try . we ' re basically finished reviewing / tweaking the business models within ees and it ' s probably time to see if we can bring closure to the sic code split . i ' m forwarding you a couple of emails to help remind you where we were on this , but basically , we had general agreement on the sic code split , we just needed to agree on the volumetric delineation point for the ena sic codes . i had proposed 24 mw / 3000 mmbtu / d and below would fall to ees , you had proposed 10 mw / 1000 mmbtu / d and below . the majority of ees ' business will fall within the eastern interconnect , and my split had more to do with the fact that the ena originators / mid - marketers were focused on 25 mw and above . after the meetings we just went through with the ees sales groups , i would be surprised if many of our customer targets have sites > 20 mw ' s in the ena sic codes . i don ' t foresee any major issues if we lower the delineation point to 19 mw ' s . would love to get your views soon if possible . if you ' d like me to follow up with john l . since you ' re out , i can certainly do so . also , i ' ve met with the industrial market group ( ray bowen ) and we ' ve set up a coordination plan for eim / ees to lever the relationships that each organization currently has where the other group may have opportunities . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by janet r dietrich / hou / ees on 05 / 21 / 2001 09 : 06 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - david w delainey 03 / 24 / 2001 02 : 49 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect cc : john j lavorato / corp / enron , janet r dietrich / hou / ees @ ees subject : still working on it but here ' s where we are louise , i would like you to re - consider our original proposal for a few reasons . i have a lot of history on this one given i ' ve been on both sides of the fence and was the original creator of what ultimately became the eim group . as a result , i have been in many discussions with lou and jeff on these issues . in the original agreement between ees and ena the following sic codes were excluded from ees as part of the minority shareholder agreement in 1996 / 1997 : mining ( except oil and gas ) ; oil and gas extraction textile manufacturing paper manufacturing chemical manufacturing petroleum and coal products manufacturing plastics and rubber products manufacturing glass manufacturing primary metal manufacturing fabricated and metals products manufacturing machinery manufacturing rail transportation . all other sic codes fell within ees . in 2000 , with the buy - back of the minority shareholders , lou , jeff and i agreed to move several of the lower process load sic codes into ees including textile manufacturing ( like springs industries ) , glass manufacturing ( like owens corning ) , fabricated and metals product manufacturing ( like general cable and american national can ) and machinery manufacturing ( like lockheed martin ) . this was primarily because these customers tend to be of lower energy sophistication and consumption , numerous sites ( in deregulated and regulated environments ) and of small size . the ees value proposition fit these customers much better than wholesale . we have completed numerous significant term transactions and outsources in these industries ( see parenthesis for several ) . for the other sic codes , these remained in ena and eim . ees has no interest in paper mills , smelters , fertilizer manufacturers , refiners , etc . we neither have the products or pricing capability to manage or close very large process oriented consumers . however , there are divisions inside these companies that we have been able to have some success . for example , the speciality chemicals divisions of the large chemical companies tend to be significantly smaller loads and ignored from a capital , dsm and commodity point of view by the large purchasing agents . another example , is the gasoline retailing networks for the large oil and gas / refining companies which can be very small loads spread over thousands of sites . another example , is the specialty paper / container board divisions of the paper companies . in several of the large oil and gas and petrochemical companies we have found fertile ground in their office buildings and research centers . our proposal to limit ees ' s activities in the ena sic codes by consumption size was to give us some freedom to target these divisions inside these companies which ena would normally ignore . if there is a better way to split this out than by a size definition lets discuss . finally , given the more targeted and sophisticated sales process utilized in ees ( by necessity ) , it would be easier to coordinate between the companies based on a size sort where ees had limited access to ena ' s sic codes versus the opposite . on the surface your proposal looks reasonable ; however , it fails to sufficiently manage the issues . for example : - how would you manage a customer like wal - mart which may use more than 10 mw at a site but requires a national or regional solution for all 10 , 000 sites in both deregulated and regulated jurisdictions ; - how will we sufficiently manage the ena sales force which tends to over - cover and " under - product " for the vast majority of these industries and customers ie ) i think it would be a disaster for ees and ena ; - and ees has the relationship based selling capability and basic products to successfully manage these customers ( you could argue right now that is all we have ! ) . on a final note , i believe strongly that john and i should send out a note to both organizations clarifying these issues because : a ) it is way overdue - years in fact - it was always difficult when i was upstairs to get lou to cooperate ; b ) it is extremely destructive and un - productive for multiple enron groups to communicate and target the same customer ; c ) i don ' t believe that the employees ( on both side of the fence ) will honor the obligation unless it is expressly stated , openly communicated and enforced by the two management teams ; and d ) we need to be proactive , because " cleaning " it up after the dual call , etc significantly damages our credibility as enron with a number of these customers . it may be worthwhile in the same exercise to let you know what we may be doing in the the utility and generator markets in the interest of open communication and ensure your buy - in . i look forward to futher discussing this with you . our motivations are not to try and enter ena markets but to split the industrial and commercial segments between the two companies clearly which increases productivity and shareholder value . regards delainey - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by david w delainey / hou / ees on 03 / 24 / 2001 01 : 51 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - janet r dietrich 03 / 23 / 2001 05 : 28 pm to : david w delainey / hou / ees @ ees cc : subject : still working on it but here ' s where we are fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by janet r dietrich / hou / ees on 03 / 23 / 2001 05 : 28 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - louise kitchen @ ect 03 / 23 / 2001 05 : 27 pm to : janet r dietrich / hou / ees @ ees cc : subject : still working on it but here ' s where we are janet , tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon . i have removed the split from east to west . load power ena > 10 mw hourly peak demand ees 1 , 000 mmbtus / day ees < 1 , 000 mmbtus / day i am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value . louise

foot pekisko oi | formation at 7 , 320 feet . when driiling resumes , the hoie is pianned to reach a tota | depth of 7 , 570 feet , which may take some lo days to then complete drilling and testing . each deveiopment weil has probabie production of 150 barrels of oil per day and 750 ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 biilion cubic feet gas and 30 o , ooo barreis of oi | . there are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas . the average we | | in the sylvan lake field has produced 500 barreis of oi | per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas per day . if successful , the company intends to dril | up to 4 more welis on these land sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and natural gas over the past forty -

2	Subject: can you be sincere ? hang seng bank ltd . des voeux rd . branch , central hong kong , honk kong . dear sir , let me start by introducing myself . i am mr . wang qin credit officer of the hang seng bank ltd . i have a concealed business suggestion for you . before the u . s and iraqi war our client general . ibrahim moussa who was with the iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months , with a value of twenty millions five hundred thousand united state dollars only in my branch . upon maturity several notice was sent to him , even during the war early this year . again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him . we later find out that the general and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home . after further investigation it was also discovered that gen . ibrahim moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit . and he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank . so , twenty millions five hundred thousand united state dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it . what bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the funds . against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is thati will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to gen . ibrahim moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds . what is to be done : i want you to know that i have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful . i have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to gen . ibrahim moussa , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your full names and address so that the attorney can commence his job . after you have been made the next of kin , the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you . there is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents . please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue . once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70 % for me , 25 % for you and 5 % for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation . should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and i will provide you with more details of this operation . your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated . kind regards , mr . wang qin  ?     - http : / / www . hooraljenan . com

2	Subject: re : project doorstep responsibility matrix thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late . here they are anyway : 1 socrates i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have primary responsibility for this system / project . but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart . 2 exhaustive ? it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such . 3 symptoms or causes ? many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied . in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 : " prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionality . . . " because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they did . i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on microsoft excel all day , everyday . 4 overall i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate . as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control functionality ? dp brent a price @ ect 05 / 08 / 2000 11 : 08 am to : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , tani nath / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , james new / lon / ect @ ect , richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect , tim davies / lon / ect @ ect , rebecca millerchip / lon / ect @ ect , kevin sweeney / hou / ect @ ect , pablo pissanetzky / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , eric virro / lon / ect @ ect , richard sage / lon / ect @ ect , tim poullain - patterson / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect subject : project doorstep responsibility matrix attached is a responsibility matrix for london - project doorstep action steps . the listing consists of controls findings , action steps , proposed timelines , and proposed sponsors and responsibility assignments for the completion of the action steps . the purpose of this matrix will be to review and monitor it on an ongoing basis to ensure that items are being appropriately addressed and completed . please take a moment to review all sections of the listing and communicate any comments or revisions you may have to me as soon as possible . we would like to have a final version of this document in place by may 12 .

2	Subject: attn : mail from mr . carl huang . from the desk of : mr . carl s . m huang . hua nan commercial bank ltd . nan kang branch , taiwan republic of china i am sending you this letter based on information gathered about you . you will be surprise to receive this mail , because we have not met before or spoken on phone . i believe you will be in the position to help me in my bid to secure this urgent and very important help from you . on june 6 , 1999 , a british oil consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals corporation , mr . ray beck . made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty million dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the chinese solid minerals corporation that mr . ray beck died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . ray beck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to laws of republic of china , at the expiration of 5 ( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the chinese government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr . ray beck so that the fruits of this old man ' s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple , i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin . we shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer . a bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin . the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 80 % for me and 20 % for you . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the svp / gm guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication . also observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . thanks and regards . mr . carl s . m huang . message sent from www . foilconduit . com

2	Subject: re : houston research opportunity : anjam vince : here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for anjam actually entails . it seems to me that anjam ' s interest in getting an expat package is mostly about money . based on the uk hr ' s read of anjam , they think he will jump . i have a telephone conference with anjam at 11 : 00 . my stance will be 110 is firm . we will help with the transition via a one time settlement : flat rental issues , 500 lbs of air shipping for moving furniture , maybe one trip back to uk a year , but no more . re : his concerns of having a place in london should he want to return , i will say that vince would be far better at finding a good spot for you than any hr type , so that part of the " package " promise is not particularly important . any guidelines for me to follow , coach ? regards , grant . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by grant masson / hou / ect on 08 / 11 / 2000 08 : 44 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tara rozen 08 / 11 / 2000 05 : 44 am to : grant masson / hou / ect @ ect cc : melanie doyle / lon / ect @ ect , jane allen / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : houston research opportunity grant not sure if i told you that i work mon , wed , friday hence the delay in responding . sorry if i forgot to tell you ! another contact name in my absence who will be able to assist is jane allen in houston ( cc ' ed above ) . three main reasons we try to stay away from assignments to the us for this type / level of transfer are : 1 ) cost 2 ) equitability among other peers 3 ) difficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment package . however , if this is truly a 12 month assignment with no intention of extension , we would normally do the following : 12 month assignment london base , car allowance , and benefits and national insurance contribution costs ( currently 12 . 2 % of all comp compared with 1 . 45 % of all comp plus 6 . 2 % up to max of $ 76 k of employers us contribution ) housing costs in houston paid if maintaining housing in the uk ( usually up to $ 1800 per month for single ) utility costs if maintaining a house in the uk - up to $ 100 per month home leave - two economy trips per year is standard transportation to / from assignment - economy class transportation in houston - we normally give this - up to $ 40 per day for rental car in addition to the person ' s car allowance as they normally do not require a car in the uk and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas they will require a car in houston . shipment of goods - 500 lbs air tax assistance disturbance allowance - normally pay approx $ 1000 so , in terms of costs if you just compare a local us salary of manager on $ 100 k to a local uk manager on o 68 k the us total cost is approx $ 120 k . the uk cost is approx $ 230 k . then if you add the above costs to the assignment , you will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers , ie approx $ 280 k compared with $ 120 k . we do have the ability to change the above in any way as there is no set policy ; however , anjam has already brought up other people ' s assignments and i have a feeling he will do his best to find out what everyone else is receiving . if we make clear , though , that we are keeping on uk payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at which point a decision will need to be made ( returns or moves to local us ) , then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining more reasonable costs . not sure how you want to play this , though . even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally , there is still the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the 12 months . we will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot guarantee it . if he transfers to a local us contract , enron europe ' s responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil . i hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated . i honestly feel that ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an assignment basis . he made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on uk payroll for 12 months , he would not transfer . call me if you would like to discuss . tara - x 36763 enron capital & trade resources corp . from : grant masson 09 / 08 / 2000 20 : 48 to : tara rozen / lon / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : houston research opportunity tara : thanks for the update . it seems anjam is playing hard ball a little . my initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer , but on second thoughts , could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a 12 - month assignment when you have a moment ? compensation , benefits , responsibilities , career path implications , etc . many thanks ! regards , grant .

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( " gccc " ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the " act " ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words " plan , " " confident that , " " believe , " " scheduled , " " expect , " or " intend to , " and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2 oo 4 ! ! please watch this one trade tuesday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

2	Subject: more info on higher gas prices enron talking points . . . . factors leading to higher natural gas prices this winter ? demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming economy . ? natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since 1998 due to low prices that reached far below $ 2 per mmbtu . in 2000 , deliverability utilization will be over 95 percent . ? while drilling activity has risen sharply ( as much as 50 % from last year ) , the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not available for several months . according to the aga , supply production continues to run 16 % below last year ' s levels . ? the past three winters have been " warmer than normal " winters in the midwest and much of the united states and canada , artificially masking the usual consumption of natural gas under " normal " weather situations . ? very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices upward . ? u . s . storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from the past six years , according to the aga . the cost of storage inventory at this summer ' s strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally experienced in the winter . ? other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than last .

' s interests are represented by the law firm of blake , cassels & graydon . each member of industry canada has assigned to it a representative of the firm of blake , cassels & graydon , under the supervision of dalton mcgrath , who is a partner with his firm . you are not speak to or provide any such information to any of the representatives of industry canada except under the authority and direction of a representative of blake , cassels & graydon . in other words , you are to advise the representatives of industry canada that you need to seek the advice and instructions of counsel before speaking with them or providing any information . 2 . although it is business as usual , as is the case whenever we have any outside visitors in the office , it is important to maintain the confidentiality of your business and your information . in other words , the representatives of industry canada are here for a specified purpose and they should be treated no differently than any other third parties when you are discussing , negotiating or documenting transactions that do not concern them . 3 . it is enron canada corp . ' s intention to be cooperative and non - obstructive . at the same time , it is both appropriate and customary that we do not assist the representatives of industry canada in doing their jobs . in other words , they know what they are looking for , and it is appropriate and customary for us not to point them in any particular direction , which may be the right or wrong direction . again , documentation and information requests are to be handled directly through blake , cassels & graydon under the supervision of dalton mcgrath . 4 . if the representatives of industry canada take any information ( whether in physical , electronic or other form ) it is imperative that through a representative of blake , cassels peter keohane , for all legal matters ; and dalton mcgrath or one of his designated representatives of blake , cassels & graydon . i want to emphasize that enron canada corp . is doing all of the appropriate things to ensure that our rights and interests are protected , while being as cooperative as possible . i want to emphasize the enron canada corp . believes any claim made by or through industry canada is without merit , and the steps we have taken should only be viewed as prudent and not as any indication of any liability by enron canada corp . regards , peter

" these " industrial platform scaleups " are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials , automotive suppliers , capital goods , chemicals , plastics conversion , metal working , etc . the fund has two investments currently : mascotech is a merger of three fund companies . it is a leading global designer and supplier of high quality , low - cost metal formed components , assemblies and modules for the transportation industry . products include noise vibration and harshness products , transmission and transfer case components , engine components , wheel end and suspension components , axle driveline components . estimated revenues were $ 1 . 9 billion in 2001 . the company has 50 facilities in 11 countries . 9 , 500 employees . an agreement to purchase collins & aikman corporation was signed in january 2001 . c & a is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a leading supplier of automotive fabric , interior trim and convertible top systems with 2000 sales of $ 1 . 9 billion . the original dash in april 2000 predicated that " ena will receive the exclusive right to provide all energy - related products and services to each platform company owned by the fund . . . ena will submit a comprehensive , long - term , energy managment plan for each platform company . hip will be obligated to accept and implement the plan as long as the plan provides a cost benefit relative to the platform company ' s current practices after accounting for switching costs . the expected value of this business to ena is about $ 20 - 50 mm .

( this is a poster child for " patient " investment capital ) . i want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is that the obligation should be transferred to eim which i believe has assumed the charter of the ena group that formerly managed this investment . dick .

2	Subject: enron japan commercial support model sally i just want to summarize / clarify our discussions so far on the commercial support model for enron japan . my background : in europe the commercial support function was divided into a middle office ( mo ) and a back office ( bo ) part , with a european controller ( fearnley dyson ) responsible for both functions . for scandinavia , the only trading office in europe outside of london , i was responsible for both functions , as local office controller , reporting into barry pearce , who reported to fearnley . in japan i also have this local office controller function , as being responsible for mo / bo activities in this region . the mo would consist of the trading related functions : documentation ( capture & confirmation ) , risk management , settlement and trade accounting . the bo would consist of g & a ' s , salaries & wages , tax , management reporting , statutory reporting and vat . back office : i report directly to cassandra scultz ( vp & cao of enron apachi ) . as much as possible are to be outsourced to our sydney office ( heidi mason , who also reports to cassandra ) , but some work has to be done in tokyo . the reasons for this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the power point presentation enclosed below . for payments we use houston treasury , as they are the only ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems . middle office : mandate what i have in writing is a section from joe hirl ' s memo ( request for japan power trading positions ( draft ) ) to rick buy and greg whalley dated april 19 this year ( please find enclosed ) back office operations : jan erland bekeng in cooperation with sally beck will look to establish the local risk books in tokyo and define any system modifications necessary given the characteristics of the japanese electricity market . enron japan will handle trade capture and risk management while confirmations and settlements will occur in houston under sally beck  , s supervision . it support and system modification will be overseen by anthony dayao and performed in houston . discussion - current & future situation i see more commodities than power . metals will arrive september 25 , weather is on the way from sydney , and garry hickerson will from september 1 have a guy here doing irfx , agri and maybe equity . we are also looking into oil deals , and have plans for gas , coal , pulp & paper , credit and emissions . also ebs is on the way . i only see metals , irfx and weather as active desks this year , maybe oil . power will take some more time to get active , due to the very closed market situation here right now . on the origination side we might see some structures / cross commidity / finance deals go through . thus we have a mix of activites from enron apachi , enron global markets , ebs and enron metals . basically everyone wants to do some business in japan . to coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient , independent , segregated , automised and service minded japanese commercial support function possible . to accomplish these objectives , outsourcing to sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately , and is highly recommended from our side . labour costs in sydney is 25 % of the costs in tokyo . due to sydney ' s experience and size they are ready to expand and take on this project . they already have the segregation and independence in place , and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of being an intermideary between tokyo and houston . bilingual staff would be hired to perform japanese services , which is widely available in sydney . and there is only one hour in difference between us . outsourcing these activities from japan to australia is a growing trend , and many large corporations have done it this way . there will be some time from the first trades until functions and commodities are moved to sydney . tokyo want and needs to learn , understand all details , automise , make routines and calibrate systems first . on the confirmation side our legal department would be heavily involved in th start , compared to later stages . proposed mo structure for enron japan a ) responsibility for all commercial support activities in japan to be sourced to enron japan , under enron japan ' s cfo . b ) outsource programmable tasks to sydney : - documentation ( capture & confirmation ) - settlement - trade accounting c ) risk management in tokyo . i look forward to hear from you . regards jan - erland

( wes please sort out unless jim has any problems with the above methodology ) . thanks louise

2	Subject: company spotlight > > ( otc : sbgx ) here ' s another company to put on your radar , another one from the same source that alerted us to : cyad , tftg which all doubled . stonebridge resources exploration ltd . ( otc : sbgx . pk ) current price : $ 0 . 41 equity structure freetrading 20 , 000 , 000 sharesfloat 3 , 000 , 000 shares overviewstonebridge resources exploration ltd . ( nasd pink : sbgx ) , is a nevada corporation listed on the nasdaq pink sheets . the company is focused on resource acquisition and development for interests located primarily in canada and the united states . the company has begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals , gold and rare earth bearing properties . the company has a strategy to acquire a large number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing immediately . the initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for moving into production and produce substantial income and profits . a private funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial properties under friendly terms which involve a working interest in the properties and equity in the company . value resources has a highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource property development . the target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has a diverse and robust mix of deposits , some of very high value . one target acquisition , for example , has a large deposit of scandium . scandium is a very expensive rare earth material which has been used by the russian materials industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft . currently there is no scandium mined in the free world , and the property that stonebridge plans to develop contains large reserves of scandium and titanium . the company plans to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper , gold , zinc , talc , platinum and palladium amongst others . stonebridge has an initial plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties within a very short timeframe . in the next several months sbgx plans to control at least a dozen high - value mining properties with the potential to bring in many millions of dollars of profit to the company . the exact extent of the potential revenues is as yet undermined because , although most of the candidate properties have known reserves , more exploration and drilling needs to be conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once acquisition is complete . even after exploration , the potential exists to uncover undiscovered reserves with the potential to multiply the known value of the candidate acquisitions . one target acquisition is about 10 kilometers southwest of timmins , ontario . the property already has indicated probable reserves of 100 , 000 ounces with grades of 0 . 3 ounces per ton . this medium grade ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit . exploration is ongoing at the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for development once the acquisition is completed . the company has a strategy to develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests . this strategy allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly on all properties simultaneously . the company has at least ten gold bearing sites under review for acquisition at this time .  resources is building a large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in various stages of development . the strategy of developing diverse properties with various types of rare earth , gold and mineral deposits insures that there is robust and lasting value built into the company . moreover the chances of uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and extent of the deposits become fully known . stonebridge plans to develop these properties and get them into production as soon as possible . the company is well funded by investors who care for the long - term viability of the company and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders . gmcr expects that stonebridge will realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the development of these initial candidate properties . moreover , gmcr expects that the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major mining concern throughout north america . press release stonebridge signs loi to acquire 50 % interest in mining claims of 6070205 canada inc . friday april 29 , 4 : 01 pm et carson city , nev . - - ( business wire ) - - april 29 , 2005 - - stonebridge resources explorations ltd . ( nqb : sbgx - news ) , has entered into a letter of intent with 6070205 canada inc . to acquire 50 % interest in the mining claims of their property in northern ontario , 15 km n . w . of kirkland lake . the property was explored previously by a number of companies and previous drilling indicated geology finds that are favorable for a potential large sulphite deposit . the initial drilling done in 1998 indicated zinc mineralization in a number of drill holes , varying from 0 . 6 meters of 4 . 4 % zinc and 1 . 76 % zinc over 4 . 6 meters , 1 . 33 % zinc over 4 meters . in the year 2002 a megatem airborne survey was conducted over the property identifying several areas of interest . a confirmation of the geophysical result from the airborne survey was obtained by a ground geophysical survey that identified the down plunge extension of the previous drilling . it was recommended that a 3 drill hole program for a total of 500 meters be undertaken . harold pizel , stonebridge resources president , said ; " this agreement signed once again shows our strong belief and commitment to the mineral rich northern ontario region , we are excited about the opportunities ahead .

2	Subject: fw : extension of petro - canada wholesale gas services arrangement for 5 more years after a great deal of work the canadian team has renewed our outsourcing arrangement with petrocanada for another 5 years . this was a great accomplishment for enron canada . the logistics , accounting and commercial execution over the last 3 and 1 / 2 years played a key role in extending this deal . john - - - - - original message - - - - - from : milnthorp , rob sent : tuesday , march 27 , 2001 11 : 21 am to : lavorato , john subject : re : extension of petro - canada wholesale gas services arrangement for 5 more years john , as per our telecon , please see the attached for details . let me know if you require something further . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by rob milnthorp / cal / ect on 02 / 23 / 2001 05 : 11 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : eric ledain on 02 / 23 / 2001 09 : 11 am to : rob milnthorp / cal / ect @ ect cc : subject : extension of petro - canada wholesale gas services arrangement for 5 more years on wednesday the president of petro - canada approved the extension of our wholesale gas services agreement after the first term expires november 1 , 2002 , for an incremental 5 years . this has taken me a a while to get closed ( and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service ) , but keep in mind it ' s not easy to renew something half way through the first term . this extension is very significant for the following reasons : 1 . it creates a mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn , net of directly attributable costs to provide the back - office services ; 2 . it supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income ( along with all the production information etc . ) ; 3 . of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across canada . as you know , we have used the petro - canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide , not only when marketing in canada but also in the us and europe . now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years , but they ' ve liked it so much they ' ve already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service . obviously this is a great credit to our commercial staff and the operations , accounting and it staff that work with petro - canada . i will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them . it takes alot of effort to " enchant " the customer day after day , year after year . in fact it ' s incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider . the numbers : under the extension , we have provided petro - canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee . original base fee is $ 1 . 75 mm cdn per year , payable monthly . rebate offered : jan / 01 - nov / 01 ( $ 458 , 300 ) cdn nov / 01 - nov / 02 ( $ 517 , 000 ) cdn fee charged for extension term : nov / 02 - nov / 03 $ 1 , 366 , 000 cdn nov / 03 - nov / 04 $ 1 , 400 , 000 cdn nov / 04 - nov / 05 $ 1 , 435 , 000 cdn nov / 05 - nov / 06 $ 1 , 470 , 000 cdn nov / 06 - nov / 07 $ 1 , 510 , 000 cdn we have thoroughly defined our back - office costs required to provide these services at $ 428 , 700 cdn / yr ( 2000 $ ) , and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection ( with escalation at 2 % per year ) for the second five year term . these costs include back - office staff allocations ( salaries and benefits ) , and rent / infrastructure allocation . we have checked on the allocation of houston costs , and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels . we do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow . in discussions with wes , this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope , will allow us to mtm this income . the mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term , and has been reduced by the above annual costs . notes : 1 . we have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with pcog on what our benchmark should be , given that much of the intermediate producers in the group of 40 have disappeared . we will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to . 2 . if petro - canada ' s sales volumes fall to 60 % of last years levels , there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate . we also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140 % of today ' s levels . petro - canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected . volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7 - 8 % year on year . 3 . peter and i should have the amended agreement out next week .

" there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds " to repay the notes , mr . glisan said . " but if we are wrong , we will issue equity . " mr . glisan said a worst - case scenario would involve issuing as much as $ 1 billion in stock . enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding . making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron ' s share price . in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were down 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 . the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands . early this year , enron stock was more than $ 80 a share . during the past week , shares of the energy - trading giant have dropped more than 40 % . early last week , enron reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , resulting from $ 1 . 01 billion in write - offs . the company also disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s . fastow . in july , mr . fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors . on monday , enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr . fastow . enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper . the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while " we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well . " mr . lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs . mr . fastow , the chief financial officer , took part in the conference call . but neither he nor mr . lay would answer any questions concerning the fastow - related partnership , which was known as ljm 2 co - investment lp . mr . lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement , which has raised conflict - of - interest questions among analysts and others . mr . lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions . mr . lay said he was " very concerned about the way andy ' s character has been loosely tossed about . " he added " we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . " internal ljm 2 documents indicate that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership . billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljm 2 - related transactions , according to enron sec filings . during the conference call , analysts - - even some who have been longtime enron fans - - challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the company ' s often opaque financial reports . " there ' s the appearance you are hiding something , " said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer . " you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board . " mr . lay responded , " we ' re trying to be as transparent as we can .

' ' there is an appearance that you are hiding something , ' ' he said . after the call , mr . fleischer expressed disappointment . ' ' they ' ve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about , and that are hard to understand , ' ' he said in an interview . ' ' they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them ' ' as is needed , he said . but he said he was still recommending the stock . ' ' i don ' t think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans , ' ' he said . ' ' in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company , there is tremendous value here . ' ' mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr . fastow . but he emphasized that both he and the company ' s board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' mr . lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enron ' s reporting in conjunction with another off - balance - sheet vehicle , called marlin . that company owns one - third of azurix , an enron subsidiary that owns wessex , a british water utility . the auditors ' ' have determined there is no write - down required , ' ' he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management , a money management firm . mr . grubman said that marlin owed almost $ 1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake . noting that enron had paid about $ 300 million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write - downs on its investment in azurix , mr . grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt , which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares . mr . lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details . eventually he cut off mr . grubman . ' ' i know you ' re trying to drive the stock price down , and you ' ve done a pretty good job of it , ' ' mr . lay said . ' ' but let ' s move on to the next question . ' ' mr . fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $ 1 . 85 billion in such debt outstanding . he said it was backed by $ 3 . 35 billion in bank lines of credit , of which $ 1 . 75 billion will expire next may if it is not renewed . mr . lay said he was sorry about ' ' the misunderstanding ' ' that resulted when his brief mention of the $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts . that reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report , but it did not . he said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future , but made no promises . the large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings , and so was not in the earnings release . but it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement . the s . e . c . is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct . after one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as marlin , mr . lay said the company ' ' will look into providing ' ' such statements . copyright ?

" i , for one , find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions , " he said . lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the ljm partnerships because of the sec inquiry . he did say enron was aware an " inherent conflict of interest " would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with enron . in response , enron set up procedures , which lay said were rigorously followed , to ensure shareholder interests wouldn ' t be compromised . " there was a chinese wall between ljm and enron , " he said , adding that enron wasn ' t obligated to do deals with the ljm entities and did so when it was in enron ' s best interest . lay and enron ' s board continue to have the " highest faith and confidence " in fastow , he added . fastow resigned his roles with the ljm entities in june after criticism from wall street . enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships . it took a $ 35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as a result . during the call enron executives also addressed other issues . they stressed that enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles , whitewing and the atlantic water trust , that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or enron shares at the time of the investments . if enron should lose its current investment - grade quality debt rating , commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of enron ' s current outstanding shares to become diluted . jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons others found their lines dropped mid - stream ) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives . an analyst chided for his part in lowering the company ' s share price was told by ken lay , enron ' s chairman , that his question quota was up and it was time to move on .

" the issue is timing , " jarle sjo , shipping equity analyst at oslo - based investment bank first securities told reuters . " historically , lng projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term , " he added . the world fleet of lng tankers currently numbers 123 , but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004 , according to shipping database fairplay . gas industry analysts expect some lng projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn , excess capacity at existing plants in asia and a sharp fall in u . s . natural gas prices this year . svein erik amundsen , managing director of norwegian shipping group bergesen , said that a sustained economic downturn could have " consequences . " " i wouldn ' t be surprised by project delays , " he told reuters . " this could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment . " " i think you can say we ' re still optimistic , but more cautiously optimistic than before , " he added . bergesen has three new lng ships on order , two of which have already been contracted out to belgian gas distributor distrigas . stop and think the world ' s largest and only pure lng shipping player , golar lng , historically bullish in its outlook , has also been forced to stop and consider the problem . golar has six ships locked into long - term contracts , but four more are under construction at south korea ' s daewoo and hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment . " there is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered , " golar executive vp sveinung stohle told reuters , " the only risk is things might be delayed . " stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option , but it was also developing an lng trading arm , which might have a use for some of them . golar ' s closest competitor in terms of size , exmar , is taking a more traditional approach . it has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance . " we ' ve chartered out all of them except the samsung ship , which is under offer for the ( qatari ) rasgas tender , " managing director nicolas saverys told reuters . four are booked out to el paso and one to enron . he said that until all the upcoming projects had their supply production agreements in place , it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders .

" it ' s clear the house bill cannot pass the senate as it is , " said sen . john breaux , d - la . for individuals , the house legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn ' t get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002 , four years earlier than under the just - enacted tax cut . the measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers , enhances business equipment write - offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier . the primary sponsor , ways and means committee chairman bill thomas , said in a newspaper opinion piece published tuesday in usa today that the legislation " is a shot of adrenaline " that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation . " businesses generate jobs , and jobs are the core of a strong economy , " wrote thomas , r - calif . while bipartisan support backs some of the house items , senate democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance . sen . max baucus , chairman of the senate finance committee , presented a $ 70 billion proposal tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks , provide a 50 percent federal match for cobra health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for medicaid . the legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the house bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief . tax cuts in the baucus measure would total $ 35 billion in 2002 , far below the house gop level . " this proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times , helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly , " said baucus , d - mont . other democrats were working on spending programs . senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd , d - w . va . , said he was putting together a $ 20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors , augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines . sen . charles grassley , r - iowa , said president bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending .

2	Subject: ngi article on tw hearing ( after first day ) transwestern denies withheld capacity to boost negotiated deals a transwestern pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for california from its recourse - rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates . mary kay miller , vice president of rates and certificates , acknowledged transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes ( prior to posting its available capacity ) with two shippers - - sempra energy and richardson products ii ltd . - - that subsequently entered into negotiated - rate transactions . but she stressed that requests for capacity by sempra energy and richardson were considered " moot " by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted . " even if they would have sent . . . a fax the day before " capacity became available , " it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted " at that time , said miller . capacity requests that came in prior to jan . 31 , the day that available capacity was posted for february contracts on transwestern , were " null and void . " the only " relevant " ones were those that transwestern received on or after jan . 31 , she noted . miller spent much of wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for ferc and producers about transwestern ' s methods for notifying customers about available capacity , the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre - posting contacts with sempra energy and richardson . it was the first day of a ferc hearing exploring charges that transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated - rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $ 27 / mmbtu last february , far in excess of the pipeline ' s maximum allowed rate of 38 cents / mmbtu for firm transportation service to the california border . the commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated - rate contracts of sempra energy and richardson for a total 45 , 000 mmbtu / d of service on transwestern during february and march . richardson and sempra " clearly did not have any ' deal ' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted , " miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony . the two companies " had the right to the capacity only ' after ' they submitted their bids , ' after ' the posting period ended , ' after ' transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted , and ' after ' a contract was agreed upon between transwestern , richardson or sempra , " she noted . despite claims made by ferc energy industry analyst barry e . sullivan to the contrary , " transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates , " miller testified . sullivan , an analyst in the ferc office of markets , tariffs and rates ' ( omtr ) division of litigation , contends that transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates . in fact , he believes the pre - posting discussions between transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate , so that shippers might be more " willing to enter into negotiated - rate contracts above the recourse rate , in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [ it became ] available . " but miller counters that sullivan " offers not support for his claim . " she noted that even sempra energy and richardson , in response to a data request by southern california edison , support transwestern ' s claims . both companies replied " no " when asked whether " any employee of transwestern or any transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate . " the " capacity at issue was offered on transwestern ' s web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on transwestern ' s web site at the recourse rate ; there was no prohibition , restrictions , limitation , condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate ; and any potential shipper , including richardson or sempra , could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate . " sullivan contends that transwestern ' s motive for allegedly advancing negotiated - rate transactions at the expense of recourse - rate deals was pure profit . under questioning by thomas j . burgess of ferc ' s omtr , miller conceded that transwestern earned $ 1 . 8 million from sempra energy ' s contract in march , $ 1 . 3 million from richardson ' s march contract , and a " comparable " amount from richardson ' s february contract . she noted the pipeline received a " substantially higher " amount as a result of sempra ' s february contract , but she didn ' t provide an exact figure . ferc ' s sullivan estimated the pipeline ' s profit from the sempra february contract was more than $ 5 million . sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in transwestern ' s coffers would have gone to sempra energy and richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates . but miller countered that the commission ' s negotiated - rate policy " does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits . " furthermore , she said the transwestern case shouldn ' t be used to consider changes to the negotiated - rate policy , as sullivan has suggested . this case " is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated - rate policy should only be done on an industry - wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged .

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

2	Subject: lme turnovers fall , long - established trend halted - reuters ( eol mention ) uk : lme turnovers fall , long - established trend halted . 07 / 03 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , july 3 ( reuters ) - first - half volumes on the london metal exchange ( lme ) fell nearly 16 percent from year - ago levels amid signs that years of rising turnover on the world ' s largest non - ferrous metals market may be coming to an end . traders said this year had seen volumes affected by the general downturn in global economies , weakening prices and the knock - on impact of electronic screen trading . " the problem is the general conditions that are prevailing at the moment - we are seeing recessionary signs that are dampening the market . it is cyclical , and that is the worry because the cycle is lasting some time , " one said . figures released on tuesday by the lme showed that total futures and options turnover during jan / june 2001 fell to 29 . 899 million lots , down from a jan / june 2000 level of 35 . 440 million . traded options turnovers were significantly lower , falling to 1 . 481 million lots from 2 . 784 million as reduced volatility deterred options interest . although the lme derives much of its liquidity from speculators , the bulk of its trade comes from the metals industry - hedging and price protection . " there is consumer and producer business around , but they are very selective at the moment , " another trader said . whether the trend continued throughout the year amd marked a sea - change after some 10 years of almost uninterrupted volume growth may depend on market conditions improving . most of this year has seen prices progressively weaker , with copper recently at its lowest since july 1999 , zinc and tin at levels last seen nearly eight years ago , lead at a 12 - month low - point and nickel and aluminium at two - month lows . although prices have been softer , there have been occasions when tightness has prevailed in some markets , lifting spot premiums , but these do not generate trades . " these squeezes that have taken place this year in copper , aluminium and tin in particular have not helped , " the second trader said . when the market moves from contango , when nearby prices are cheaper than forward , into backwardation , which is the opposite , hedging dries up . the last year has also seen electronic trading take off , with competitors such as enron online and spectron metals grabbing business . the lme has also sanctioned and launched its own system - known as lme select . these still trade lme contracts , so the turnovers are not directly hit , but screen - trading itself may be a factor . " in some ways the screens , whoever they belong to , may be the problem , " one said . " in the old days , you used to talk to people more , get a feel for the market , and take a punt . not so much now - the big boys still chat , but not as much , and with the screens it is almost a ' matched bargain ' situation , " he said . folder name : enron reuters folder relevance score on scale of 100 : 83 to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

" i can work to pay for my meals , " he ' d tell anyone who would listen . my dad was stricken with alzheimer ' s but the character built in him through the toughest of times remained with him forever . we baby - boomers have been blessed in the sense that we will never truly know the gut wrenching sacrifice that spurned our ancestors to live passionately in times of pitifully dire straits at a time when the whole of america was the underdog that would rise up once again to beat the odds - - true champions of spirit . sitting in the darkened theater tears couldn ' t help but fall . in a sense , the movie brought me to the realization that , like jim braddock , the heroes of america back then were the fathers waiting in mile long work lines to put food on the table to feed starving children . this was father ' s day . i thought about my father and his father before him , with loving humbleness and quiet respect for enduring what i will never face . my memory lingered on the man who gave me life , who often times went to bed hungry , with nothing more than the clothes on his back . he grew up to work hard to provide for his family the privileges he had never known . a really touching movie , i left the theater thankful for all the cinderella men of the depression era - - heroes who rose to the challenge to give their families all the best they could . truly america ' s inspiration in extremely difficult times . - - kathy whirity kathy lives in chicago where she shares her life and love with her husband of 28 years , bill , their two daughters jaime and katie , and two rambunctious retrievers holly and hannah . kathy is a newspaper columnist who writes sentimental musings on family life . you can reach her by clicking here : mailto : kathywhirity @ yahoo . com basket case by vickie baker when your day ' s in a hand - basket heading downhill and your heart is beginning to race , your stomach is threatening mutiny your headache is off the charts , your mailbox is bulging with overdue bills and catalogs - - wastebasket style - - your cat ' s tossed her cookies all over your bed your dog tossed his on the floor , the goldfish all died , the toilet won ' t flush and the parakeet flew the coop , the temperature ' s soaring , ash clogs the air and your lungs are bent out of shape , the shower won ' t work , your attitude stinks and you feel like a basket case , silence the critic inside your head . become a kid again ! ! ! blow bubbles and run through the sprinkler . walk backwards around the block . give yourself a standing ovation . clap long and loud and hard . place a colander on your head then stand by the window and wave . have a picnic lunch in your bathtub . eat purple popsicles a - la - nude . drink from the hose and throw water balloons . ring someone ' s doorbell ' n run . leave a joke on somebody ' s voice mail - anonymously , of course . write an uplifting letter just for yourself . send it off quick ! don ' t chicken out ! put a mark on yourself where you ' ve had it up to . pick up your bath towel and throw it in . give yourself a pat on the back you ' re a basket case no more . - - vickie baker vickie baker and her cat live independently with the help of a daily attendant in denver , colorado . do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

2	Subject: california update 4 / 20 / 01 executive summary ? davis struggles to find senate support for socal transmission deal ? only chance of deal going through is a one - time quick vote ; if deal has to go to hearings - it will probably die ? if not transmission deal , legislators will seize assets and seek price caps ? asset seizure would target power contracts , then power plants ; as a result the endless court battles will ensue , but this gives davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers ? bankruptcy for socal is still the most likely scenario , with the qfs or socal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended ? congressional democrats rally around davis and seize opportunity to blame the administration transmission deal and democratic support as governor gray davis scrambles to build support for his socal ed . transmission proposal , one thing is evident ; the longer the deal is exposed to public debate , the less likely it is to pass . in fact , politicians have been so leery of the deal that davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the senate . in the eyes of many democratic legislators ( and all republicans ) forcing socal edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines ; that is why the governor ' s senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick " up or down " vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week . the bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debate , however , if there is an opening within the next two weeks and davis feels he has enough support , it will be pushed through . because the socal deal needs every piece in place as " negotiated " by davis ' team , the team wants no amendments allowed on the assembly floor and a quick vote . if this unlikely fast track strategy fails for davis , the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily ( keep in mind that that it cannot even be resubmitted to the assembly until it has been vetted by socal edison attorneys ) . according to sources , the legislature is going to try to modify the memorandum of understanding between gov . davis and sce . however , the senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified mou . burton reportedly believes that at least 6 democrats will vote against it along with the republicans . the more that bill gets picked apart in public , the uglier it looks and the more democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it . another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of socal and not the state . among other things , the state is overpaying by about $ 1 . 5 billion for the transmission lines . additionally , the mou davis has with socal . ed nearly matches , point for point , the deal davis condemned with pg & e . asset seizures since before the pg & e bankruptcy filing , we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly frustrated democrats . davis ' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across california to existing power contracts negotiated by , whom davis ' s calls , " profiteering power brokers " . of course , everyone in the governor ' s office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts , and would be a legal nightmare ( there are a few minor constitutional , legal and interstate commerce problems ) . the main thing is that the seizing would continue davis ' s main approach to this problem - - management by press conference - - and it would put the governor and democrats on the right side of the issue - - punishing the capitalist leeches . according to one senior democratic legislator , there is movement within democratic members of the state assembly to demand that davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase . of course , taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants . the appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put california state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce mark - ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spot - market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof . price caps one strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three republican governors from colorado , alaska and wyoming . these three were the key players during the portland western governor ' s conference last january and , according to senior white house officials , it took the personal and prolonged intervention of president bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors . " if they had signed that price cap appeal , " the administration source said , " we would already have price caps . so if they start to make it clear something has changed , we will have to listen . " sources indicate that if these republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps , the bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the west . cost plus caps - - think of these as republican price caps in that their first duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid . just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal , current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like $ 250 per kilowatt hour . that is a long way down from the august futures contract that is pricing in $ 750 per kilowatt hour , but a long way above last august ' s $ 150 / kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power , which is something like $ 25 - 30 / kwh . market - price exceptions - - the option allows the bush administration to have political credit for imposing price caps . as we write , ferc is currently , in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in california ( duke , dynegy , aes , reliant and williams ) . the permit grants a further three - year waiver that allows them to sell power into california in the existing " whatever price the market will bear " . in other words , ferc could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price , perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share , and then power to control prices would revert back to ferc . technically , in granting the extension of these permits , ferc has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield " market power " - - that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times . of course , ferc has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes . but that would mean ferc would have to want to wield effective power over price capping in california and they have shown no desire on that front . the escape clause for ferc simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than 20 % of an electricity market and none of these companies come close . in other words , the waivers option lets ferc escape if the bush administration and ferc commissioners really want to escape . once again , that decision may be more in the hands of the three republican governors than anywhere else in the country . but you can be certain that in the past few days administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants . democrats seize opportunity to blame bush senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as $ 60 billion , which would destroy state finances for a decade . add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out - of - pocket electricity costs ( they paid $ 7 billion for electricity in 1999 , $ 27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay $ 70 billion this year - - ten times the rate two years ago . then , of course , they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way , and , well , who can blame the democrats for saying there is a simple solution , but the white house won ' t allow it . national level democrats realize california ' s power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the bush administration and its free - market advocate , ferc chairman hebert , over their resistance to summer price caps . as california ' s leaders calculate this year ' s taxpayer energy bill at potentially $ 60 billion , a rogue ' s gallery of democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with governor davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message : " the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in washington dc , at ferc headquarters controlled by bush administration appointees . " and as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the us congress comes more into focus , the solutions articulated by california ' s democrats who sense they have republicans on the run in the west become less and less " free market " focused . the two strains of the democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps .

' s shares have fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest energy trader ' s dealings with partnerships run by its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses . enron ' s stock dropped 10 percent today . enron ' s board cost the company at least $ 35 million by allowing chief financial officer andrew fastow to manage ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , partnerships that bought enron assets , a shareholder alleged wednesday in a lawsuit . the lawsuit came the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . the wall street journal reported $ 35 million of the losses were connected with the two limited partnerships . enron also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the partnerships , the paper reported yesterday . ` ` it looks sleazy , ' ' said roger hamilton , a manager at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . ` ` if you are someone who invests in a company ' s management , it ' s almost time to punt with enron . ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls or written requests seeking comment . fastow didn ' t immediately return a telephone call for comment . fastow and a handful of associates made more than $ 7 million last year in management fees and about $ 4 million in capital increases on an investment of about $ 3 million in one of the partnerships , the journal reported today . buying enron assets fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and partnerships that appear to have ties to houston - based enron , based on filings with the texas secretary of state . the foreign business corporations and limited liability companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron ' s corporate address , according to texas records . fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron assets , including foreign power plants . whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last year . under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other ` ` permitted investments . ' ' whitewing has bought 14 enron plants or companies since 1999 and sold four . enron ' s denne has not responded to written requests about fastow ' s role at whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the value of enron assets to benefit outside investors or company executives at enron ' s expense . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 95 to $ 26 . 05 . they have fallen 69 percent this year . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom , 609 - 750 - 4651 or rhubbard 2 @ bloomberg . net , and jim kennett in houston , ( 713 ) 353 - 4871 or jkennett @ bloomberg . net / pjm / alp / pjm usa : update 1 - enron stock sustains further heavy losses . 10 / 19 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . " i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , " said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . " i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , " he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . " for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , " said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . " it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , " he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . " what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? " asked one frustrated analyst .

" good people can always be placed . as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire , " sarah gilley of london - based recruitment group exchange consulting said . " where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets , people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies . " last week , scotiamocatta , a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member , unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor , prompting around 25 job losses among traders , phone jockeys and clerks . then blue - blooded banker n . m . rothschild & sons closed its london and new york base metals units . it left its core precious metals business intact , but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process . in the same week , the lme ' s largest floor trader , enron metals , said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the enron group . security with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time , competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security . " what we ' re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record , which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they ' re keen to stay put , " gilley said . " so whereas someone who might be a big money - spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years , they are now staying for three to five years . " they probably feel that they ' re reasonably safe where they are , they ' re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out , " she said . bonus fears october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences also , traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance - linked bonuses , which are usually announced at the end of the year . " those who are in work at the moment are sticking . often at this time of year , people are hanging on for their bonuses . but i don ' t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses . they ' re probably just happy to have a job , " sian griffiths of exchange consulting said . lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi - tech and telecomms stocks . metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients , and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market . companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal . " a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re - aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it , " gilley said . " the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing , " she added . as for morale in the industry , individuals ' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed .
