2	Subject: yesterday ' s profile up 56 % ( otcbb : isyn ) urgent news alert ! news alert stock profile press release asp industry what is an application service provider ( asp ) an application service provider ( asp ) is a company that offers individuals or groups access over the internet to software applications and related services that would otherwise have to be located in their own personal or enterprise computers . asp services are expected to become an important alternative , not only for smaller companies with low budgets for information technology , but also for larger companies as a form of outsourcing and for many services for individuals as well . early applications include : remote access serving for the users of an enterprise an off - premises local area network to which mobile users can be connected , with a common file server specialized applications that would be expensive to install and maintain within your own company or on your own computer while asps are forecast to provide applications and services to small enterprises and individuals on a pay - per - use or yearly license basis , larger corporations are essentially providing their own asp service in - house , moving applications off personal computers and putting them on a special kind of application server that is designed to handle the stripped - down kind of thin client workstation . this allows an enterprise to reassert the central control over application cost and usage that corporations formerly had in the period prior to the advent of the pc . microsoft ' s terminal server product and citrix ' s winframe products are leading thin - client application server products . msp industry what is an msp ? the managed service provider ( msp ) phenomenon is between 18 and 24 months old and is attracting a lot of attention from potential users and service providers wanting to add value . but different providers define it different ways , and service offerings range from the very limited to the very broad . a managed service provider delivers aspects of outsourced it operations , usually via an ip network . all msps remotely manage network infrastructure on an ongoing basis , while some extend their offerings to provide and manage application infrastructure . note : some msps refer to themselves as ' management service providers . three main types of msp in today ' s market , three main types of msp can be distinguished . they differ in terms of : the range of services offered the amount of responsibility they take for a client ' s business scope - that is , the size of the msp and the size of their target customer the low level - pure - play msps this group of msps describe themselves as ' management service providers ' , not ' managed service providers ' . many of the members of the year - old msp association fall into this category . the defining principle here is that these msps assist client companies in managing network infrastructure and limit themselves primarily to monitoring the performance of the network and of applications running over the network . they deliver services remotely via an ip network , sometimes by gathering data from a client ' s site via a networked server placed on site . range of services watching uptime , performance and availability are the central value propositions of this type of msp , although many in this category are expanding into extended infrastructure services , such as security , storage and testing . level of responsibility this type of msp takes little , if any , responsibility for a client ' s business . if it offers a service - level agreement , it is likely to be for the uptime of its own monitoring process , not for the client ' s website . its activities might be limited to reporting and alerts if a website experiences problems , or might extend to generating and tracking problem reports . if it extends its offerings to include security and storage , its responsibility level may increase accordingly . scope msps at this level tend to be small ( 50 - 300 employees ) . their clients will be smes with it departments that are either understaffed , taken up with major projects , or focused on non - infrastructure core competencies . clients tend to engage a low - level msp for one aspect of infrastructure monitoring ; if the relationship develops satisfactorily , they will then add additional services over time . this level of msp is attempting to make msp work as a business model , which will have short - term success at best . the mid - level - msp as a value - added service mid - level msps tend to describe themselves as ' managed service providers ' and to offer a broader range of services that take greater responsibility for a client ' s business . range of services these msps may move beyond performance monitoring and reporting to software patches , installation and upgrades , and application infrastructure provision , which require them to be proficient in web application servers . an msp at this level will take pride in offering as wide a range of services as possible , seeing this as a differentiator . level of responsibility mid - level msps also differentiate themselves by assuming greater responsibility for the functioning of a client ' s business . if a site goes down , they will do more than notification - they will work with the client to restore function . service - level agreements reflect this level of responsibility . scope msps at this level can be large , as managed service will be folded in to other service offerings , such as web hosting or network provision . they target the fortune 500 or 1 , 000 enterprise as a customer , although many also serve medium - sized clicks - and - mortar companies . web - hosting providers such as digex offer msp at this level as a value - added service to their core service provision , which is hosting websites . major telcos such as cable wireless and france telecom ( via equant and global one ) offer msp as well . loudcloud is probably the best - known example of a pure - play msp that has grown its business successfully in past years , although it is currently struggling to make the concept work in an inhospitable economy . the high level - outsourcing it operations these msps undertake to allow clients to outsource their entire it operation , if desired - truly one - stop shopping . they can also provide lower levels of service , like a mid - level msp . range of services msps at this level offer a full range of traditional managed service and add aspects of application handling , such as integration and even application hosting , which can be defined as ' one - to - one remote custom outsourcing of applications . level of responsibility service - level agreements in this segment will be customized to reflect differing levels of responsibility available to clients , depending on how much they want and are willing to pay . this type of msp can be the mythical xsp that shapes the technological identity of the client , choosing its hardware , storage , level of security and packaged application suites . scope small and large providers co - exist in this space , serving different constituencies . systems integrators and consultancies play here . boutique shops serve smes , and large providers such as eds , ibm global services and pricewaterhouse coopers serve large multinational corporations and , increasingly , medium -

2	Subject: global standard on valuation methodology changes and model approval sally / beth , as we discussed when i was in houston i have put together a draft on valuation methodology changes and model approval . i had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with ted murphy and tani nath ( she heads up research and structuring here in london ) but ted cancelled at the last minute ( again ) . tani and i met and are broadly in agreement , but before we can go any further we need ted ' s input . he is now away for 2 1 / 2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front . in the mean time i would appreciate your comments on what i have put together . i would prefer it if it is not circulated around houston at this stage until i can accurately say that ted is happy from a global rac perspective . likewise i still need to get houston research comfortable but i am going to wait until ted has had a chance to add his feedback so i can at least say that it is only houston research that is outstanding . others will also need to be consulted ( and i would like to agree a list of key people with you ) but i can ' t see their being any real contention . can you ? i am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in houston ( and it may well be here too ) and this has been added to the outstanding list . i am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation if there are any questions or feedback please let me know . james

2	Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly " unwilling to fight " for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would " double dip " into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would " eat " the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .

" in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a " new - hire " to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion .

" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , " said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . " there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . " as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow " will be on a leave of absence from the company . " he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that " management does care " about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as " an admission of guilt . " ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible " death spiral " in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with " trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , " he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street . ' ' but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way . ' ' people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you ' ll never get any answers .

" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a " chinese wall " existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an " informal inquiry " into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a " hold " to a " sell " rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a " sell " recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price . " we are concerned about what we don ' t know , " ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

" it could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if enron removed the cfo at the request of the sec , " prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said wednesday . " who knows ? " enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant ' s stocks have declined in value each day since monday ' s announcement that the sec had inquired about partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by fastow . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " enron chief executive officer kenneth lay said after markets closed wednesday . fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while jeff mcmahon , who has served as chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , takes over his role . " i think change is good at this particular point in time , " said fac equities analyst robert christensen said . " i think andy was somewhat beleaguered . " a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships . " i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements , " heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added . " there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , " heim said . " instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever . " enron ' s stock continued to plummet wednesday , closing down $ 3 . 38 to $ 16 . 41 per share , a 17 percent decline . since the wall street journal first reported on the partnerships last week , enron ' s stock price has slid nearly 52 percent . " the market was asking for that to happen , " j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said of fastow ' s departure . " this is really the first time enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis . " previously , enron ' s managers have been " cautious and defensive in their approach , " he said . during a conference call tuesday to address investor concern , lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as fastow carried out the dual roles . the partnerships have since been dissolved . the call didn ' t work for many , including feygin and heim . " i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , " heim said . " what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed . " the turbulent past few months which have included the sec inquiry , third quarter losses and the august resignation of the company ' s chief executive officer , jeff skilling , have left many analysts questioning the company ' s future , heim said . " it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , " he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . " internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , " feygin said . " three days ago i would have said there is no need for a change at the cfo level . today , it was pretty obvious it was something enron needed to do .

" investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to andy , " said j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin , who downgraded enron to " long - term buy " and owns no shares . fastow , 39 , ran ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , two partnerships created by enron to buy company assets . enron ' s involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $ 35 million in third - quarter losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from ljm 2 at a cost of $ 1 . 2 billion to unwind its investment . during a conference call tuesday , lay said , " i and enron ' s board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy and think he ' s doing an outstanding job as cfo .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the " fastow era " is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

" determined to keep the gulls at bay , i tied several brown paper bags to the clothes line in strategic locations . but still the smallest , driest fish continued to disappear . one afternoon , my tomboy intuition told me to check on my fish for thieving gulls . there stood the " gull " - - jackknife in hand , peeling the skin off the driest of the fish . " i ' m inspecting these to see if you salted them correctly , " he informed me as if he were an fda agent . in my eyes , no matter what my brother did was fine by me . no matter what he told me , i swallowed his every word - - hook , line and sinker . you could say i was the gull - ible one . and i still am , where my brother is concerned . he is loved as much today as he was in years gone by , maybe even more , for adding such colorful memories to my life . - - kay seefeldt kay lives in maine and enjoys writing stories about her family , many of which have been published on several on - line ezines . she hopes to compile these stories into a book for her children and grandchildren . this story was a gift of words to her brother who celebrated his birthday on june 7 . by the way , " blowing the fish " means the flies were laying eggs in them . do you enjoy heartwarmers ? maybe your friends would too . they can join for free by sending an email to : join @ heartwarmers . com from our mailbag ( in response to our last story , 10 , 000 years . . . ) dear heartwarmers : thank you , diane for sharing your lovely story with us . what a privilege to know and to be related to such a wonderful man !

diane ' s story about her grandfather - in - law filled my eyes with tears and my heart with amazing grace . who can resist that simple song that is loved and sung by people of all faiths . it was the comfort after september 11 th , and it is the world ' s most treasured hymn . it has given me hope when i felt hopeless , and it always reminds me that this life is but for a moment - - that the only thing we will ever take with us when we leave this planet , is what we ' ve given away . in 10 , 000 years the things we count as riches today will have given way to what we have done for others . well said , diane , and a fitting tribute for a true man of god . - - jaye lewis thank you , heartwarmer angels !

2	Subject: interesting article from motley fool ceo departure puzzles enron investors when enron ' s president and ceo suddenly and unexpectedly announced he was leaving the company earlier this week , the stock got hammered due to the increased uncertainty . the exact reasons for the departure are puzzling and remain a mystery , and this is probably not the last chapter we ' ll hear in this story . by paul larson ( tmf parlay ) august 17 , 2001 the plot around enron ( nyse : ene ) has thickened . on tuesday evening , the commodities market maker ' s president and ceo , jeffrey skilling , said that he was leaving his posts for " personal reasons . " skilling had spent most of his career rising through the ranks at enron and had manned the ceo post since february . many saw skilling as quite brash , sharp , egotistical , and one who brought more than his fair share of youthful energy to the " new - age " enron . but now that skilling has resigned , chairman kenneth lay - - the man skilling took the reins from - - will again act as president and ceo until a permanent replacement is found . lay was enron ' s ceo from 1985 until earlier this year , and he was largely behind the company ' s push to become the wholesale trading powerhouse it is today after years as a sleepy gas line operator . ( for more on the energy industry , see our latest issue of the motley fool select . ) so why did skilling bail ? the first reason skilling cited for his departure was the very vague " personal reasons . " both the company and skilling denied the resignation was for health reasons of any kind , and the secrecy and resultant uncertainty has sent the stock diving , losing roughly $ 6 ( or about 14 % ) of market value on extremely heavy volume in the two trading days since the announcement was made . the move is especially puzzling since the departure is hitting skilling in the pocketbook - - hard . since skilling is leaving voluntarily , he will not receive a severance package that would have reportedly been worth more than $ 20 million in cash and stock had he been forcefully pushed out . even if skilling had been doing a terrible job at enron , one would think he would stick around and wait for the axe to fall instead of leaving on his own , given that potential windfall . the departure is even more riddling when one considers a roughly $ 2 million loan outstanding that enron has to skilling . if skilling had been canned , this loan would have been forgiven . more importantly , if skilling had fulfilled his employment contract to the end of the year - - a mere four more months - - skilling could have kept this $ 2 million free and clear . how many folks do you know who pass up $ 2 million for four months of work ? yet another oddity in this case is the wall street journal ' s report that one of the reasons skilling left was because of enron ' s faltering share price . ironically , the fashion in which he has left has been directly responsible for causing the shares to breach a new annual low . many long - time enron investors may remember when skilling brashly called enron ' s shares undervalued back in january , saying the stock should trade above $ 120 . but since skilling took the helm , the stock has done nothing but fall , losing over half its value in the past six months . even though much of the stock ' s weakness had nothing to do with the company ' s operating performance , the pressure of not living up to that bullish projection was supposedly very difficult for skilling . still , the exact reasons for the sudden departure remain a mystery today . both skilling and the company deny there were any accounting problems or other improprieties behind the resignation , and both continue to speak quite positively about enron . but for a company that has a reputation of strong management , this week ' s activities are highly out of character . investors may be unsatisfied with the current state of affairs and information , but for the time being there ' s little to do but stay tuned .

2	Subject: re : hiring practices for summer interns sally , thanks for the e - mail regarding summer interns . i apologize that lexi and shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking . i wish that you had contacted either celeste or me to indicate that you were having difficulty . i have personally assured you on several occasions that i was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive . that being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it . you are absolutely correct . it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge . as you are aware , over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm ( brecker & merryman ) who has assisted us in a number of different market research projects . however , in my opinion , this issue is not one that required much research . i have been involved in recruiting in some way , shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10 years . most major organizations , with the exception of the accounting firms , begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring . there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date , particularly in the mba programs . for example , harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until january . as indicated , the firms that generally recruit in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for " spring " internships . the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns . presentations were made in january however , because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently . as you are aware , in most instances , the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early august . if you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts . i hope this has been helpful . i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager . again , i offer that i am available and willing to work with you if you are having difficulty with members of the program staff . please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance . charlene

2	Subject: a & a math majors vince , thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research group . after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst & associate program that might be of interest to you . during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates by limiting their recruitment effort . at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors . i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them , it would be considered . i searched for " mathematics " on the enron job website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed . thanks , heather johnson x 53240

2	Subject: joe mccauley ' s papers vince , as promised , these are a couple of references that i have for joe mccauley ' s papers . whether the specific papers are of interest to what exactly we ' re doing or not , i cannot say . on the other hand , given uh ' s drive to create an " econophysics " specialization within the physics department , i thought we could both help them * and * drive it towards a direction that it could be of use to us . i think that they would very much like to hear what the industry would like to see from such a specialization . some of the things that have been discussed as course offerings would be : basic physics courses ( mechanics , nonlinear dynamics , stat . physics , math methods ) various finance courses like options , banking , etc . statistics , math methods , and statistical physics ( that could teach topics like brownian motion , lognormal distributions , fractals , levy flights , and statistics of ' large deviations ' , which are of interest comp science ( java , c + + , data structures , algorithms ) monte carlo simulations etc setting up some sort of exchange , where at minimum we could get summer interns from this program , would also be beneficial to both sides . even better , a wider collaboration between enron and the physics department could be set up . after this message , i will inform joe mccauley and larry pinsky ( departmental chair person ) of your suggestions on how to proceed . i will send shirley their contact information to arrange for a visit at the beginning of june . thanks , yannis

2	Subject: var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince

2	Subject: friday brown bag on derivative pricing dear everyone , we understand the as members of enron research group , all of us are working on very interesting projects , some of which are ground - breaking , and we all keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology . we also find out , through our own experience , that at this age of information explosion , it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department , let alone in the industry . it is also our personal experience that many a project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of this group . as a remedy , we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag lunch group meeting , once every two weeks on friday , for about 50 minutes . it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new technology and development , as well as with each other  , s work , so that we do not have to reinvent the wheels . we envision the following : in this meeting ( or seminar ) , each one of us will take turns to make presentations to the group . the topics could range from theoretical consideration to practical implementation , be it option pricing , process modelling , insurance issue , or monte carlo simulation , or anything one finds fascinating . the presentation material could be papers you have been reading recently , projects you are working on , some problem that bothers you , or an idea that is fascinating . you choose your own presentation style . it could be everything - you - always - wanted - to - know - but - were - afraid - to - ask , hand waving style , or it can involve nitty - gritty , detailed derivations , anyway a style that suits you and the topic . or it can simply be a dry - run for your presentation at the next risk conference . zimin and alex will take upon the responsibility of organizing the seminar . we hope the seminar will be up and running in two - three weeks . for that purpose your support will be greatly appreciated . please let either zimin or alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and provide a tentative schedule . surely the rest of the group will be happy to hear your presentation . we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting , either to give a talk or just sit in . zimin lu alex huang

" it effectively creates interest and further establishes the point . 3 ) create an interest in the reader from the very first line . your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more . go back to the beginning of this article . the first words were , " it ' s true . " i can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought " what ' s true ? " immediately , your mind wanted to know what i was talking about . before you even knew it you were right here , 8 paragraphs into this article . carefully craft your first line . if you can immediately get them wanting to know more , you ' ve got a winner . 4 ) use bullets . people spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists . in fact , they often reread them over and over . use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service , to spell out exactly what is included in your offer . use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list . 5 ) launch into a bullet list immediately . shortly after your opening line , immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb . hit them with your best shot . pull out the big guns and stress " just a few of " the most important things the reader will discover . by offering a killer list early in your sales letter , you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy . after all , if they are already interested after the first list of benefits , they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them . 6 ) just let it all flow out . write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter . you can edit it later . if you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer , you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind . write it all down . then read through it - you ' ll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points . edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas . 7 ) make your sales letter personal . make sure that the words " you " and " your " are at least 4 : 1 over " i " and " my . " your ad copy must be written about your customer not yourself . i ' m not sure how the old advertising adage goes , but it ' s something like this , " i don ' t care a thing about your lawn mower , i just care about my lawn . " leads aren ' t interested in you or your products , they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs . when you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage , run a check at http : / / www . keywordcount . com and see what the ratio between " you " and " your " versus references to " i , " " me , " " my , " etc . it ' s a free service . make sure it ' s at least 4 : 1 in favor of the customer . 8 ) write like you speak . forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you . write your sales letters in everyday language , just like you would talk in person . don ' t be afraid to begin sentences with " and " or " because . " don ' t worry about ending a sentence with a preposition . write like you speak . your sales letter isn ' t the great american novel , so don ' t write it like you are ernest hemingway . 9 ) use short paragraphs consisting of 2 - 4 sentences each . long copy works . . . but long paragraphs do not . use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph . don ' t be afraid to use short sentences . like this one . or this . see what i mean ? shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader . longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted . 10 ) stress the benefits , not the features . again , readers want the burning question answered , " what ' s in it for me ? " what need is it going to meet ? what want is it going to fill ? how is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader ? spell it out . don ' t focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader . for example : if you are selling automobile tires , you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world , but who cares ? i don ' t care about your selection . but , i do care about keeping my 3 - month - old baby girl safe while we are traveling . so , instead of focusing on your selection , you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car . you ' re not selling tires , you ' re selling safety for my family . stress the benefits , not the features . 11 ) keep the reader interested . some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can perform some complicated surgery on my wife . they are filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to understand . unless you are writing to a very targeted audience , avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand . keep it simple , using words , language and information that are easy to understand and follow . 12 ) target your sales letter . when you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter , target it to a specific audience . for example : if you are selling a " work at home " product , then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers . then , rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students . write another letter targeting senior citizens . still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation . the possibilities are endless . all you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience . " work only 5 hours a week , " would become " college students , work only 5 hours a week . " your sales letter is now targeted . upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website ( you could easily target 100 ' s of groups ) . then , simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums . you could advertise the " college students " page in a campus ezine . the " senior citizens " page could be advertised at a retirement community message board . by creating these targeted sales letters , you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to . and , in their eyes , it looks like the product was a match made for them . 13 ) make your ad copy easy to follow . use short sentences and paragraphs . break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph . one thing that i have always found to work very well in sales letters . . . . . . is to use a pause like this . start the sentence on one line , leaving the reader wanting to know more , and then finishing up on the next line . also , if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website , use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking . " let ' s get you started down the road to success , shall we ? click here to continue . " 14 ) use similes and metaphors for effect . when the customer purchases your product , they will generate " a flood of traffic that would make noah start building another ark . " if they do not order today , then they will " feel like a cat that let the mouse get away . " use words to create a picture in the readers ' mind . when you think of superman , what comes to mind ? immediately , we remember that he is " faster than a speeding bullet . " " more powerful than a locomotive . " " able to leap tall buildings in a single bound . " see how word pictures stick in our minds ? 15 ) focus on one product or service . don ' t try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time . it only confuses the reader . keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service . then , use other products and services as back - end products . 16 ) make it stand out . don ' t kid yourself . there are hundreds , maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing . how will you stand out among the crowd ? your sales letter must inject personality . it must breathe of originality . your product or service is different . it ' s not like all of the rest . it is unique . right ? your sales letter must separate you from the competition . it must create a feeling of " you won ' t find this anywhere else . " 17 ) be believable . " earn $ 54 , 000 in the next 24 hours ! ! ! " delete . good grief , do they think i am an idiot or something ? get real . don ' t make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth . you ' ll ruin your reputation . let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed . once you have been branded a liar , you will never be anything but a liar . it doesn ' t matter if you launch the most respectable , honest business available anywhere , people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you ' ve said before . be believable . don ' t exaggerate , mislead , stretch or distort the truth . 18 ) be specific . don ' t generalize your information , but rather be exact . instead of " over 100 tips for losing weight " use " 124 tips for losing weight . " by generalizing information , it creates doubt and questions in the reader ' s mind . " what am i really getting here ? does he even know ? " when you use specific information , the reader begins to think , " this person must have counted . i know exactly what i can expect . " " platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck , " wrote claude hopkins in his classic book " scientific advertising . " " they leave no impression whatsoever . " 19 ) be complete . tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service . answer all of their questions , anything they would want to consider before making a purchase . think about it from their point of view . ask yourself , " why wouldn ' t i buy this ? " then , address that in your sales letter . remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase . 20 ) use testimonials to boost your sales . share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service . many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed . satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader . " if these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product , then i probably will too . " especially effective are testimonials from respected , well known " authorities " within your target field . 21 ) use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter . a headline isn ' t just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy . use them frequently - but don ' t overuse . a well - placed headline re - grabs the reader ' s attention , brings them deeper into the letter , and readies them for the next paragraph . you will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter . they are that important . 22 ) avoid asking stupid questions . " wouldn ' t you like to make $ 1 , 000 , 000 a year ? " " doesn ' t that sound great ? " " would you like to be as successful as i am ? " avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior . 23 ) offer a freebie even if the customer doesn ' t buy . if the customer decides he or she isn ' t going to make a purchase , then you want to follow - up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future . by offering a free item , you can request their email address in order to obtain the freebie . by doing this , you can now follow - up with the customer for a potential future sale . additionally , you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy , banners , flyers , etc . within the free item . and , of course , if your free item is a high quality , useful product or service which impresses the customer , they probably will be back as a customer soon . 24 ) use bonuses to overwhelm the reader . one of the things that i have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that out - value the actual product i am offering . ginsu made this one famous . they were selling a set of steak knives , but before the commercial was finished , you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse . make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless , outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer . 25 ) use connective phrases like " but wait , there ' s more " and " but that ' s not all . " these phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next , particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits , or leads into bonus items . again , the idea is more and more value and benefits to the reader . 26 ) always include a deadline . by including a deadline , you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer . " if i don ' t order within 24 hours , then i won ' t get the bonuses . " " oh no , there are only 10 items remaining , i ' ve got to hurry . " let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don ' t make the deadline . remember , they won ' t miss out on your products or bonuses , they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products . deadlines are very effective . every sales letter should have one . 27 ) tell them exactly how to order . be clear as to the order process . point them towards the order link . tell them what methods you offer . ( i . e . credit cards , checks , etc . ) make this process as simple and clear as can be . if it takes more than 2 steps , most people won ' t continue . 28 ) explain when the product will be delivered . how quickly will the order be processed ? when will the order be available ? let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order . the more specific you can be here , the better . let them know that you have a system in place . " operators are standing by . " their order will be handled properly . tell them . 29 ) offer a money back guarantee . take away their last reason to hold back . offer a " no questions asked " 30 day guarantee . most people may not realize this , but in most cases , it ' s the law of the land . you are required to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service . since it ' s the law anyway , why not make it a benefit . let them know that they are purchasing your product or service risk - free . 30 ) instruct them to respond immediately . many people just need to read those words , " act now ! " " order today ! " " click here to instantly place your order . " you ' ve got them this far , now tell them what you want them to do . get them to " act fast ! " have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn ' t prompt the viewer to order right way ? 31 ) include a post script . people will always read the p . s . always . in fact , the p . s . is one of the most important parts of your sales letter . why ? because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost . a p . s . is a perfect place to recap your offer , so when they see your price tag , they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money . use your p . s . to restate your offer in detail . 32 ) include a second post script . you better believe if they read the first p . s . , they will read a p . p . s . use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order . i guarantee you they will read it . use these 32 tips and i guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters . in fact , it would be impossible for your responses to not improve . copyright 2000 jimmy d . brown . all rights reserved worldwide . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - about the author . . . jimmy d . brown is helping average people get out of the rat - race and earn a full - time living online . for more details on firing your boss and creating your own internet wealth , visit us right now at : * special offer : join the profits vault through the above link and email me your receipt and you can have a free bonus copy of the terrific manual - how to profit from free ebooks guaranteed which i sell at :  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  member showcase  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  examine carefully - those with email addresses included will trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them . there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at these successful sites programs other members are involved in . . . affiliates of the world ! top rated affiliate programs , excellent business opportunities , great marketing resources and free advertising for you ! visit the site to trade links . http : / / www . affiliates . uk . com trade links - adrianbold @ affiliates . uk . com get insane amounts of traffic to your website . purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic  more money ! less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited . order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com trade links - businessopps @ aol . com celebration sale ! $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores , gift stores , adult sites toy stores . mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price . order now ! http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?

users , rights , books , global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis . some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other . 3 ) integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work . we will not be testing functional permutations , data conditions , validation or exceptions to any significant degree . 4 ) each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing . we are operating from the premise that data , infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts . 4 ) all systems will be physically split ( even unify at this point ) . 5 ) integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co . 6 ) we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production . 7 ) we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes . there are two teams - conversion and integration test . each team will focus on both estate and new co . resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility . 8 ) estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest . estate conversion is on the critical path for new co . key issues 1 ) we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first , then physical . if financial is the focus , delivery risk goes down dramatically . for now , we must plan on the worst case - - physical and financial on jan 20 . 2 ) we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate . this means that we need a dev environment ( and hw gap addressed ) for unify , sitara , cpr , tagg / erms . conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we ' re in synch . 3 ) unify servers probably can ' t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify . 4 ) some systems are using ' short name ' instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global . the global , tagg / erms , unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks . 5 ) we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates . we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading . 6 ) we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep / bridgeline considerations . the time window will be very small . core conversion team 1 ) steve stock -

2	Subject: calif governor declares state of emergency breaking news : ca governor declares state of emergency posted 2 : 37 am ( cst ) jan 18 , 2001 late wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more with electricity supplies drying up throughout the west , california gov . gray davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the beleaguered state grid . in making the bold move , gov . davis also announced that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5 % . in the emergency proclamation , the governor said that electricity presently available through california three major investor - owned utilities is " insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric service , " and thus , he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage . then he went on to specifically empower the water resources agency , which has been a key player in helping the state ' s transmission grid operator ( cal - iso ) narrowly avoid blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state . noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on target for a 200 mw reduction and the water resources department peak pumping load has been reduced by 450 mw , gov . davis lauded californians for having " stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for electricity , " noting that the state already is 47 th in the nation among the lowest per - capita energy use and the state ' s electricity prices are the 10 th highest in the nation .

2	Subject: continental power - the case for greater experience / breadth of view in the controllers ' position sally further to our discussion on friday i summarise my view of joe gold ' s issues with the mo control process joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows : - the dpr has historically been ' filled with noise ' around adjustments for edits on trades , provision restatements etc which negates it ' s effectiveness for him as a control / supervisory report the risk team appear to have been reacting to p & l ' noise ' - particularly around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking solutions - or instructing it to flex enpower settlements have gained a perception in the market place for ' errors ' such that originators are informing joe that business is being ' lost ' due to our perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no specifics on errors have been provided ) the risk team ( post neil tarling ' s transfer to ebs ) is relatively junior and does not possess many ' years ' of experience of power support james new as power , gas and credit controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a role for him to focus on these detailed issues in mitigation the recent continental book split ( which is only now being ' settled ' in to the daily process ) and the clean up of historic provisions / reserves prior to neil tarling ' s transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of daily p & l designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the prioritisation call was not effectively communicated to joe ) - and it is felt that there are no it resources to code these solutions to enpower ( also london struggles to influence houston it resource prioritisation ) the settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires ' skilled ' staff ( we are down on resources for continental power ) - continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff being asked to join commercial groups we are experiencing generational change as a result of barry ' s move to ebs - resourcing is james and my top priority i believe what joe is asking for , is what we are trying to provide - namely : upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead individual has full responsibility , end to end , for the business including the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process , focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that eliminates ' manual workarounds ' and consequently ' noise ' in the process more proactive communication with commercial - especially to manage expectations a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture for mo will benefit / change his business support however , we are behind in finding the ' right ' replacement for neil ( one with experience and breadth of view potential ) , we have found a continental power settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until july 3 rd , we have been struggling with book split when that should have been completed a month ago and it is taking time to get all the ducks lined up re our plans for enlighten / dtl / envoice / autoconfirms / dcaf - hence his frustration about lost business opportunities now ! ! hence i would love to find someone who could deliver the above ( ie be neil tarling ' s replacement ) or could assist us in providing and communicating the judgement calls on transmission and other adjustments - so improving perception of c . p . dpr prioritising and influencing enpower development agenda ( along with others ) project manage issues around ' unstable ' documentation and settlement process vis a vis client sensitivity provide leadership in changing expectations / perceptions i ' m sorry for the length of the note but it may help you in determining a ' best fit ' person please call if any of the above is unclear . mike

2	Subject: california 1 / 17 / 01 summary : late night efforts by the california assembly to craft a legislative solution are falling short of market and creditor expectations . bankruptcy appears increasingly likely , but the dynamics of a ch . 11 proceeding remain unclear . socal edison is likely to be the first in ch . 11 following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period . attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed . bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the california power authority . 1 . legislation passes assembly , but generators and consumers remain unhappy the first legislation ( ab lx ) passed the california general assembly last night , but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms . generators object to the 5 . 5 cent per kw / h price in the proposed long - term contract , while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power . the legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor davis as early as tonight . press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill , which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities . 2 . financial institutions exposure to california utilities bank of america : $ 215 million j . p . morgan : $ 202 million there is a total of $ 12 billion in outstanding loans , but much of this ( arranged by societe general ) is to the parents national energy group and edison international . the $ 417 million mentioned above is the most immediate concern . the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterday ' s rating downgrade to junk status . the fed will not be involved , except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities ' loans and securities . there is no moral hazard here , because the fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities ' credits , which , by the way , they do not have the authority to do . 3 . pg & e / national energy group - shielding assets despite considerable anger at pg & e for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debt - plagued utility business , it would seem that davis has little authority to intervene . the question of " fraudulent conveyance " , which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing ( which transfer can then be reversed by the court ) would not seem to apply here , since pg dynegy has threaten to take take edison into bankruptcy court if they default pg & e current available : $ 500 m in cash and reserves due feb : lst - $ 580 m to iso 15 th - $ 431 m to california power exchange contrary to press reports and leaks from the governor ' s office yesterday about political brinksmanship , edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash . in this situation , it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements . the bonds on which they failed to pay would have a 30 - day cure period . after that the trustees will move on edison , if edison has not already filed . they have three ways of financing power purchases going forward : 1 ) the state continues to buy power and sell edison ( and pg or 2 ) pending the passage of today ' s legislation , the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long - term contracts under the proposed borrowing authority ; or 3 ) edison files for reorganization under chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post - petition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets , which it uses to pay for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase . 6 . new hampshire experience a guide for davis ? following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire , the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes . the prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable , passing a seven year rate hike of 7 . 5 percent . for davis , a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover , if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement .

2	Subject: california update 9 - 06 - 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summary assembly ' s mou supporters " mia , " vote stalled bailout hang - ups : land , bonds , and referendum socal up for grabs ? mou support waning as of last night , assemblyman hertzberg reportedly had 25 votes in favor of the bailout that he could " count on . " there were 10 more votes that were " close " and stood a " reasonable chance " of being cast in favor of the bailout . however , that still left hertzberg 9 votes short of the 41 he needs . earlier today , sen . polanco , the bill ' s sponsor , privately indicated that the few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended sb 78 xx were in place due to lobbying efforts by gov . davis . no doubt the count will be close , but hertzberg will only take the bill up in the assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows democrats can muster enough support . the key issues related to getting the 41 votes to pass sb 78 xx are the following : including the option to buy the transmission lines . for some this is a philosophical issue ; these members are quite adamant that the option to buy the lines needs to be removed from sb 78 xx . excess profits and creditworthiness - in particular how edison can use any profits . the philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necessary given the experience with pg if the language comes out of the bill , the plan will no longer be acceptable to socal . socal : selling out or going under there is word in sacramento of companies " sniffing around " for a pre - packaged purchase of edison after the bankruptcy occurs . we will continue to investigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available . it is also rumored that if an " inadequate " bill passes - i . e . , one that will not return socal to creditworthiness - socal may declare voluntary bankruptcy , then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy . the only requirement laid upon socal is to attempt to go back into the market by january 2003 , and there is no penalty for them failing to do so . there appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them from using money from the bailout in bankruptcy .

2	Subject: still working on it but here ' s where we are louise , i would like you to re - consider our original proposal for a few reasons . i have a lot of history on this one given i ' ve been on both sides of the fence and was the original creator of what ultimately became the eim group . as a result , i have been in many discussions with lou and jeff on these issues . in the original agreement between ees and ena the following sic codes were excluded from ees as part of the minority shareholder agreement in 1996 / 1997 : mining ( except oil and gas ) ; oil and gas extraction textile manufacturing paper manufacturing chemical manufacturing petroleum and coal products manufacturing plastics and rubber products manufacturing glass manufacturing primary metal manufacturing fabricated and metals products manufacturing machinery manufacturing rail transportation . all other sic codes fell within ees . in 2000 , with the buy - back of the minority shareholders , lou , jeff and i agreed to move several of the lower process load sic codes into ees including textile manufacturing ( like springs industries ) , glass manufacturing ( like owens corning ) , fabricated and metals product manufacturing ( like general cable and american national can ) and machinery manufacturing ( like lockheed martin ) . this was primarily because these customers tend to be of lower energy sophistication and consumption , numerous sites ( in deregulated and regulated environments ) and of small size . the ees value proposition fit these customers much better than wholesale . we have completed numerous significant term transactions and outsources in these industries ( see parenthesis for several ) . for the other sic codes , these remained in ena and eim . ees has no interest in paper mills , smelters , fertilizer manufacturers , refiners , etc . we neither have the products or pricing capability to manage or close very large process oriented consumers . however , there are divisions inside these companies that we have been able to have some success . for example , the speciality chemicals divisions of the large chemical companies tend to be significantly smaller loads and ignored from a capital , dsm and commodity point of view by the large purchasing agents . another example , is the gasoline retailing networks for the large oil and gas / refining companies which can be very small loads spread over thousands of sites . another example , is the specialty paper / container board divisions of the paper companies . in several of the large oil and gas and petrochemical companies we have found fertile ground in their office buildings and research centers . our proposal to limit ees ' s activities in the ena sic codes by consumption size was to give us some freedom to target these divisions inside these companies which ena would normally ignore . if there is a better way to split this out than by a size definition lets discuss . finally , given the more targeted and sophisticated sales process utilized in ees ( by necessity ) , it would be easier to coordinate between the companies based on a size sort where ees had limited access to ena ' s sic codes versus the opposite . on the surface your proposal looks reasonable ; however , it fails to sufficiently manage the issues . for example : - how would you manage a customer like wal - mart which may use more than 10 mw at a site but requires a national or regional solution for all 10 , 000 sites in both deregulated and regulated jurisdictions ; - how will we sufficiently manage the ena sales force which tends to over - cover and " under - product " for the vast majority of these industries and customers ie ) i think it would be a disaster for ees and ena ; - and ees has the relationship based selling capability and basic products to successfully manage these customers ( you could argue right now that is all we have ! ) . on a final note , i believe strongly that john and i should send out a note to both organizations clarifying these issues because : a ) it is way overdue - years in fact - it was always difficult when i was upstairs to get lou to cooperate ; b ) it is extremely destructive and un - productive for multiple enron groups to communicate and target the same customer ; c ) i don ' t believe that the employees ( on both side of the fence ) will honor the obligation unless it is expressly stated , openly communicated and enforced by the two management teams ; and d ) we need to be proactive , because " cleaning " it up after the dual call , etc significantly damages our credibility as enron with a number of these customers . it may be worthwhile in the same exercise to let you know what we may be doing in the the utility and generator markets in the interest of open communication and ensure your buy - in . i look forward to futher discussing this with you . our motivations are not to try and enter ena markets but to split the industrial and commercial segments between the two companies clearly which increases productivity and shareholder value . regards delainey - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by david w delainey / hou / ees on 03 / 24 / 2001 01 : 51 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - janet r dietrich 03 / 23 / 2001 05 : 28 pm to : david w delainey / hou / ees @ ees cc : subject : still working on it but here ' s where we are fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by janet r dietrich / hou / ees on 03 / 23 / 2001 05 : 28 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - louise kitchen @ ect 03 / 23 / 2001 05 : 27 pm to : janet r dietrich / hou / ees @ ees cc : subject : still working on it but here ' s where we are janet , tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon . i have removed the split from east to west . load power ena > 10 mw hourly peak demand ees 1 , 000 mmbtus / day ees < 1 , 000 mmbtus / day i am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value . louise

i turned $ 4 . 50 into $ 14 , 706 within the first 30 days of operating the business plan that i am about to reveal to you free of charge . if you decide to take action on the following instructions , i will personally guarantee that you will enjoy a similar return ! worldwide participation ! - you can participate if paypal is in your country - here is a list of all paypal countries to get started copy the whole document and insert your email in the right place below . this is a very profitable business . so , just make a nice cup of tea and get started on it now . after all , you can ' t lose , but you stand to gain more in the next few weeks than many people earn in a year ! my name is charles davis . i was made redundant from my job in june of 2003 , along with several other employees at the printing firm where i worked . at that time i was living beyond my means and in serious debt . several debt collectors were hounding me on an almost daily basis , and this consequently started a chain reaction that ended with the repossession of my car and then my home . as you can probably imagine , my prospects looked pretty bleak . then , in march of 2004 , i received a short and simple email telling me how to make over $ 15 , 000 at a time . i ignored it because of course , i was skeptical . however , i didn ' t delete that email because something about it rang true to me , and i was desperate to know whether it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time . i finally realized that i had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email . and apart from that , i just couldn  t stop myself from thinking  what if it actually works ?  therefore , i put my doubts to one side and i went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email . it took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than $ 4 . 50 . and yet , by the end of 2004 , i was able to book the family holiday of a lifetime in miami , and i bought a brand new audi a 8 with hard cash . and in the autumn of 2004 , i purchased a tidy semi - detached home for no less than $ 125 , 000 . and yet , i don  t owe a single penny to anyone ! to date , i have made exactly $ 392 , 718 . my accountant has drawn up a cash - flow forecast in which he predicts that , within the next 24 months , i will become a millionaire just through this one business alone . even now as i write this , i find it strange to come to terms with the fact that , like most people , i  ve worked hard and struggled all my life just to  get by  and then something ridiculously simple drops into my lap and immediately turns my life around completely . when i think back to all the similar emails i had previously deleted , it makes me shudder , because now i know just how close i came to missing out completely . what did it say in that email ? well , if you ' ll read on , all will be revealed ! this is the cheapest , fastest and easiest way to make serious money online - period ! the business plan i am about to share with you works perfectly every single time . i  ve never made less than $ 15 , 000 from it on each occasion . let me assure you that this is a legitimate business opportunity , a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise . it does not require you to sell anything , or speak to your friends , family or anybody else ( unless you want to ) . in fact , you do not need to come into contact with any people whatsoever . anyone with a pulse can make their fortune with this system . if you believe that  every dog has his day  , then follow the simple step - by - step plan exactly as it is set out below . if you do this and this alone , i guarantee that within the next 30 days you will see a lot of $ 1000 s coming in and by the 2 nd or 3 rd month you will receive over $ 15 , 000 in cash per month via your paypal account . i know this must sound like an outrageous claim , particularly if you ' ve never had possession of this sort of money before , but believe me , this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life ! please do not allow your initial skepticism to deprive you of certain financial success . i am so certain that you will make a serious income with what i ' m going to tell you that i ' m willing to roll up my sleeves and help you begin - now !

let ' s get started , just follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for a huge influx of cash over the next 30 days ! here ' s what you need to do . . . step 1 - sign up for a free paypal account if you ' re not already a paypal user , the very first thing you need to do is click on the paypal link below and sign up . it takes just 2 minutes ! here ' s the link : be sure to use this link so you can sign up for a free business account . you ' ll need to have a business account ( and not a personal account ) otherwise you won ' t be able to receive credit card payments from other people . step 2 - send a $ 4 . 50 payment to the email address at number 1 in the list to get the book once you have your paypal ® account , the first thing you need to do is send a $ 4 . 50 payment from your paypal ® account to the first email address in the list below , along with a note in the  subject  and  note  columns stating please send me the lucrative home business with best marketing tips ebook ( see an example below of one of my transactions ) . be certain to add this note , because this is the book you will sell to people who will send you payments sample : amount : $ 4 . 50 us subject : please send me the lucrative home business with best marketing tips ebook type : service note : please send me the lucrative home business with best marketing tips ebook when making the payment in paypal , select  service  from the dropdown menu marked  type  . the instructions on how to send a payment are under send money after you  ve logged into the paypal account . - it  s very easy . here ' s the current list : note the spaces before the @ sign . add your email in the same manner . please clear this space only when you want to send payment or when you want to send email to any of the 5 members - its to protect you and members from unwanted automated email responses . 1 . cantabraxil @ yahoo . com 2 . emgclyde 3 @ yahoo . com 3 . mark 5 _ 24 @ yahoo . com 4 . phonedsa 24 @ yahoo . com 5 . phil @ serverlon . com as soon as you transfer a $ 4 . 50 payment to the email address at the top of the list , something very eerie happens . it gives you an indescribable , overwhelming sense of certainty , and belief in the system . you  ve just proved to yourself that , because you have done it , there must be a great number of other people ready to do exactly the same . thus you have now seen for yourself , first hand , that this business actually works ! step 3 - create and send your message now you need to copy all the text on this page , as you ' ll be e - mailing it out to at least 40 people . the copy that you will send out will contain your email address at number 5 in the list in step 2 ( you should use the extra email address with autoresponder that you created in step 4 ) . to do this , you need to remove the email address at number 1 and move the other four addresses up a position to accommodate yours at number 5 . now all you need to do is enter the email address of each person you want to send your message to , and then click on the send button . you should send out a minimum of 40 copies of the email ( at least 40 emails sent 1 by 1 by hand to ensure delivery ) - but to people you know , or to people who respond business opportunity and mlm offers , or to people who ' ve sent you offers . this is not considered spam . note : if you want to send out more than 40 emails to increase your profits ( recommended ) . please make sure to send out the first 40 emails 1 by 1 , by hand to increase delivery . this guarantees delivery of at least 40 emails - you can increase you speed by clicking the back button on your browser after each send and enter a new email address and send again . . if you prefer to use your own email program to send your message , right - click on this page and choose select all . then right - click again and choose copy . then go to your email program and then paste the text into a new email message . step 4 - to be able to deliver the ebook automatically to the numerous payments you receive . to enjoy the ease of this business you can setup automatic delivery of this ebook after a payment is made to you . so for example if you receive 300 payments overnight , your autoresponder will send automatic emails to all of them to download the e - book even before you wake up . . you will need to setup an autoresponder - - instructions are below . 1 . go to www . yahoo . com or www . yahoo . fr , www . yahoo . de or the yahoo for your country . you can also setup non yahoo autoresponders . if you know how and wish to do that then skip to # 6 . 2 . signup for a new yahoo mail account by clicking on signup for new account - its free 3 . after you complete the signup , go into your new account and click on mail options on the top right . 4 then click on the vacation response link near the bottom . 5 . select a period of 6 months for the vacation response 6 . below in the generic response text area . copy and paste the text from the autoresponder email that you received after you made your payment . - that way all the hundreds of people that will pay you will get auto delivery like you just did . 7 . below that click on a button that says turn autoresponder on and you are done with the autoresponder setup . 8 now that you are done . paypal allows you to add up to 8 email addresses in your paypal account . so add this yahoo email address to your paypal account by going into your paypal account and clicking on add email 9 . after you add the yahoo email address to paypal and and confirm it . use this email address for this program ( that is , add it to position number 5 of this letter and remove the email address on position 1 . that way all payments you receive will go to that address and the auto responder will respond back with the link to download the ebook automatically . 10 . so again , thisyahoo email is the email address that you will add in number 5 for this letter . you are all set to go - - good luck ! ! ! that ' s all there is to it ! the whole process should take you no more than 30 minutes to complete . be prepared to get excited . . . . you won ' t be disappointed ! ! ! half an hour of easy work is all that ' s needed - no phone calls , no capital outlay , no postage stamps , no printing , copying or waiting , and the concept is 100 % legal . by sending this letter and the payment via email , the response time is extremely fast . within 30 days , over $ 15 , 000 cash will pass through your paypal account . and that  s guaranteed . keep a copy of your email safe so that you can use it again whenever you need more cash ! here ' s how it works : because of the virtually zero investment , speed , and high profit potential , this program has a very high response rate ! as long as you send your emails to people who are likely to be interested in this program , you can expect a response from about 25 % of the people you send to . but let ' s be extremely conservative here and assume that you get only a 12 . 5 % response : you send out your email to 40 different people . you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did ( 12 . 5 % of 40  5 ) . by this time , your email address will have moved up to number 4 in the list , and this list will now have reached around 200 people ( 5 x 40 ) . out of those 200 people , you can expect at least 25 of them to respond ( 12 . 5 % of 200 ) , so that ' s a further 1 , 000 emails ( 25 x 40 ) being sent out with you now at the number 3 position . out of those 1 , 000 people , you can expect at least 125 of them to respond ( 12 . 5 % of 1 , 000 ) , so that ' s a further 5 , 000 emails ( 125 x 40 ) being sent out with you now at the number 2 position . out of those 5 , 000 people , you can expect at least 625 of them to respond ( 12 . 5 % of 5 , 000 ) , so that ' s 25 , 000 emails ( 625 x 40 ) being sent out with you at the number 1 spot ! out of those 25 , 000 people , you can expect around 3 , 125 of them to respond ( 12 . 5 % of 25 , 000 ) . since you will now be at number 1 in the list , you will receive : $ 14 , 062 ( 3 , 125 x $ 4 . 50 ) . over the course of 30 days , this money will be sent to you by a few thousand people just like yourself - who are willing to invest half an hour to receive around $ 15 , 000 in cash ! this is real money that you can spend on anything you wish ! just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it directly from your paypal account ! ! ! it really is that easy ! but there ' s more ! ! ! for each person who signs up with paypal as a result of using your unique referral url , you will automatically receive a referral bonus of up to $ 75 from paypal ! remember , the 12 . 5 % example above is assuming that 35 out of the 40 people you send your email to will do absolutely nothing except delete your email . additionally , the above example assumes that each participant will only send out 40 emails . imagine what would happen if each participant sent out 1 , 000 emails instead of just 40 ! believe me , many people will do this and much more ! only the first person on the list gets your $ 4 . 50 payment , but everyone in the list will rise to that number 1 position as thousands of emails are being sent out . no cheating can occur ( don ' t be fooled by claims that this system can be cheated ) as paypal only allows one account per person . because it is so ridiculously easy , the response rate is very high and very fast - you will start seeing dramatic results in less than one week ! just in time for next month ' s bills ! unlimited income potential ! this program is structured for everyone to send only 40 emails each to start . however , you are certainly not limited to 40 . send out as many emails as you want . every 40 emails you send has a return of at least $ 15 , 000 within 30 days . so , if you can email 50 , or 100 , or whatever , go for it ! the more you put into it . . . . the more you get out ! a word of warning ! don ' t be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast ! it doesn ' t work like that ! if you do that , you ' ll only reach the people you directly send emails to , and then your address will be immediately removed from the number 1 place and you won ' t reach thousands of people ! but , if you add your name to the number 5 position , there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending emails later - when your name is at the number 1 spot ! ! ! so please , play by the rules and the serious money will come to you ! this program doesn ' t cost anything but $ 4 . 50 and about half an hour of your time , and if everyone plays fair , everyone wins ! ! so there it is . you now have the knowledge that will enable you to make over $ 15 , 000 within the next few weeks . the only thing that can hold you back now is a lack of faith or a lack of self - belief . however , any doubts you may currently have will disappear within a few days of putting this plan into practice . trust me on this ! you certainly won ' t regret it . thank you , and good luck in your ventures best regards chuck a e davis p . s . to get started copy the whole document and insert your info in the right place . this is a very profitable business . so , just make a nice cup of tea and get started on it now . after all , you can ' t lose , but you stand to gain more in the next few weeks than many people earn in a year ! to stop receiving this offer , reply this email accordingly but this is a one time send 77255

2	Subject: my dear friend from : mr . alex kajeta . i am sorry at the perceived confussion you may have , by receieving this letter from me since we have not previously met . to be precise i was a former accountant to charles taylor the former president of liberia . i am a citizen of liberia and my name is mr . alex kajeta . i was in charge of buying ammunition in our country . there was money maped out by the former president of liberia charles taylor to buy ammunition to fight rebels . this money is in my possesion right now . the sum of usd 25 million which was meant for purchase of ammunition but was not used for that purpose as a result of international presure on charles taylor to relinquish power . right now charles taylor has steped down from power for a new government . i am explaining the source of this money to you so that you will understand the source of the usd 25 million which i deem that it will be good for me and you to invest this money in your country on profitable business in your country . that is why i am soliciting for a reliable and trustworthy foreigner to help me accomodate this money in your account . this money was deposited in a security company in europe by my instruction through diplomatic means . the document that is backing the deposit of us $ 25 million are currently with me as the accountant to charles taylor . at this junction i can not disclose the security ' s company ' s name to you until you accept my proposal for security reasons . ( 1 ) what i need from you is to help me claim this money ( usd 25 million ) from the security company as my foreign partner . ( 2 ) you are entittled to 30 % of the usd 25 milllion as your share for your assistance . ( 4 ) 5 % will be map out for miscelleneous expenses during the transaction .

2	Subject: re : perry gas - sap override issue the cause of this was the timing of when sap went down . sap had a major system crash the day willie finaled his supply verification in unify . before willie went into sap to net the payable ( same day ) , sap crashed . by the time sap came up , the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the cash . when we issued the recall , the money was already out the door . as a result , we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in unify . this causes them to be blocked in sap and not picked up by treasury until the payment block is removed . this policy went into effect at the beginning of september . however , this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure works . to ensure we don ' t " accidentally " release cash , i have asked unify it to change the interface to send all purchases for ena to sap blocked , which will require the coordinator to release funds . this is an added step , but is worth it considering the stakes . this change will go into effect on monday , 9 / 25 . if you have any questions , please let me know . bryce enron north america corp . from : sally beck 09 / 22 / 2000 04 : 33 pm to : bryce baxter / hou / ect @ ect , leslie reeves / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : perry gas - sap override issue i have read this series of e : mails but i am not sure that i fully understand the issue . did willie not do his job ? are there problems with how sap works ? are both of these an issue ? please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with sap and netting . thanks . - - sally - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by sally beck / hou / ect on 09 / 22 / 2000 04 : 29 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : william s bradford 09 / 22 / 2000 04 : 04 pm to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect cc : debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : perry gas - sap override issue sally , are you aware of the problems with sap ? this error caused an incremental $ 600 , 000 credit loss to perry gas companies that could have been prevented . let me know if you have any questions . bill - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by william s bradford / hou / ect on 09 / 22 / 2000 04 : 02 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : russell diamond 09 / 22 / 2000 03 : 01 pm to : william s bradford / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : perry gas - sap override issue fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by russell diamond / hou / ect on 09 / 22 / 2000 03 : 01 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : bryce baxter 09 / 22 / 2000 02 : 47 pm to : russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : perry gas - sap override issue russell - as i remember , willie finaled the supply verification and it was interfaced to sap . this is fine , and then willie was going to net the a / p and a / r . sap went down after the statement was interfaced , but before willie was able to block or net the payment . when sap came back up the next day , the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire . if you have any further questions about this , call me . thanks . from : russell diamond 09 / 22 / 2000 01 : 46 pm to : willie stewart / hou / ect @ ect cc : audrey cook / hou / ect @ ect , bryce baxter / hou / ect @ ect subject : perry gas - sap override issue willie , per our earlier conversation , can you or audrey or bryce , please give further explain to me as to why the funds were wired to perry gas for purchases from the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales . you mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty ' s that net on sap , although because of timing , the override did not take place . thank you , russell

2	Subject: california 02 / 16 / 01 pt . 2 our source reports the following regarding today ' s developments . in sum , due to the governor ' s sudden panic and resultant willingness to negotiate , all parties are in a wait - and - see mode that makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing early next week . our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome , but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend . creditors , especially the small ipps are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations . the events given in this report are chronological : - the original plan proposed by governor davis to the utilities this morning contained the following points : the parent companies of the utilities would have to return to their subsidiaries $ 1 . 5 billion . this money was originally tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it to pay taxes . however , as was revealed in the audit , this money was in excess of what was needed for taxes in reality . the state would purchase the transmission assets for $ 3 . 5 billion . it was proposed that the utilities would issue bonds to pay for the utilities ' undercollection . these bonds would be secured against a " distribution charge " added to power bills . this money would be collected by dwr and transferred to the utilities , thereby involving the state , but with less than a " full faith and credit " commitment . - in contradiction to preliminary reports that appeared in the press , this plan was rejected by the utilities . one reason for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets . - while the bondholders pressed for further negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached ; this is because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators . the generators , however , demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing . - local sources report that governor davis " panicked " at this point . he then offered to purchase the transmission assets for $ 6 billion ( almost twice the earlier offer ) and pay the generators ' undercollection ( which amounts to $ 9 to $ 12 billion ) . reportedly , the suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail - out was 15 years , which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail - out . this plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill . - at this point , consumer advocate harvey rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer ' s office . rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan , he would start a referendum to counter it . rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place . knowledgeable sources advise that it would be " very difficult " for the bonds in the plan to be issued in less than 90 days ; therefore , rosenfield poses a credible threat . - in subsequent negotiations , governor davis has offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $ 6 billion , but possibly as high as $ 12 billion . - senator president pro tem john burton is ' very upset ' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so easily . - mike florio , another consumer advocate , contacted gov . davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail - out , as it appeared davis intended to do , was " ridiculous . " florio and the other consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with rosenfield and support the referendum if davis pursued such a course of action . the consumer advocates strongly feel that the generators have to " take a hair cut " as part of the solution , as well . - the governor will announce later this afternoon a " framework " solution identical to that we have reported previously - a state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities , but with state support through the dwr . however , the state government has yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework , and it remains unclear whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties . - with this announcement , the bondholders may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the final agreement will be . the generators , while more inclined to file themselves , may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it may be worthwhile to wait and see , as well . they are interested not only in the terms of the agreement ( and particularly the amount paid for the undercollect ) , but also in the terms of the long - term power contracts that the state must negotiate . for example , if the state is willing to purchase power at high prices in order to placate the generators , they would be very likely to go along with the plan . -

2	Subject: california update - - 09 . 17 . 01 here is some additional information since the circus closed down in sacramento on saturday morning . the senate adjourned early saturday morning , closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session . the assembly adjourned a few hours later , closing the regular session , but not the second extraordinary session . the legislature ' s options : 1 ) the governor calls them back in two weeks , they continue with the second extraordinary session , and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till saturday morning . 2 ) the governor calls them back in two weeks , the assembly ends the second extraordinary session , they begin a third extraordinary session , and the bills that were left hanging on saturday morning must start the process from scratch . however , they can pass a " waiver , " which effectively would allow them to start a 3 rd session and then pick up where they left off on saturday morning . 3 ) the governor calls them back in two weeks and the legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything , i . e . , the govenor can call them back , but he can ' t make them vote . in short , the legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please . where to from here ? through its actions on saturday morning , the senate has sent a strong signal to davis that the senate is not inclined to vote out an edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last july . just before closing down on saturday , the senate also passed a resolution declaring that " . . . the condition of electric service in california no longer consitutes a ' sudden and severe energy shortage ' " and " . . . that the state of emergency proclaimed by the governor on january 17 , 2001 , is at and end . " the resolution seems to send an additional signal that the senate does not see any great need to bail out edison . the assembly did not pass the resolution , however . given the senate ' s view , and the open hositility between davis and burton , davis ' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the senate with vetoes unless the senate first passes the davis ' edison bill . it is unclear at this time whether davis would play it that tough . with the legislature gone , the action turns to the puc , where a vote on da suspension is scheduled for thursday . we are working with customers and providers to stop da from being suspended , or at a minimum , to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive . finally , burton held a news conference this morning at which he said : burton and senator bowen ( bowen ' s been taking the lead on da in the senate ) will ask the california puc to do a study on how da can be retained without " adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses . " he doesn ' t know why " the governor would waste taxpayers ' money to hold a special session . " with all the troubled businesses in california right now , he doesn ' t know why the state would bail edison out and not the others . if all this sounds ridiculous , it is . we ' ll report back with additional information as we get it . best , jeff

2	Subject: re : transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an internal approach to internal audit dear mike , thanks for your insight . in the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with brm . through my calls the past week , i ' ve been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the enron europe work , as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative . my next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locations / commodities they ' d be best to work on . i ' ll send you an updated schedule once i ' ve finalized this . thanks shona mike jordan @ ect 10 / 11 / 2000 09 : 37 am to : shawn kilchrist / na / enron @ enron , shona wilson / na / enron @ enron cc : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an internal approach to internal audit shawn / shona we have talked round this issue for some time so i thought i would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is ( we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely ) : - aims accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams . a culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive on - going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking . any independent process of review such as doorstep and brm should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it all elements of implementing , completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output we focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls ( we have defined the control structure for trading offices , agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office ) the output from enron ' s perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at control / governance meetings ( eg at sally / ted / fernley ' s level and at the audit committee level ) - the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior / experienced staff the output from aa ' s perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it trading process - monthly routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle - rating made by business controller is red , amber , green - with trend indicator of static , improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full listing monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see attachment 1 ( you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 2 - and as a senior controller i would expect the metrics to underpin but not solely drive the judgement within the self assessment ) - shona , this is the work that mike moscoso is leading periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss operational risk and areas of concern ( red and amber ) with agreement of action plans for such areas monthly review by controller / senior controller of database where all high ( red ) and medium ( amber ) risk issues are recorded . milestones for action plans revisited , reconfirmed or amended monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if the risk rating for any remote offices has changed all new information on issues raised by self assessment , doorstep review or brm completion populated into database database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and decision on whether original brm and doorstep plans require amendment process - yearly planning checkpoint taken of current operational environment ( say end oct ) proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in office , and it development plans for next year prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what depth does report need to go to . note the doorstep review would be an end to end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the review effort on areas of concern , the actions plans in place and concluding on the ' mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level ' prioritisation made for brm - which functions , not business units , require external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes ( could aa signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process ? ) - most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as fx exposure management , cash management , credit exposure management , it change management controls / process where are we now - if we all thought to do this immediately we do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - i am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the houston offsite do this ? 23 rd oct the above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week oct we agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the brm and doorstep databases - november given aa have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate the database from scratch - november review doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to visit all ?

( 4 to 5 days ) we then requested that the roswell cdc ( ernie delossantos ) determine the availability of approximately 150 " of x 42 356 wall 10 " pipe , 12 ea . y 42 365 wall 90 ' s , and 1 ea . y 42 365 wall 45 . ( all material is available at redman supply in farmington ) conclusion : mr . dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us that we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels . the stress levels calculated by dickinson were in excess of yield as follows : 1 . 09 % of smys at the connection between the recycle / surge line and the discharge header , and 1 . 01 % of smys at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10 " recycle line . his recommendation was that the piping be cut and re - welded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe supports , not subject to subsidence , be provided . conference calls with engineering ( spalding , eisenstein , rance , pebdani , minnoti ? ? ? ) were set up to review the data with mr . dickenson and it was decided to have greg mcilwain on location monday in conjunction with mike mccracken to initiate the necessary repairs . after much discussion with dickenson with regards to the modeling performed , engineering indicated that the system is operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early next week when repairs are made . the repairs will be isolated to the # 3 unit only so , the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days ( 48 hours ) . however , furhter evaluation by mcilwain will confirm timelines . if anyone has questions through the weekend prior to mondays call , i can be reached at 520 - 853 - 3253 .

2	Subject: re : equity investment fair value in turkey john , it seems to me that using a risk - free rate is not appropriate . i shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon ( my time ) . vince enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe from : john bottomley 06 / 19 / 2000 05 : 55 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect subject : equity investment fair value in turkey vince , john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to value these options first , some additional information . option characteristics : - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company ) - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or turkish lire ) we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75 per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds ) are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due to such a large " valuation gap " , they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early oct ) . our counter - proposal is to " swap " instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term . we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy ) a few key points : - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this " to be negotiated " discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation ) - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we obviously do not exercise . we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel rac ' s approach is double counting . if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information . regards , john bottomley

cut north - flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from la plata to meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through kemmerer ; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations ; entitle for undertakes or overtakes , as appropriate ; and finally , if required , northwest will issue operational flow orders . if net scheduled volumes north through northwest ' s kemmerer compressor do not exceed physical capacity , northwest will have much greater flexibility during the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins . northwest ' s customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that kemmerer will overschedule by securing adequate gas from canadian suppliers or by using their jackson prairie storage during this work . northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins and will be monitoring the situation closely . northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate . northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently , the impact of the transwestern and questar maintenance will be greatly reduced . if you have any questions , please contact your marketing services representative .

2	Subject: good news from ferc no action needed by either of you . you can ignore this if you like . the issue is really complicated and i ' ve tried to summarize it . i ' m not sure how closely the two of you have been tracking activities at ferc . we had an interim victory late last week on the chargeback issue . as edison and pacific gas were defaulting on px and iso payments in january and february , the px attempted to invoke the charge back section of its tariff . this had several strange outcomes . first , the px attempted to recover the short payments by edison for december activity by charging px market participants based on a three month rolling average of gross sales . if the px owed a supplier money , they simply short - payed by the prorata amount . if the market participant owed the px money , the px added it to the participants bill . this created a series of short pays and chargebacks . if a market participant who received a chargeback bill didn ' t pay ( e . g . , pg & e for sce ' s december px activity ) , the px would then allocate that amount ( via short pays and chargebacks ) to other participants . this iterative process would continue until credit - worthy participants shouldered the burden . the px attempted to us an equally bizarre method to allocate defaults by the utilities on their iso rt energy bill ( the px is the schedule coordinator for the utilities and handles payments to the iso for rt energy on behalf of the utilities ) . rather than shortpaying suppliers to the iso for defaults by the utilities on rt energy charges , the px attempted to collect this money from its participants in order to pay the iso - - that is sellers into the px day ahead market were supposed to pay sce ' s and pg & e ' s rt iso bill . this was done via a chargeback . this led to our " last man standing " theory , whereby the px would iteritively chargebacks until a few credit - worthy entities were stuck with pg & e and sce ' s defaults in both the px and iso markets . ferc granted market participants some relief on friday . they directed the px to ( 1 ) rescind all chargebacks and ( 2 ) refrain from taking any future chargebacks . they found " the chargeback provision in the px tariff was not designed to address default of this magnitude and , thus , its application in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable . " this is not the last word on this matter . there are a variety of state court cases that impact this , and , of course the bankruptcy judge will weigh in as well . however , this is a solid victory for us as ferc has sided with us rather than the px with respect to interpreting the px tariff for defaults .

2	Subject: option on employment contract like you , i am getting very frustrated with this process . i am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible . i am not trying to " hold up " the deal at the last minute . i ' m afraid that i am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company ( i don ' t mean the two of you - - i mean enron ) has screwed me and the people who work for me . i am generally ok with the concept of the option , the doc , and comp parameters . in addition , i need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven ' t received them and i need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure . it is unlikely that i would be here today if it weren ' t for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001 . i have received assurances from the two of you , oxley , and greg at different times as to the security of the comp received . the messages generally start with " it ' s safe , " " don ' t worry about it , " " all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate , " " low probability that there will be any issues , " . . . . at other times , particularly when you want me to commit to this deal , the logic changes . the comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if i ' m on the team . while i recognize that enron is a very strange and fluid place these days , it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do . when i ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table - - a non - starter . why ? because the estate is negotiating the deal . then have them negotiate that on behalf of me . because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate . i wouldn ' t be here but for the legacy issues with the estate - - it is definitely the buyer ' s issue ! because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee . i am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate / the buyer have time . because we don ' t know who from the buyer to negotiate with . someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues - - why not figure it out now . because this deal is bigger than tim belden . i ' m not delusional . i know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts . if it ' s bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me . since i am not " on the team " right now , i am also working with a great deal less information than you have . i respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people " on the team " versus not " on the team . " however , the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind . for example , i have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done , conveyed to the creditors / buyer / estate / judge works . louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them . if that ' s the case , you could add my indemnification amount ( adjusted by probability of payout ) to that total and it surely wouldn ' t blow up the deal . unless , the probability of payout is high . furthermore , i am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc ( subject to comment from my lawyer , but i ' ll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum ) . i am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer . at that point in time , i would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc . perhaps at that time , some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier . based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks i have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent . i don ' t understand why this is a non - starter issue , but i don ' t have the same information that you do . to be clear , here is the basic deal that i am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer : the deal as it exists plus retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them . indemnification of 2001 comp up to $ 4 million . i expect that the two of you will tell me that i ' m not on the team , that 800 people are going home , and that the portland office will be moved to houston if this thing survives . that is not what i want to happen . if this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn ' t happen . i have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions . i am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have . in talking through this stuff with mike and matt i realize what a hard position you guys are in . i feel that i have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days . i trust that you are trying to do the right thing . there are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time . finally , i apologize for hanging up on louise ealier . it ' s probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what i was about to say . i will call to see that you received and read this e - mail . i am comfortable with whatever you decide to do . tim

2	Subject: can you believe this ? you can make the difference at around 5 a . m . , helicopters circled our village . later , four men wearing sudanese military uniforms who had arrived on camels , horses and by cars entered our house and took some of our properties , then set the house on fire . i was forced to flee with my four children to a nearby bush . my husband had fled first for fear that he might be killed . some of the men who were caught unawares were chained together and burnt alive in a marketplace . of the 300 families from my village , about 25 people were killed and about 15 wounded . my sister , in her bid to run away from the attackers was shot and killed , along with her 3 - year - old daughter . in an attempt to escape the ordeal , we were captured and taken away by the attackers in khaki and in civilians ? clothes , along with dozens of other girls , and had to walk for eight hours . during the day , we were beaten up and were taken to a place in the bush and raped several times . for three days , we did not receive food and almost no water . after five days , our attackers had to move to another place and set us free . with no place to call our home we moved into a refugee camp in farchana , chad , supported by the united nations . since early 2003 , tens of thousands of sudanese citizens who live in the darfur region have been systematically killed , raped , and displaced as their villages have been destroyed . through coordinated land and air attacks ; the burning of homes and crops ; the rounding up of livestock ; the destruction of wells , granaries , and irrigation works ; the uprooting of trees ; and the theft of all possessions , the government of sudan and the government - supported arab militia , janjaweed , have displaced more than 1 million people . the united nations and other humanitarian agencies have been trying to support us in their various capacities but this has not been enough . to give assistance to these bodies , we have formed an organization of darfur displaced women association ( association de femmes d?plac?e par darfur ) . our finances come from individuals who have human feelings and are sympathetic to our plight . our children need education , rehabilitation , food and clothing . your contribution , no matter how little , can make the difference . azine zado ( chief co - ordinator ) association de femmes d?plac?e par darfur boulevard sao quartier moursal mdjamena , chari baguirmi 1887

2	Subject: investment / partnership proposal dear sir , i am mr . femi olugbade , a bank executive . i am sending this message to you in confidence . i am asking for your favor in the transfer of some money belonging to one mr barry kelly ( deceased ) whose death we were not aware of until we no longer got reply to our routine notifications to his forwarding address . we were however told by his employers , that he died from an automobile crash . now all attempts to trace his next of kin has proved abortive . there is however no trace in any of his official documents of a next of kin . the basic line here is that at the expiration of 6 years , the money will revert to the ownership of the government . nobody is ever coming to claim this money having spent 5 and a half years in our bank . so all i am asking from you is that you should stand in as his next of kin to avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt government officials . also note that , it is impossible for the money to leave the coffers of the bank without a next of kin , who also must be a foreigner . further workings of this initiative , and a sharing ratio , plus possible areas of investment will be discussed as soon as i hear from you . best regards . femi olugbade

" the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers , cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework , " stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad international inc . the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , 00 o , 0 oo users of the internet . of the total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 4 o , 0 oo , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore represents approximately 80 % of the entire internet connectivity market . the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher . nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration , but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product . about nomad international inc . nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl , cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii many of you are already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade monday ! go ndin . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 30 oo dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been wrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in the sub ject to ournewsletter 24 @ yahoo . com

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 . among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned . demands , demands rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely . if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade . friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition . this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the " market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . " he added : " it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . " mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity . under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb by christopher edmonds special to thestreet . com 10 / 26 / 2001 05 : 08 pm edt url : while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness . what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , " i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . " peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding . the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes . now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation . the company ' s challenge but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks . " our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , " says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . " we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . " dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . " it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline . there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , " why ? ask why . " investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer . first things first many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade . the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family . enjoy your weekend with family and friends . dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default 2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york ) by kristen mcnamara of dow jones newswires new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday . the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from new england ' s market . but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the past , the market ' s rulemaker said . " i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants " that have defaulted on their credit agreements , " and it ' s never been in the news , " said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s electricity market . " my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . " news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . " clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , " mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said . " i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance , " doot said . " those things have in fact happened from time to time .

gas pipelines . that allowed enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books . the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has said . few answers investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a conference call tuesday . today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to questions about one of them , es power 3 llc . texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire enron board is also listed . shares of enron $ 1 . 15 to $ 15 . 20 in late trading . -

- enron corp . , facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a target of investigations and lawsuits in california . california lawmakers and regulators have accused power providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers have denied the charges repeatedly . next month , a california senate committee investigating the power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento , california . ` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said . the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers . ` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to a speedy resolution .

' ' ' lockyer later apologized for the remark . the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power providers might be filed . ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that slowed things down a bit .

' ' though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for seven years . a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value of enron investors ' stock . partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets . other liabilities if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt . one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would thin out the holdings of every other investor . of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' ' one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - .

2	Subject: cutoff time for eol gas transactions i talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago , and this topic got pushed aside due to some other pressing issues . however , each of you agreed that a standard cutoff time was acceptable for us gas , power and liquids products . the best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4 pm each day ( just to get an idea of the numbers we were talking about , i looked at yesterday to determine how many deals were traded after 4 pm houston time . we had three us gas deals , and two canadian gas deals ) . after 4 pm , the bridges would automatically roll new eol deals to the next day . however , for those deals that do not bridge after 4 pm , the various risk groups would need to remember that these deals are the following day ' s business . i am not sure how the procedures in risk would need to be modified for the trader ' s position reports , as the official books would not include these late deals . can risk run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions each morning ? i would appreciate any comments that you may have , and regardless , please re - confirm that a cutoff of 4 pm works for each of your respective groups . sheri x 36557 mike - any potential problems with the dpr ? peggy - we discussed briefly a few weeks back . . . any thoughts ?

2	Subject: fw : abs pres louise - while we were looking at opportunities for offline and the value proposition a potential software vendor might make to banks , we stumbled across " asset backed securities " and its complete lack of market making . it appears to be a very large market , controlled by " dealers " who control issuance of abs commercial paper , and among themselves control an informal secondary market . given the size of the market , and the players who seek to issue the paper ( ge , siemen , ford , credit card companies , etc . ) , i was curious as to how enron would view the opportunity . my original intention for this piece was to talk to a bank or two about how they might use our system to do this themselves and outmanuever the " controlling dealers " . also a firm has opened for business that purports to bypass the " issuance process " at a much lower cost , but has no way to help a secondary market along . if we could work with them on a " secondary market " , perhaps this could evolve . we have had some positive feedback from rahil , brandon , and tom gros but i thought you might provide an overall corporate view ! thanks - david - - - - - original message - - - - - from : knop , kara sent : friday , april 06 , 2001 9 : 27 am to : berberian , david subject : abs pres david , per our discussion , attached is the latest presentation . regards , kara

2	Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00 1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week . ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities , and the state are likely to resume . a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency . yet the legislation also says " the authority may issue bonds , exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project . " the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding . 2 . default update 3 . bush as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved

( intensively tutoring my daughter for her first semester economics finals at rice . she certainly should have gotten a better looking tutor . ) that will make it very easy to come by and finalize whatever needs to be finalized with you that week . with her in houston , i spend a good bit of time there . look for the stuff in the next day or two . i look forward to working with you and your colleagues . thanks dale - - - - - original message - - - - - from : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com [ mailto : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com ] sent : monday , november 27 , 2000 10 : 44 am to : dale . nesbitt @ worldnet . att . net cc : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com subject : re : marketpoint license agreement dale , thanks for your message . in our phone conversation before the meeting you mentioned another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company employees on a case - study . the cost of a weekly project would be $ 12 , 000 that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software . this project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model internally . please , let me know more about this option . we are primarily interested in a long - term natural gas model and the database for north america . unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite , we don ' t have resources to spend too much time on it . of course , a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model . i shall talk to them about it . vince " dale m . nesbitt " on 11 / 13 / 2000 06 : 00 : 05 pm to : , " vince . j . kaminski " cc : subject : marketpoint license agreement john / vince : i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people . as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire bundled product , which includes ? north american gas , short and long term ? north american electricity , short and long term ? world gas ? western european gas ? world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business . as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under the fully bundled price . i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from marketpoint ' s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to " scale up " to another model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward . ) i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business . if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar . our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar . thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later . thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted . dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc . 27121 adonna ct . los altos hills , ca 94022 ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com ( see attached file : license . doc )

" we do not believe there is a high probability of a bailout offer at a price significantly above the current price , as there is too much uncertainty about the capital structure and shareholder lawsuits , " says jeff dietert , independent power analyst at simmons & co . , a houston energy investment firm and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . ? many metrics suggest the stock is inexpensive . merrill lynch analyst donato eassey recently calculated enron ' s asset value to be between $ 16 and $ 24 per share , which may make enron ' s current price of less than $ 12 look cheap . but in nearly the same breath , eassey downgraded enron stock to neutral from " accumulate . " merrill lynch has provided banking services for enron . ? " while we have not altered our view of enron ' s fundamentals or its ability to weather this long - term storm , from a practical standpoint we believe noise surrounding the sec ' s move to a formal investigation will outweigh any [ earnings ] analysis or net asset value calculation , " eassey told clients in a report thursday . ? for buffett : intriguing but . . . ? reports that famed value investor warren buffett is looking at enron may be correct . he is an opportunistic investor and has an interest in the power business . and , berkshire ' s ownership of mid - american energy provides a platform for an enron deal . ? however , interest and action are two different things . while buffett has said he wants additional power holdings , he seems more focused on the traditional , regulated utilities rather than the more aggressive opportunities represented by enron . buffett ' s track record shows he craves certainty and that is something enron can ' t provide , especially now . ? there are also pragmatic issues . if enron considered a deal , it would have to be one that was both rich and immediate , something buffett can ' t offer . constrained by the public utility holding company act , or puhca , berkshire might not be able to purchase enron until the sale of portland general , the oregon utility , is completed sometime next year . ? the enron culture could also keep buffett away . enron is well known for its employee stock option program that made millions of dollars for people like ex - ceo jeffrey skilling while creating little value for shareholders . buffett is a tireless critic of such shenanigans . buffett also generally looks for companies with a management team committed to remaining in place , and ken lay has no desire to remain at the helm of enron for the long haul , and future leadership is uncertain . ? and while buffett still may take a look , price could be the ultimate stumbling block . " i think he understands the derivative trading business better than most , " says robert hagstrom , portfolio manager of the legg mason focus trust and author of the essential buffett : timeless principles for the new economy . " i wouldn ' t be surprised if it ' s caught his eye , but i don ' t think he would get his price . he won ' t pay a premium for enron . " ? as for buffett , he won ' t comment on anything , let alone rumors like this . ? shell : burned out on gas ? ? another rumored suitor is royal dutch shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) . speculation has escalated to the point of suggesting that shell and enron have signed a confidentiality agreement to allow for exchange of privileged financial data . ? a shell spokeswoman in london would not comment on the speculation . an enron spokesman also declined to comment . ? shell wants to expand its gas business and in its bid for barrett resources , showed it will pay a premium for the right assets . ? but enron is more an energy trading company than an exploration and production company . shell ' s problems growing both its coral trading subsidiary and its tejas gas unit - - a costly acquisition - - probably would make it shy away from going there again , dietert says . ? shell and enron are very different companies , he adds . " culturally , it ' s a tough deal to imagine . " ? ge capital : enlightened investor ? ? the final name bandied about is ge capital . this one is more difficult to figure , but an investment in enron by the finance unit of general electric isn ' t out of the question . however , sources tell me an outright bid is unlikely . ? " they are a potential investor , " says dietert . " if push comes to shove , enron would be willing to issue 30 % to 40 % more equity rather than face bankruptcy . and , ge capital could participate in such a deal .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ? ? san francisco , nov 2 ( reuters ) - if there ' s one market that might applaud the mounting financial woes facing energy giant enron corp . , it ' s california , whose power sector was shattered by the market deregulation that enron tirelessly champions . ? last summer , angry californians tossed a pie at enron ex - chief executive jeff skilling during a speech here in which he blamed state regulators for causing the energy crisis . ? california officials , led by governor gray davis , blasted houston - based enron and other out - of - state power companies for creating the emergency , accusing them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices . ? but with enron now facing a credit crunch and a full - scale probe by u . s . regulators into questionable financial dealings , california officials are holding back their harshest criticism , saying instead there are lessons to be learned from enron ' s predicament . ? and some of enron ' s toughest critics , among them davis and loretta lynch , president of the state ' s public utilities commission ( cpuc ) , would not discuss the company ' s woes . ? " you reap what you sow , but i don ' t think anyone wants to pile on them right now , " said a state government source . ? many californians cited ongoing business and creditor links with enron as reasons not to hurl stones at the energy giant . ? enron is by far the nation ' s largest trader of electricity and natural gas , with energy analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets . ? transactions on the company ' s widely watched internet - based enrononline trading system are estimated currently to average $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day . ? ' business cycles ' ? " business cycles come and go , " said greg pruett , spokesman for san francisco - based energy company pg & e corp . , whose pacific gas & electric unit , california ' s biggest utility , filed for federal bankruptcy protection in april in the wake of the energy mess . ? " we are wrestling with our own situation , and you can appreciate what enron is going through . we have done business with enron for a long time and will continue to do business with them in the future , " pruett said . ? california ' s power agencies , forced into buying emergency electricity for the state earlier this year when the state ' s investor - owned utilities ran out of credit and cash , said they have financial ties with enron . ? " their situation is not ringing alarm bells for us , " said gregg fishman , a spokesman for the independent system operator ( iso ) , which manages the state power grid . ? the iso owes enron money for purchases of daily power supplies but fishman declined to say how much . ? aside from a 30 - day supply contract earlier this year , enron does not have any current power deals with the state ' s department of water resources , said oscar hidalgo , spokesman for the agency which negotiates long - term agreements . ? one top california energy regulator , however , said enron ' s troubles offer an important lesson for energy markets . ? carl wood , a cpuc commissioner , said the deregulation of markets for basic services like electricity " threatens as much financial volatility and instability as we have seen in the telecommunications and the dot - com industries . " ? wood said , " enron is the flagship for deregulation , but there are definite dangers of venturing into unregulated market behavior . enron itself apparently is becoming a victim of sorts . our largest utility is in bankruptcy . one obvious conclusion is to keep the energy industry on a pretty short regulatory leash . " ? " the unregulated energy industry rises faster , but it also falls further , " said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayers and consumer rights , an advocacy group in santa monica , california . ? " it ' s okay for a free market to operate for things like computers and other goods but energy is different . regulatory structures are needed to protect customers , " he said . ? ? copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . ? ? enron portland genl sale seen going smoothly this time ? by jessica berthold ? of dow jones newswires ? ? 11 / 02 / 2001 ? dow jones energy service ?

2	Subject: class speaker vincent , we met last year when you were visiting the university , and talking primarily with our finance faculty . as you may have heard , i tried to call to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real options from your group at enron . naturally , i would be delighted if you could speak , but i could also appreciate the possibility that someone else might also be a good choice . i have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information . this is the first time this course has been offered at ut , and i was motivated to do so because of the " buzz " regarding the topic in industry . i have about 30 mba students in the class , many of whom were in the energy finance classes offered by sheridan titman and ehud ronn ( both of whom have been very supportive of the development of this class ) . my own background is decision analysis rather than finance , so i tend to approach the topic with that perspective . as you can see , i have covered both traditional decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature . at the present time , i don ' t think there is a really complete textbook that fits the course at the mba level , so i ' ve tried to focus on how to do things in practice , and have provided software ( dpl , spreadsheets , @ risk , etc ) as tools for the students to use . the course is scheduled on thursday afternoons from 3 : 30 to 6 : 30 , which is a time that i chose to make possible the participation of some executive mba students from houston ( 3 are participating ) . i look forward to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker , or any other suggestions that you might have . james s . dyer fondren centennial chair in business department of management science and information systems cba 5 . 202 the university of texas at austin austin , texas 78712 - 1175 email : j . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu telephone : 512 - 471 - 5278 fax : 512 - 471 - 0587

2	Subject: canfibre we have an agreement in principle for a resolution of our investment entanglement at canfibre riverside and canfibre lackawanna : there will be no draw on the $ 4 . 5 million enron obligation to fund lackawanna based upon acceptance tests . any such funding would have benefited only the senior lenders at this facility ( of which we are not one ) . there will be complete release of enron and subsidiaries for any claims , including underwriters ' liability relating to enron ' s promotion and sale of the lackawanna bonds . this release will cover any current or past contracts or agreements at any time related to our investment and ownership . it does not include potential claims on the power contract at riverside that was terminated when that company went into bankruptcy . this contract could not be included since all the unsecured creditors at riverside are stakeholders . enron will receive $ 250 k in cash . in return : enron will assign the canfibre loans and the stock of the canfibre group to the senior bondholders . enron ' s investment in the loans and stock included in this deal were written - off totally last year . we were facing an additional potential write - off of $ 4 . 5 million this year relating to the lackawanna additional funding . in addition to the $ 4 . 8 million hard - dollar recovery , this transaction avoids a very real , substantial potential liability due to enron ' s heavy involvement ( and specific underwriting of lackawanna ) in the two canfibre deals in which well in excess of $ 200 million investment ( over $ 150 million of which came from third parties ) was lost in two catastrophic financial disasters . richard sanders has confirmed that getting rid of any claim on underwriters ' liability has significant value in this situation . we avoid continuing to incur substantial legal and professional expenses over a prolonged period . we terminate significant commercial and legal time and effort that is much more productively reassigned elsewhere . if the deal is closed , i view this resolution as a grandslam home run in the bottom of the ninth . through a barrage of analyses and negotiation , john enerson managed to create some leverage where none existed that eventually forced the canfibre bondholders into finally recognising that we were more than ready to fight them aggressively on every issue by all means available and bring them to the table . in the end we got virtually everything we could possibly have obtained under any reasonable scenario . john has handled this deal with creativity and persistence and deserves credit for orchestrating a very sensitive situation . wayne mays from technical services provided key engineering support . the documentation and closing of this transaction is scheduled to occur early next week . normally i would wait for closing to report success . since this deal was put together very rapidly , however , i wanted time to clarify any questions that might arise prior to final execution . of course , given that the status is agreement in principle , there is always the chance ( we believe it is highly unlikely ) that the deal could fall apart .

2	Subject: end of year venture from : tukur mana , federal secretariat complex , ikoyi . email : t _ mana @ fsmail . net best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter . before going into details of my proposal to you , i must first solicit you to treat this with utmost confidentiality , as this is required for its success . introduction : my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of nigeria  s contracts review panel who are interested in investing some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the central bank of nigeria . in order to commence this transaction , we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating funds . we are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2003 . the source of the funds are as follows : during the last military regime , government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over - invoiced to contractors . the present civilian government set up the contract review panel , which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel , to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts . my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the central bank of nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to invest some of it for our own purposes . however , by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel , we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in nigeria . i have therefore been mandated , as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel , to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of sixteen million , five hundred thousand u . s . dollars that is why i am writing you this letter . we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account , if you agree with our proposition as follows ; ( i ) 10 % to the account owner ( you ) . ( ii ) 80 % for us ( the panel officials ) . ( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by both you and us ) incidental to the actualisation of this project . we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please note that this transaction is 100 % safe . we intend to effect the transfer within fourteen ( 14 ) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information : your name , company  s name , address , telephone and fax numbers . the above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively . this way , we will use your company  s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company . we are looking forward to carrying out this transaction with you and we solicit your utmost confidentiality in its execution . please acknowledge the receipt of this email by replying urgently . also , endeavour to furnish me with your phone number so that i can call you and bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when i hear from you . best regards , dr tukur mana . please send your replies to me on my alternative mail address : t _ mana @ fsmail . net

2	Subject: how about your good self ? good evening . all our final decisions are made in a state of mind that is not going to last . the vitality of a new movement in art must be gauged by the fury it arouses . the man who has accomplished all that he thinks worthwhile has begun to die . when you are aspiring to the highest place , it is honorable to reach the second or even the third rank . there is a fellowship more quiet even than solitude , and which , rightly understood , is solitude made perfect . frustrated love has been the incentive for many great works . spinoza experience keeps a dear school , but fools will learn in no other . have an aim in life - - then don ' t forget to pull the trigger . all bodies are slow in growth but rapid in decay . our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men . one must verify or expel his doubts , and convert them into the certainty of yes or no . the gambling known as business looks with severe disfavor on the business known as gambling . none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves . ' tis the old secret of the gods that they come in low disguises . the more anger towards the past you carry in your heart , the less capable you are of loving in the present . if you find a path with no obstacles , it probably doesn ' t lead anywhere . happiness is not a state to arrive at , rather , a manner of traveling . charity is injurious unless it helps the recipient to become independent of it . i ' ve got to keep breathing . it ' ll be my worst business mistake if i don ' t . the dog that trots about finds a bone . history is just the portrayal of crimes and misfortunes . civilization is a limitless multiplication of unnecessary necessities . god always has another custard pie up his sleeve . the itch of disputing is the scab of the churches . when you ' ve got something to prove , there ' s nothing greater than a challenge . niganisabye - bye  
2	Subject: the procedure there are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a password application : 1 ) direct knowledge of the individual signing . the energy community is relatively small . in most cases , we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past . 2 ) ostensible authority . 3 ) 3 rd party verification . for 3 rd party verification , the following procedure is used after credit , legal and contracts departments have approved the counterparty for online transactions : ? the main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the trading department is requested ? a vice president or director of trading is requested for verification of the pa signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to master agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes . the company is informed that the phone call is being recorded . ? date , name , title and phone number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places : 1 ) access tracking database and 2 ) online trading operations control form and 3 ) recorded telephone conversation . the master user id is forwarded to the customer only upon the verification of the authority of the applicant .
