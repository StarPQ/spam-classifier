2	Subject: california power update 1 / 17 / 01 pt . iii 1 . california ag exploring investigation of power profits sources report that the california attorney general ' s office , in a meeting yesterday , ordered a review of the federal profiteering statute . in keeping with the recent rhetoric by gov . davis , this action is almost certainly directed toward investigations of profits made by generators and marketers . 2 . more detail on bankruptcy - creditors concerned about lengthy " cure period " the generators want to limit their exposure as general creditors in a chapter 11 proceeding . their ability to their exposure depends on the " cure period " for making good on a defaulted payment , which would be dictated by the specific contract terms . if the " cure period " - that is , the time the utilities have available to make up for missed payments before the generators or the power exchange can take them to court - is a short period of time , for the sake of argument 30 days , then the utilities ' creditors have to swallow another 30 days of accumulated ( impaired ) receivables before they can move to the more desirable position of postpetition suppliers ( in which bills do get paid , as would be directed by the bankruptcy court judge ) . if , however , the utilities have a longer " cure period " , for the sake of argument 60 days , then their creditors will effectively have to swallow 60 days of accumulated impaired receivables on which they will ultimately have to take a substantial haircut .

2	Subject: message for peace and reconciliation an open letter to muslims only ( a message for peace and reconciliation ) dear brothers and sisters , god forbid if any one of our near one and dear one is killed then the killer is evil , a beast and what not and should get penalty but if one among us kills anybody then he is not evil and we start finding justifications behind killing . . . . double standards ? being muslims , many of our brothers and sisters are not working for peace . they are misguided , mistaken and spreading the virus of hatred and revenge through disinformation and false accusations , which is resulting in death and miseries for number of innocent people living around the world at the hands of merciless killer muslims and also bringing bad name to mohammed ( pbuh ) who never killed anyone in his life time . instead of teaching about good evil , certain radical muslim clerics are only trading in religion . they teach us about accusing , abusing and killing the non - muslims . they try to hypnotize us to hate and kill the non - muslims and brethren of other sects or be killed and without using any common sense , we readily believe in whatever is being said by these hate mongers . actually , they are agents of satan who is paying them heavily and in return they are cutting at the very roots of the ummah . instead of mourning most of the muslims are rejoicing on the brutal killings of the non - combatant innocent civilians and the murderers have always been our great heroes . before it is too late and the curse of god falls upon us , we should use common sense , find out the truth and wakeup to save muslims from becoming the most hated , isolated , discredited and suspicious people in the world . we must start working for promoting sectarian harmony and religious tolerance in the society and should prove to the world through our deeds that mohammed ( pbuh ) teaches love peace and not gangsterism , terrorism , extremism , sectarianism , cruelty , inhumanity and hatred killing of the innocent civilians . islam is a religion of peace . islam teaches respect and love for all even the animals . but many narrow - minded muslims have so far failed to learn anything from the teachings of mohammed ( pbuh ) . we are far away from the basic principle of islam i . e . enjoining the people to do good and forbidding them from doing evil . unfortunately , most of us remember only one thing to be called as good muslims and that is to hate the non - muslims . the killing of others in the name of religion is a sin . can a father ever teach his children to be the permanent enemies of each other ? my prayer for peace : merciful god , please give to peoples of the world , the required wisdom and determination , to forgive and forget the bitterness of the past and learn to live in peace like brothers and sisters , by ending the divisions and hatreds created in us by our past and present elders . ( amen ) i seek your opinion to correct the situation . thanking you in advance , s . a . rehman peace activist for contact email : rehman 889 @ hotmail . com email . sarhmn 28 @ yahoo . com

2	Subject: a better investment than the stock market . all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet ! does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) . and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles . " my first thought was that he had robbed a bank " , says the 41 - year - old woman , " there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year " . the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of " report " to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . " i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out " , says the clever 15 - year - old . the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 - address list . " i get junk e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work " , the boy continues . within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills . " about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) " . he goes on , " i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all " . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . " the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework " . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . " i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . " surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . the reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called " chain - letter " the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , " please send me report number xyx " . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee . [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] . be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you say " bull " , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are " absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost " . due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained , it is currently working better than ever . note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible . this is what one had to say : " thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in " . pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey . here is another testimonial : " this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything .

there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : r . r . po box 18048 chicago , il 60618 report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net order report # 2 from : gm boland 353 jonestown rd . suite 125 winston salem , nc 27104 report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : r . chernick po box 771661 c . s . florida 33077 report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . eiseman po box 451971 sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971 report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : l . samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5 xp $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do .  orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + more testimonials + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + " my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago . i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving " junk mail " . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i " knew " it wouldn ' t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old " i told you so " on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 , 200 . 00 . . . . all cash ! i was shocked . i have joined jody in her " hobby " . mitchell wolf , chicago , illinois " not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back " .

2	Subject: urgent news alert ( otcbb : agel ) news alert stock profile urgent news release about company investment highlights investment opportunity market and growth potential of online gaming it is estimated that in excess of a trillion dollars is wagered annually worldwide on the various forms of gambling . the growth of the internet has far exceeded the growth of any other communication medium in the 20 th century . in just under four years the internet has reached penetration rates that took the television 13 years to reach and the radio over 30 years . internet gambling has grown from 30 sites and bets of $ 17 million in 1996 to approximately $ 3 billion in wagers in the year 2000 , according to the center for policy initiatives a may 26 , 2002 article in thestreet . com noted that according to christiansen capital advisors , a new york consulting firm that tracks the gaming industry , gambling web sites took in $ 3 . 5 billion in revenue during 2001 . an april 29 , 2002 business week article noted that web surfers will wager an estimated $ 11 . 4 billion this year and that all over europe , internet surfers are visiting gambling and gaming sites in record numbers , helping online betting become one of the fastest growing businesses on the net . bear stearns anticipates an estimated $ 6 billion in revenues by u . s . wagerers alone , by 2003 . a press release put out by aspinalls , a leading online gambling operator , indicated that international online gambling revenues were set to grow to $ 20 . 8 billion in 2005 , based upon an extensive research report put out by greenfield online . research firm datamonitor forecasts that revenues from gambling will soar to $ 20 . 8 billion by 2005 . while the u . s . has been the dominant market for the internet to date , statistics from nua ltd . indicate that approximately 25 percent of internet users are from europe and 15 percent are from the asia pacific . estats , inc . , on online provider and assembler of the internet research , believes that the major international growth areas will be in europe , led by germany , the uk , sweden , france , asia / pacific rim , especially japan , australia , taiwan , and new zealand . western europe , with 14 million people online , accounting for 18 % of the worlds total , represents the next big growth opportunity of the net . asia , led by japan , is a booming market for online users , e - commerce and advertising dollars . estats , inc . further estimates that asia and the pacific rim region hold 8 million of the worlds net users , nearly 11 % of the worlds total . according to paul budde communications the online population in asia , estimated at 5 to 10 million , comprises only 0 . 4 % of the total population in that region . due to the population of asia versus its lack of online household penetration , the long - term potential for growth is astronomical . the baker report was quoted as saying , we believe our projections of internet gambling revenues of us $ 100 to us $ 200 billion domestically and us $ 200 to us $ 400 billion in the rest of the world by 2005 is reasonable , even conservative . in an aug . 1 prnewswire - first call press release - angelciti entertainment , inc . announced that it will be initiating operations of a chinese based language online casino , and will be adding additional asian - language - based websites , entering asia ' s multi - billion dollar gaming market . additional growth potential it is universally agreed that the next big evolution is the adaptation of the wireless internet and most professionals predict this will occur over the next several years . moreover , online gambling has continued to grow internationally as even more people gain access to the internet . these events will materially increase our opportunities to reach the gaming public and convert even more users toward angelcitis licensed casinos . with regard to wireless growth , angelcitis licensed casinos can acquire more online game time from users waiting to catch their planes , which are delayed for appointments , and the like , by providing them with the easy use of our entertainment over their cell phone or wireless pda . moreover , they can acquire additional users in the form of computer phobic people who feel perfectly comfortable using their mobile phone . we strongly feel that the next generation of wireless products will serve to only further fuel the meteoric growth of the online gaming industry and that angelcitis licensed casinos will enjoy the fruits of that evolution . the market for online gaming in europe and asia has been growing even more rapidly than the us market an in a april 29 , 2002 business week article noted that all over europe , internet surfers are visiting gambling and gaming sites in record numbers , helping online betting become one of the fastest growing businesses on the net . and yet the online casino providers catering to these markets have grown more slowly than those servicing english - speaking countries . to keep up with growing international demand , angelciti has plans to bring out online casinos in spanish , german , french and chinese within the next 6 months and will explore adding on additional languages as those markets continue to grow . angelciti has also expressed a strategy of maximizing its marketing capabilities by bringing on specialists familiar with those regions who can help us to optimize our website design and marketing efforts with a special local flavor tailor -

" as a company with a global presence , returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel . the faa has already implemented strengthened security measures for u . s . airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe , secure , and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public . we encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules . we have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time , although we strongly recommend - - in conjunction with the u . s . department of state - - that all travel to afghanistan , yemen , pakistan , indonesia , iran , iraq , sudan , somalia , tajikistan , turkmenistan , georgia , and the kyrgyz republic be canceled . in addition , we recommend that planned travel to egypt , israel , gaza / west bank , jordan , lebanon , saudi arabia , syria , and algeria be very carefully considered . employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http : / / home . enron . com under the " international travel " section of the corporate security website . all u . s . - based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through travel agency in the park at ( 713 ) 650 - 8080 or ( 800 ) 962 - 0248 . other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance .

2	Subject: template for pricing the right of first refusal shelley and chris , i have set up a template for pricing rofrs . the rofr is priced as a series forward start options . a forward start option gives the holder the right to exercise the option but the strike price is set at the money in future before the option expiration . the feature mimics the " matching the best bid " in the rofr . the underlying for the option is the " best bid " , which should be closely related to the price differential between the two hubs that the pipeline connects . therefore the rofr is case dependent , as vince pointed out . the volatility can be estimated from the " best bid " price history . with these inputs we can estimate the value of rofr . if you have any questions concerning the model please feel free to call me or vince . zimin lu

2	Subject: re : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hit sorry to hear about this one . i have some observations to make from my reading ( and re - reading ) of the account : 1 it looks like the old " undue influence " problem again . it seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up , but nothing happened . we tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don ' t have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career . and that is because twice a year , at the prc , that can happen . this incident shows some of these attributes . for the operations process to be effective there has to be ( and be seen to be ) little significant influence from commercial groups over the ranking of the operations staff . 2 whoever signed off the new deal lists in the dpr should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it . 3 why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? brokerage is in the p & l and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate , they should simply pay the brokerage . 4 two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same day . i would not have waited for the traders to do it , but i would want to know why it took them so long . 5 given that these ( short ) trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices , i would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time . essentially , if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did . i would pursue explanations to points 2 , 4 and 5 . dp fernley dyson @ ect 06 / 12 / 2000 02 : 41 am to : james new / lon / ect @ ect cc : richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , robert yeo / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , brent a price / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hit james , thanks for the note . as described , this is an intolerable situation . i agree your action points , but we need timelines and quantitative measures of compliance / improvement - please could you provide a weekly update on this area specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they should be . on a more general note - let ' s ensure that the ' global standards ' address the lapses in timely action / follow - up identified here so that we can monitor performance across the business . fernley james new 09 / 06 / 2000 10 : 03 to : richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect cc : robert yeo / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect subject : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hit on the 7 th of june gas risk management became aware that two ' late ' trades had been entered into the gas trader ' s ' blue book ' which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative p & l impact ( negative ol . 1 m ) . the ' late ' deals were done on the 3 rd of february ( marcello romano ) and the 30 th of march ( haakon olafson ) and were both forward starting sells for periods in 2003 - 2004 . background 1 ) input errors for some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the gas area with the most significant number coming form the uk gas traders . numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the ' blue book ' ( the gas traders are currently the only traders in europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support of john sherriff with a deadline date of 31 july ) . in the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen . a log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of may which highlights an error rate of 12 % - 15 % of non eol trades . this has been discussed with richard lewis and corrective action is expected . 2 ) deal booking and reconciliation process ( non eol trades ) deals are initially written into the ' blue book ' by the gas traders when the deal is done . this book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into gasdesk by documentation on the same day . faxed broker statements are received ( usually ) by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to gasdesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary . at this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade ( relevant later ) . 3 ) new deal sign off as part of the daily dpr process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination p invoice received before 15 march as settlements started checking it . ( keren perrott - settlements started on 13 march ) discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 may ( chris ware to emma thomson ) traders contacted on 24 may after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 may as requested by documentation to prove deal . deal entered 6 june after traders checked the tapes . ieb broker - np trade on 30 mar 2000 trader haakon ieb invoice date 6 april ; invoice received before 27 april as settlements started checking it . ( keren perrott ) discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 may ( chris ware to robert vaughn ) traders contacted on 24 may after copy of broker confirm was requested . deal entered 6 june after traders checked the tapes . who was at fault and where did the control break down ? i do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn . firstly there are major concerns over the gas trader ' s accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades . despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen . it has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it . this is now being communicated to richard lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running dprs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this . the current error rate is 12 % - 15 % of non eol trades . documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct . secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived . most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade . reconciliation ' s of these daily statements to gasdesk are evidenced . thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously ( and by mail ) errors and omissions on a more timely basis . there is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders . this is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment . action points trading traders to input their own deals directly into gasdesk traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis trade support settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements all follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from july 2000 to september 2006 ( the traded part of the curve )

2	Subject: enron mentions - 11 / 19 / 01 headed for a fall ; companies issued special zero - coupon bonds , assuming they ' d never have to pay them off . now shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab . fortune magazine , 11 / 26 / 01 manager ' s journal : what enron did right the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 j . p . morgan wins ( by not losing as much ) the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 german bank is in talks with enron to buy a unit the new york times , 11 / 19 / 01 bond boom isn ' t likely to lift economy as corporations swap old debt for new the wall street journal , 11 / 19 / 01 preview / week of nov . 19 - 25 investors looking for answers in enron filing los angeles times , 11 / 19 / 01 companies companies issued special zero - coupon bonds , assuming they ' d never have to pay them off . now shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab . janice revell 11 / 26 / 2001 fortune magazine time inc . 131 ( copyright 2001 ) it was an irresistible proposition : borrow billions of dollars , pay no interest , reap millions in tax breaks , and then wait for the debt to simply disappear . that was the promise of zero - coupon convertible bonds , and companies from enron to merrill lynch binged on what seemed like free money . but , of course , there was a catch : for this scenario to play out , a company ' s stock price had to rise sharply - - and quickly . that ' s because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity - - if the stock tanked , the bonds would no longer be worth converting . so to make them more attractive to buyers , companies had to build in an escape hatch : if the stock price failed to rise sufficiently , investors could " put " ( that is , sell ) the bonds back to the company - - in many cases , after just one year . and that ' s exactly what ' s about to happen - - to the tune of some $ 65 billion over the next three years . stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these special hybrids , the prospect of conversion is now absurd . it simply won ' t happen . so bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can . and because of the put feature , that is possible . suddenly companies like tyco , comcast , and dozens more are on the hook for billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they ' d never have to pay . that could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies . after all , they ' re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due . huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders . companies without enough cash - - and the majority fall into this camp - - are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew . that means sharply reduced earnings . especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings - - prime candidates for killer refinancing costs . some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the debt , creating significant shareholder dilution , especially at current depressed prices . to make matters worse , this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking . " this is a ticking time bomb , " warns margaret patel , manager of the pioneer high yield bond fund , a top - performing junk fund . the seeds of this mess were sown in mid - 2000 , when the stock market started to falter . companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling . zero - coupon convertible bonds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn ' t have to make cash interest payments on the bonds ( hence the name " zero " ) . instead issuers offered an up - front discount - - for instance , investors would buy a bond for $ 700 and collect $ 1 , 000 when it matured . companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares . but the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price rose significantly - - in many cases , by more than 50 % . with that protective feature ( called the conversion premium ) , zeros took off . corporate issuers would pay no interest , and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels , the debt would be swept away into equity . " if the bonds are converted , it ' s a home run for everybody , " says jonathan cohen , vice president of convertible - bond analysis at deutsche bank . that four - bagger , of course , depends entirely on the stock price rising . if it doesn ' t , the bondholders , armed with that handy put feature , can simply sell the bonds back to the company . great for bondholders , but not so hot for the company or its shareholders . but , hey , what are the odds of that happening ? " cfos and ceos believe that their stock will just continue to go up , " says cohen . " they don ' t worry about the bond getting put . " if all this seems a little complicated , that ' s because it is . a real - life example should help . california - based electric utility calpine issued $ 1 billion in zeros in april to refinance existing debt . at the time , the company ' s stock was trading at about $ 55 a share - - severely undervalued in the opinion of company management . " we really didn ' t want to sell equity at that point , " says bob kelly , calpine ' s senior vice president of finance . so the company instead opted to sell zeros , setting the conversion premium at a hefty 37 % . still , with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile , the bonds weren ' t exactly a screaming buy for investors . so calpine added the put feature : investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price , eliminating any downside risk . things haven ' t exactly worked out as management had hoped . the stock has since plummeted to $ 25 , and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense . so it ' s looking as though calpine will be liable for the $ 1 billion in borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this april . there ' s also the refinancing cost . according to kelly , calpine ' s borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 8 . 5 % - - an extra $ 85 million per year in cash . " obviously , nobody plans for their stock to go down , " kelly says . " i don ' t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put . " calpine ' s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is straddling junk . " if you are a borderline investment - grade company , a financing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world , " notes anand iyer , head of global convertible research at morgan stanley . the problem is , there are a slew of companies with far worse credit ratings out there : jeff seidel , credit suisse first boston ' s head of convertible - bond research , estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category . and others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the put date . today , with junk yielding as much as 5 1 / 2 percentage points above bonds rated investment grade , refinancing can be a pricey proposition . contract manufacturer solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk . it has $ 845 million in zeros that it will probably have to buy back this january , and another $ 4 . 2 billion coming down the pike over the next couple of years . because of slower - than - expected sales , the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies . and if solectron ' s credit is downgraded , the zeros would slide into junk status , a situation that could cost the company - - and its shareholders - - tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges . refinancing isn ' t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros . companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds - - up to 3 % of the amount raised . if the debt is sold back , many will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a one - year loan . " they ' re getting bad advice , " claims one banker who didn ' t want to be named . " look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into . " as if those potential consequences were not scary enough , shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued . that ' s because some 40 % are bought by hedge funds , which short the company ' s stock ( sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price ) at the same time that they buy the bonds . if the stock goes down , the shorts make money from their position . if it goes up , they profit by converting the bond to stock . this hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet , at least for a while . grocery chain supervalu , for example , recently lost 10 % of its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $ 185 million in zeros . despite all the pitfalls , the love affair with such pollyanna bonds continues , thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide . in fact , the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing . even better , thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code , companies can rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they ' re actually paying . all they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail . verizon communications , for instance , would pay 0 . 25 % annual interest on its $ 3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls below 60 % of the issue ' s conversion price . in the eyes of the irs , oddly , that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction , for tax purposes , of 7 . 5 % - - the same rate it pays on its regular debt . ( why ? trust us , you don ' t want to know . ) that adds up to an annual deduction of more than $ 200 million , even if verizon never shells out a dime in interest . not surprisingly , more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain similar clauses . " it ' s an incredible deal for them , " says vadim iosilevich , who runs a hedge fund at alexandra investment management . " not only are they raising cheap money , they ' re also doing tax arbitrage .

" but creative destroyers are not necessarily likable , pleasant folks , which may be part of enron ' s problem today . - - minimization of transaction costs and frictions . enron extended the logic of de - integration to other industries . an integrated paper company , for instance , owns forests , mills , pulp factories , and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller , specialized firms . enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of " customers " and " suppliers . " enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free - market terms would be better than those of the internal operations . the development of free - market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy . - - exploiting the optionality in networks . in the old regulated environment , natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline . enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources , opening the customer to the benefits of competition , and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies . enron benefited from controlling switches on the network , so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use , and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons . this policy , picked up by others in the industry , created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers . - - rigorous risk assessment . the strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed , and of very strong internal controls . enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere . particularly with the advent of enron online , where enron made new positions valued at over $ 4 billion each day , it became essential to have up - to - the - second information on company - wide positions , prices and ability to deliver . the unexpected bad news from enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm , but with fears among trading partners about enron ' s ability to finance its trading activity . in a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite , counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance . it was the erosion in equity , rather than trading risk , that destroyed the firm . - - a culture of urgency , innovation and high expectations . enron ' s corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all . the hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic , hierarchical , formal , slow , and full of excuses . and the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company - - enron only 15 years ago - - is even duller and slower . enron became bumptious , impatient , lean , fast , innovative , and demanding . it bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses , create markets , and transfer within the firm . success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion , and an open - office design fostered brainstorming . the firm ' s organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs . this was a lightning rod for the firm ' s detractors . and yet , it could serve as a model for more hide - bound enterprises to emulate . enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of american business . it created a ruckus in once - quiet corners of the business economy . it rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business . it thrived on volatility . the proposed sale of enron to dynegy risks the loss of a major r & d establishment , especially given dynegy ' s track record as a second mover following enron ' s lead . beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time - consuming antitrust review , dynegy ' s greater challenge will be to find a way to make enron ' s spirit of innovation its own . or so we all should hope , because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries . - - - messrs . bodily and bruner are professors at the university of virginia ' s graduate school of business administration . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . j . p . morgan wins ( by not losing as much ) by susanne craig staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 19 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) you know things are bad on wall street when the winner of a stock - selection contest can ' t come close to breaking even . j . p . morgan chase & co . ' s portfolio was the only one in the wall street journal ' s quarterly stock - picking survey to slide less than 10 % during the three months ended sept . 30 . the value of its stock basket fell 8 . 6 % during the third quarter . just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index , which dropped 14 . 7 % during the period . among the star performers that came to j . p . morgan ' s rescue : northrop grumman corp . , sbc communications inc . and procter & gamble co . " it has turned into a real stock - picker ' s market , " says j . p . morgan equity strategist douglas cliggott . " in the first half , the market bought cyclical stocks , such as credit cards and brokers , in hopes of a recovery . we don ' t think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003 . " instead , the firm ' s portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples , as well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment . the quarter was among the roughest in years for wall street investors . the terrorist attacks of sept . 11 helped contribute to the stock - market losses , which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey , though the markets have since recovered to their pre - sept . 11 levels . the last time the group posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998 , during the asian financial crisis . goldman sachs group inc . and credit suisse group ' s credit suisse first boston finished at the bottom of the pack , falling 23 . 2 % and 30 . 1 % respectively . the performance of last - place finisher csfb was dragged down by losses at companies such as veritas software corp . ( down 72 . 3 % in the quarter ) , praecis pharmaceuticals inc . ( down 64 . 8 % ) and software provider amdocs ltd . ( down 51 % ) . for csfb , " it was not a good stock - picking quarter , that ' s for sure , " says al jackson , the firm ' s global head of equity research . " it was our tech and telecom . . . and the events of sept . 11 that hurt us . " credit suisse first boston recently changed the approach to its model portfolio , opting against sector weightings , mr . jackson says . this strategy has hurt csfb in recent quarters , because of the steep slump in areas such as technology and telecom . the firm recently added a number of old economy stocks to its portfolio , such as citigroup inc . , dow chemical co . and gannett co . says mr . jackson : " we are going back to our roots and asking what our best ideas are . " like csfb , goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology companies , such as check point software technologies ltd . ( down 56 . 5 % in the quarter ) . its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled enron corp . ( down 44 . 3 % ) . morgan stanley and royal bank of canada ' s rbc dain rauscher , which placed 6 th and 12 th respectively , also have the energy company on their lists . in addition to enron , stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks , such as lodging giant starwood hotels & resorts worldwide inc . , walt disney co . and airlines such as skywest inc . , also hurt the portfolio performance of many securities firms . it is unlikely people will buy any company ' s entire recommended list at one time . the journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how their portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking . calculations in the quarterly survey , done for the journal by zacks investment research in chicago , take into account capital gains or losses , dividends and theoretical commissions of 1 % on each trade . overall , edward d . jones & co . , of st . louis , emerged with the most consistent results across the board , placing second in the quarter and for the year . its 85 % return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the total return for the s & p 500 of 62 . 7 % . perhaps more than any other firm , edwards jones takes a buy - and - hold approach to investing , making very few changes to its portfolio from quarter to quarter , or even year to year . " it ' s the old story of the tortoise and the hare , and we believe slow and steady wins the race , " says david otto , edward jones director of research . " we are really , really proud of the five - year number . we believe in getting rich , slowly . " on a quarterly basis , the portfolio of prudential securities inc . , a unit of prudential financial , came in second only to j . p . morgan , falling 11 . 8 % . however , investors sitting with the stocks prudential recommends haven ' t done as well in the long run . the value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45 . 9 % in the past year , finishing ahead of only lehman brothers holdings inc . , which posted a one - year loss of 54 . 9 % . seven firms managed to beat the s & p 500 index during the past 12 months , which fell 26 . 6 % in the period . lehman , which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to its heavy weighting in technology , managed to move up in the rankings this quarter . this primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in its portfolio , known as its " ten uncommon values . " this time around , the firm ' s portfolio slipped 18 . 4 % in the quarter , for an 11 th place finish . just one of its 10 stocks , washington mutual inc . , managed to eke out a positive return , of 3 . 1 % . its biggest quarterly loser : energy company mirant corp . , which fell 36 . 3 % in the period .

' ' in hindsight , we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , told analysts in a conference call last week . those investments ' ' have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined , ' ' he said , citing the azurix water business , of which wessex water is a part , and energy assets in brazil and india . executives from enron were not immediately available for comment today . westlb executives declined to comment . westlb has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in britain , bidding for british telecommunications ' phone network and the nation ' s railway tracks controlled by the troubled railtrack , which is restructuring under government supervision . neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stages . last summer , westlb helped finance the management buyout of the mid kent water company through swan capital , its private equity vehicle . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets bond boom isn ' t likely to lift economy as corporations swap old debt for new by jathon sapsford staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 19 / 2001 the wall street journal cl ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) when at & t last week completed the second - biggest bond sale in history - - capping one of the busiest bond periods in years - - it came as welcome news amid fears of a credit crunch . here was new money , meaning new spending on plants , equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump . that $ 10 . 9 billion at & t deal , and a slew of similar bond deals from big companies ranging from boeing and anheuser - busch to kraft foods and general motors , may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on . that is because corporations , like homeowners , are in the midst of a refinancing boom . corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap , but because they often can ' t get money in other crucial markets . in particular , they are sidestepping the commercial paper market - - short - term corporate ious used to finance day - to - day operations , where rates traditionally are lowest - - because investors are unwilling to finance many well - known corporations . the result has been a huge jump in bond sales , the majority of which are used to reduce existing debt . since the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , about $ 135 billion in investment - grade bonds have been sold , up from about $ 78 billion in the year - earlier period . overall issuance this year is likely to set a record , clearing $ 600 billion , compared with $ 411 billion in 2000 . " the driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short - term commercial paper to long - term debt , " says john lonski , chief economist at moody ' s investors service , a credit - rating agency . usually , rising bond issuance presages economic growth . in 1991 , corporations sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates . but then , companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operations , a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1990 s . this time around , the surge in bond deals won ' t pump in enough new money to the economy to make a dramatic difference . though , as in the case of the millions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly payments , it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate - balance sheets and help to fund some of the companies ' day - to - day operations . not all of the money being raised is to refinance short - term debt , of course , and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation ' s biggest borrowers have ready access to funding if they need it . but most companies are similar to at & t , which last week provided the biggest refinancing example yet . over the next three months , the telecom company was facing $ 6 . 5 billion in expiring commercial paper . under normal conditions , corporations pay off maturing commercial paper by " rolling over " that debt , or issuing new commercial paper to replace the old . but rolling over commercial paper became much harder for at & t after moody ' s cut the company ' s short - term and long - term credit ratings . through the bond deal , at & t raised money at relatively attractive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial - paper market . other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives to the commercial - paper market through bonds , loans or revolving credit lines . " the ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital markets , " says meredith coffey , senior vice president at loan pricing corp . , a debt - market - analysis company . for the most extreme cases , the bond markets don ' t offer refuge . enron , hammered by a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million that led to a string of downgrades , drew down $ 3 . 3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay investors in its commercial paper . it then turned to its banks for an additional $ 1 billion loan to pay off more commercial - paper investors , thus tiding it over until it could merge with rival dynegy . most investment - grade companies aren ' t nearly so bad off , and thus have ready access to bond investors . general motors , for instance , had little trouble selling $ 6 billion in debt last month , while ford motor easily sold bonds totalling $ 9 . 4 billion . but the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment - grade companies are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their money . take ford . standard & poor ' s and moody ' s downgraded ford ' s debt ratings last month to triple - b - plus and single - a - 3 , respectively . with that rating , ford is far enough down the spectrum of investment - grade debt that many of the ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won ' t touch it , meaning that it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt . ford concedes that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the commercial - paper market . boyce greer , the money - market group leader at fidelity investments , says he often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign of eroding profitability - - even before they get downgraded . " you can ' t wait around for a rating agency [ to downgrade a company ] , " he says . moody ' s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so far this year . thus , the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk to $ 1 . 4 trillion at the end of october , down from $ 1 . 6 trillion at the end of last year . - - - friday ' s credit markets last week was a brutal time to own treasurys . the market sold off so sharply as to push yields , which move inversely to prices , almost back up to where they stood before the terrorist attacks . it was the worst bond selloff since 1987 , according to economists at banc one capital markets . losses were heaviest in issues like the two - year note , the most sensitive to expectations about federal reserve policy . since hitting a record low of 2 . 30 % on nov . 7 , the two - year yield has risen 0 . 80 percentage point to 3 . 05 % . in the same period , the 30 - year bond yield has risen 0 . 50 percentage point to 5 . 27 % . at 4 p . m . friday , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was down 1 3 / 32 points from late thursday , or $ 10 . 94 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 25 / 32 . its yield jumped to 4 . 897 % from 4 . 756 % thursday . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price fell 1 19 / 32 to 100 25 / 32 to yield 5 . 317 , up from 5 . 211 % thursday . why the selloff ? people in the market cite a shift toward the view that the u . s . economy may finally be on the brink of recovery . that means the fed may not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track . - - michael s . derby and steven vames copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk preview / week of nov . 19 - 25 investors looking for answers in enron filing bloomberg news 11 / 19 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 2 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . investors hope the energy trader ' s third - quarter report to the securities and exchange commission will answer some of the questions that sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival dynegy inc . enron , which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it makes money , may disclose in a filing expected today more on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships , as well as any planned job cuts and other cost - saving moves related to dynegy ' s $ 24 - billion buyout . enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 % in three weeks amid an sec investigation into partnerships run by enron executives . investors worry that new disclosures , such as previously unreported debt , might threaten enron ' s credit rating and scuttle the merger , possibly pushing enron into bankruptcy . enron chairman kenneth lay acknowledged last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to dynegy , and he and other executives pledged to be more open with investors . enron shares fell 48 cents friday to close at $ 9 on the new york stock exchange . dynegy fell $ 1 . 53 to $ 42 . 47 . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report , which had been expected last week , was delayed by the dynegy talks and a restatement of earnings , chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said . enron reduced net income for four years by a combined $ 586 million to include losses from affiliated partnerships . today ' s filing , called a 10 - q , will include a balance sheet summarizing assets and debts . enron for years has omitted balance sheets , which the sec requires as part of the 10 - q , from its press releases announcing earnings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . companies & finance international - dynegy bid faces long wait . by nancy dunne and andrew hill . 11 / 19 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved dynegy ' s $ 9 . 8 bn rescue bid for enron , the larger rival energy group , poses complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , which is likely to lead the review of the bid . officials from the two houston - based companies , which announced the deal 10 days ago , estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months to complete . but the ferc review could take longer , according to experts , and approval of the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel securities and exchange commission investigation into enron ' s finances . " it ' s very complicated . it will be very time - consuming , " said one person close to the ferc commissioners . as of friday , the groups had not yet filed for ferc approval . " ( the deal ) raises issues that have never been considered before by ferc , " said edward comer , general counsel to the edison electric institute , the association of us electric utilities . " it has never considered the merger of two huge marketers , and in the past , marketing wasn ' t considered as significant a portion of the energy sector as it has become . " a typical deal now takes about 200 days to win ferc approval . but mr comer said approval of the dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two years . the agency ' s guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the market power to push prices above competitive levels for " a significant period of time " . it analyses market power by identifying the products sold , the customers and suppliers affected and market concentration . " mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets , " said patti harper - slaboszewicz of frost & sullivan , a market research and consulting firm . " the rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated . " now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calculated . it could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market power because information on the trading books of companies such as enron and dynegy is closely guarded , she said . the two companies must also win consent from either the justice department or the federal trade commission , and from states where the companies have pipelines and provide retail services .

" but they are getting more open , " mr . oubadia said , though russia ' s lax financial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign investors . with $ 49 million in assets , the pilgrim russia fund invests between 90 % and 95 % in russian stock , with the balance held in cash . " while the global economy is slowing , russia is still in an expansion mode , " mr . oubadia said . after years of economic reforms , consumer spending is up 10 % and the former soviet union ' s gross domestic product is expected to grow 3 % to 5 % next year , more than twice as much as that of the u . s . and europe . two - thirds of the fund ' s stocks are oil and gas companies , which are still the most liquid stocks in russia . utilities , mining , telecommunications companies and breweries make up the rest . " there ' s no escaping oil and gas if you want to manage a russia fund , " mr . oubadia said . the spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthwhile , propelling earnings growth for russia ' s oil and gas companies . higher oil prices also worked wonders for the russian economy , which is largely dependent on oil and gas . more recently , however , falling oil prices have threatened the companies ' profit growth . but the fund manager , who is based in the hague , said he doesn ' t think people should invest in russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects . " you don ' t invest because of earnings growth - - there will be none for russian oil companies this year . you invest because of the stocks ' low valuation , " mr . oubadia said , adding that most of the russian oil companies still trade well below the world - wide average for the sector . yukos oil is one of the fund ' s largest investments , making up about 12 % of the fund ' s holdings . surgutneftegaz and lukoil holdings also make up more than 5 % each of pilgrim russia ' s assets . while mr . oubadia said the companies should be able to handle falling oil prices , partly by cutting production , he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile russian stock market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks . " can russian markets do well with lower prices for oil ? " he asked . " the short answer is yes . but how low will prices drop ? " mr . oubadia acknowledged that weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and gas into other russian sectors , including telecom stocks and consumer products . the russia fund isn ' t for the timid . in 1998 , when the russian economy collapsed , the fund - - then called lexington troika dialog russia , lost 83 % of its value . a year later , the fund soared 160 % . in 2000 the fund finished down almost 18 % . - - - janus stock shuffle : janus capital corp . bulked up on lower - priced value stocks and shed some shares of its long - held technology companies during the third quarter , a new securities and exchange commission filing showed . the denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter , it lowered its investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of june 30 . the largest reduction was a 43 . 6 million - share sale of nokia corp . stock . after the sale , janus still owned a large 183 . 2 million - share position in the wireless - phone company at the end of the third quarter . during the quarter , janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech companies emc corp . and sun microsystems inc . in addition , the fund company , a unit of stilwell financial inc . , trimmed its exposure to energy company enron corp . , selling 1 . 5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41 . 4 million shares at the end of september . on the buying side , janus , one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990 s thanks to bets on leading technology stocks , about doubled its position in software company microsoft corp . it also boosted its holding in the investment company run by warren buffett , berkshire hathaway inc . , while starting a small position in philip morris cos . , whose dividend - rich stock is usually more popular with price - sensitive " value " managers . janus has introduced new value portfolios recently , but most of its investors ' assets still follow faster - growing companies . - - aaron lucchetti and todd goren copyright ? 2000 dow jones source : world reporter ( tm ) the sunday telegraph the german state - owned bank , westlb , is in talks to buy wessex water from its troubled us parent enron . westlb is thought to be one of a number of financial buyers to have approached enron with a view to acquiring wessex , which is valued at more than agbplbn ( el . 63 bn ) . enron , the energy trading group which bought wessex in 1998 for agbpl . 4 bn , is being bought by its much smaller us rival dynegy after collapsing into financial crisis . the independent on sunday the water and sewage company wessex water is understood to be up for sale following an offer to take over its owner , enron . three years ago , enron spent agbpl . 4 bn on wessex water . but dynegy is understood to want to concentrate on us and european energy assets and is not interested in non - core assets . any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the industry is put off by regulatory problems , and the company ' s results have worsened due to imposed price cuts over the past year . copyright ?

2000 dow jones now a sale has become even more urgent . reportedly , tatas and bses are interested ; so are the lending institutions . clearly , if a settlement is to be reached , this is the optimum time . but one is not very optimistic . for one , delhi and mumbai will be involved , and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs . our byzantine decision - making processes make timely decisions impossible . further , if a deal does take place , there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption . it is much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in mumbai and delhi to allow the drift to continue , to " let the law take its own course " , whatever the costs ! sadly , as jairam ramesh said in this paper , indian politicians respond to developments only out of compulsion , not conviction . copyright ?

2	Subject: steve cooper voicemail - 2 / 14 / 2002 earlier today , steve cooper left the following voicemail for employees . since some employees do not have access to voicemail , we are providing the following transcript of that message . voicemail transcript - steve cooper february 14 , 2002 hi everybody , this is steve cooper . it is february 14 , so happy valentine ' s day to everybody . i just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - i want to make sure that i keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what ' s going on . first of all , i want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails . they ' ve been very supportive and i thank you for that . i do intend to get back to everybody personally - - i ' ve just been busy and jammed up this week , but i do want you to know i really appreciate it . it ' s been a little hectic this week , so i do apologize for the delay in getting back to you . anyway , a couple of things have happened this week and i just want to make sure everybody understands what they are . number one is the result of the special investigative report . we ' re beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result rick buy and rick causey ' s employment with the company has been terminated . to the extent that there are any additional changes , obviously i ' ll keep you up to speed . we ' re also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the board . six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days . we ' re initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors , which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted . at the board meeting this week , i reiterated that it ' s my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor ' s committee by the second quarter , and nothing that i see today leads me conclude that we can ' t make that schedule . i continue to believe that there is a very nice re - organizable platform here , so that the company can move forward . there was some bad news with respect to enron stock . as far as i can tell , the claims base here - that is bank debt , bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward . as a result , it ' s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders . that ' s not good news . it ' s an unfortunate result of this problem , and i wish it was different . but i don ' t want you to be misled and i don ' t want any of you to believe that there is value there , because i don ' t think there will be . in particular i don ' t want you to continue to invest your earnings in enron stock without being aware of , at least in my view , shareholder value at the end of the day . the media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation . i don ' t believe that will be the case here . i think we have a tough road to hoe . i think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team . none the less , i do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here , and i ' m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen . a couple of other things that i want you to be aware of : as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team , we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles , responsibilities are . we are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program , which i know is important to all of you . as that gets cemented , i will provide you with additional updates . and another thing , i ' ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid - march , an employee meeting at one of these local hotels . it will , more likely than not , be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go . what i thought we would do is give everybody , in a plain vanilla way , a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there . then we will have a giant question and answer session , so that if any of you have concerns , issues , problems , or upsets , we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things . that ' s where we stand as of valentine ' s day . once again , i would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support . again , i apologize that i haven ' t been able to get back to you as quickly as i would like , but i promise you i will and i hope everybody has a great day . if you have any questions or issues , send me an email , give me a buzz or drop by my office . i would be more than happy to have a chat with you . happy valentine ' s day . thanks again so much and i ' ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible .

2	Subject: discussions louise : i have attached two " job descriptions " based on my conversations with dave , john , tom m . and you . the first focuses on power / gas origination in texas / mexico as a seperate region , the second focuses on power asset development business in north america . i know john sees a need to focus on re - establishing our position in the texas gas maket . if we combine the ercot / mexico power origination with texas and mexico gas , then this will build on my power skills , knowledge of the texas gas market , and my non - us market experience . dave is on board with me heading up the power development activities and probably would be more on board with me focusing on ercot as this would be less disruptive to his business . i am open to either - we can chat tomorrow . brian

2	Subject: project qin wang lloyds tsb pacific limited hong kong branch fax : + 852 - 301 - 66259 thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you . i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later , information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; he died in testate . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . let ' s share the blessing . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through this email address ( q _ wang @ o 2 . pl ) i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man ; i happily married with two kids . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . sincerely , qin wang * este mensaje fue enviado desde http : / / www . enterate . com . ar / * conectate gratis a internet desde enterate ! usuario : enterate @ enterate . com . ar clave : enterate desde buenos aires : 4004 - 8007 desde otras ciudades , consulta en :

2	Subject: bc election results & analysis below is a brief summary of the bc election results and some analysis into the new political party ' s ' implication . as the new bc energy strategy further develops , we will provide a more detailed follow - up reports . executive summary ? new democratic party sweeps election ? opposition within newly elected party possible ? campbell to consider dividing bc energy and mines portfolio ndp election as expected , the ndp was " wiped out " by the liberal party . at this point , the liberals have secured 74 of 79 " ridings " ( a " riding " is the bc terminology for an open seat ) , while the ndp has won only three . counting has not yet been completed in another riding , though it is expected to go to the liberals , as well . the final riding , in victoria , is disputed due to approximately 700 absentee ballots . the ndp is currently trailing the liberals by 50 votes . this dispute is not expected to be resolved until 29 may , when all absentee ballots will be counted . no other parties secured seats , though sources report that the greens acted as a " spoiler " for the ndp in several cases . opposition party sources speculate that it is possible that , due to the poor showing by the ndp , a new opposition might form within the ranks of the liberals . approximately five former members of the social credit party ( which was disbanded in the early 1990 s ) were elected to liberal seats . sources state that it is possible that these members could re - form the social credit party within the legislature to act as an opposition to the liberal government . sources also state that richard neufeld , as a former reform party member , might choose to join this opposition if it forms , though there is no read at this time as to how likely this is to occur . otherwise , due to the landslide , campbell ' s liberal government is expected to have a " carte blanche " to do whatever it wants . minister of energy & mines campbell is expected to focus on forming his cabinet first . there reportedly is a considerable pay gap between the cabinet and the " backbenchers " ( mlas ) , meaning that there is likely to be " considerable jockeying " for positions . however , there are 6 - 10 obvious contenders , including richard neufeld , who is likely to be named energy minister . sources report that campbell intends to reduce the size of the cabinet somewhat , though the size of the reduction is not known at this time . however , he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development , forming two separate positions . it is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio .

the current procedure is for us to create the product and call dale neuner and let him know its out there . if dale is not in the office , or it is before or after normal work hours , the traders need to call the help desk , who in turn calls amita in the london office who then approves the product . the portland office starts trading at 5 : 00 am ppt . in the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning . this morning the traders had several daily products pending approval . it took 45 minutes to get those products approved . on daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour . as a result , the trader missed most of the trading period . our customers are not happy and neither are the traders . a solution was proposed in december , which i have attached below , to address this issue . however , it only works in the ideal world . it would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time . that is not the reality . by rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade . i would like to propose an alternate solution . we need a direct method for tim belden to have approval rights to approve existing products . these are not new products , we trade them every day . there is no reason tim should not have a level of approval to , at the very least approve existing products . especially where the only change is the term . please call tim belden at 503 - 464 - 3820 or myself at 503 - 464 - 3836 . look forward to hearing from you . regards , mike etringer 503 - 464 - 3836 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by dale neuner / hou / ect on 01 / 26 / 2000 07 : 36 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : donna greif on 12 / 17 / 99 02 : 02 pm to : eol call center cc : product control - houston , enron london - eol product control group / lon / ect @ ect subject : call center - important - please read !

2	Subject: daily california update . . . . . cpuc votes to keep gas flowing a special session yesterday of california ' s regulators gave pg & e ' s utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past feb . 7 when the current federal doe emergency order expires , but it postponed action on another pg & e request that southern california gas co . - - - which has strongly objected - - - be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the pg & e utility ' s residential and small business customers . loretta lynch , president of the california public utilities commission , said pg & e ' s utility is a " victim - - - a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers , " now demanding payment for future supplies up front - - - not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills , but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit - worthiness . the cpuc action allows pg & e ' s utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or , in effect , a lien , in the utility ' s retail customers ' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with pg & e ' s gas utility operations while the credit - worthiness of the company itself is dubious . it won ' t be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts , that it will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation , according to pg & e gas utility spokesperson staci homrig . on the operational side , pg & e on wednesday declared a low - inventory ofo because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system . the action was thought to help cause the pg & e citygate price to jump from $ 11 to $ 17 on wednesday . as for reports of low storage , homrig said that while the utility ' s supplies are very low , they are adequate for the next week . they are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point , homrig said . lynch said that pg & e has not defaulted on any payments , but nevertheless , in what she considers predatory practices , the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided . " these gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh , " lynch said in voting for the securitization measure . " suppliers who have been paid when due , are now saying regardless of existing agreements ' pay us today . ' they are doing this in the coldest time of the year , so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pg & e amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing . " part of the cpuc ' s action places a 90 - day limit on the securitization option , so with the way gas contracts work , in effect , it only provides about another 30 days ' worth of supplies , said homrig , who noted that almost all of pg & e ' s 25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements ( advances , cash - on - delivery or letters of credit ) that the company cannot accommodate because of its cash - flow crisis . ~ out of ongoing negotiations , the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables , thus , assuring them they will get paid . on the gas side , pg & e has had sufficient revenues - - - unlike its electric business - - - but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe credit - rating decline in the past weeks . the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor , state legislature , consumer groups , regulators and utilities . a key piece was missing , however . california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis . reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business . a spokesman for the assembly speaker ' s office said he had no idea when the briefing would be re - scheduled . one piece of legislation that got through the state senate ( sb lx ) yesterday authorizes another $ 500 million in emergency funds to purchase power . it also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities ' wholesale power supplier under long - term contracts at least through 2002 . the measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas , who argued that the state agency be " removed from that role as quickly as possible . " the bill , which was first passed by the state assembly , was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate . it then would have to be ratified again by the assembly . meanwhile , consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bail - out of the private - sector utilities . this prompted at least one of the utilities , southern california edison , to come out swinging , saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any " windfall profits " or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company . a letter surfaced in washington from gov . gray davis to the senate energy and natural resources committee , dated jan . 30 and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand , sign long - term contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state ' s public utilities . the letter , a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here , contained no specifics on any long - term contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem . davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants , saying an additional 2 , 000 mw would be online by the end of the year . responding to questions on another arena , edison international ' s senior vice president tom higgins said " everything is on the table " in the ongoing negotiations between davis ' three - person negotiating team and the two utilities , including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in los angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities ' own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost under - collections . the state remained under a power watch for the 16 th day as the california independent grid operator ( cal - iso ) urged conservation because " reserves remain very low .

" you can consider this situation to be very extraordinary , " garris said . " unless we can get permanent and full - time positions approved , these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [ consultants ] . " garris insisted that it is unfair to compare lee ' s contract with the six - month , $ 120 , 000 deal that freeman - - the former boss at several major utilities - - struck with the governor . " i don ' t want to compare susan lee to david freeman , " garris said . " david comes from the los angeles department of water and power and susan came from a [ private ] power marketer . with susan , we just followed the standard formula . " in her new job , lee will direct an immensely complicated , around - the - clock operation responsible for " procuring energy , scheduling power and associated transmission , and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries , " according to her contract . lee ' s resume , attached to the contract , shows that she had no experience in the energy field until march 2000 , when she joined mieco . there , she was a trader and power scheduler , not a manager . " she was only here for a year or so , " said dina alvarez , an administrative manager for the company . a 1994 graduate of ucla with a degree in economics , she worked as a pension and benefits manager in los angeles and new york before joining mieco . lee ' s contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week , not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field . she is being paid $ 120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $ 480 , 000 , including expenses , by april 2003 . another new consultant , william l . green , has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the bonneville power administration , pacific gas & electric and the california independent system operator . he is being paid $ 85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state ' s accounting of energy purchases . his two - year deal is worth up to $ 340 , 000 . they are not alone in cutting lucrative deals . richard ferreira , the former assistant general manager at the sacramento municipal utilities district , has a $ 500 , 000 contract and is being paid $ 200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts . he worked for the department of water resources for 23 years before joining the sacramento agency in 1987 . hardy energy consulting also has a $ 150 , 000 , six - month contract that calls for randy harvey to be paid $ 300 an hour . harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience , particularly at the bonneville power administration , where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997 . lee ' s recruiter , garris , said her lack of experience is not a concern . " so far she ' s done an excellent job , " he said . " she has the skills , and she has the ability . she was doing a similar job . " dozens of consultants , including lee , have been hired since january , when davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power . the state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to pg & e , southern california edison and san diego gas & electric because they were no longer considered credit - worthy , said oscar hidalgo , spokesman for the department of water resources . hidalgo said that about 60 % of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants . the rest are state employees . as part of the process , lee ' s unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed . hidalgo said lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months . copyright 2001 los angeles times

2	Subject: news article on enron india : enron aftermath business line - 02 / 21 / 2000 abhay mehta copyright ( c ) 2000 kasturi source : world reporter ( tm ) - asia intelligence wire power play a study of the enron project * publishers : orient longman , new delhi * price : rs . 195 the enron power project at dabhol in ratnagiri district of maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in 1992 ; and the sordid tale ends only in 1997 , with the supreme court of india refusing to even admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision , of december 1996 , which while commenting that " this case has highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of independence , political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law " - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the ( purely technical ) ground of res judicata , even though new facts , new arguments , new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners . the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded , despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence , can only be termed as strange , perhaps bizarre . abhay mehta ' s simple , factual documentation - in fact a chronological narration - of all events , including the process of bending all rules , of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra , indeed for the whole of india - is not only masterly , it is devastating . it is a short , pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country . barring the concluding chapter , the epilogue , there are no personal comments , only facts , disseminated from the original papers , mostly ' secret ' documents . all documentation has been carefully , faithfully recorded , including extracts from supposedly ' top secret ' minutes of cabinet committee meetings ; and the specific violations of the law ( which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants , much to their disadvantage ) have been pointed up . apart from an introductory ' primer on electricity ' - introduced for the benefit of the layman , explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation , transmission and distribution - and the background of the events of 1991 , the foreign exchange crisis , and the aftermath of the crisis , the other fifteen chapters , three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book ( of 226 pages ) packs in an enormous volume of factual information . the strange saga of the enron project , and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country , need to be briefly recounted here , for essentially , it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem . the mseb has contracted to buy - and if not used , to pay for - 2000 mw of electricity ( for a period of 20 years ) from the dabhol power company ( the legal entity set up by enron , as an unlimited liability company registered in india , through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more ' front ' companies registered in various tax - free havens . abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over 20 years amount to $ 35 billion ( at 1998 exchange rates , around rs . 1 , 25 , 000 crores ) over the life of the project . one must record that : ( a ) crude oil / oil product prices have as of writing , more than doubled since the above calculations were made . a per the ' doctored ' figures presented by the company ( and its advocate ) , the charge per unit of electricity supplied , at the 1998 level of prices , was to 4 . 39 cent ( per unit ) as ' capacity charge ' and 3 . 43 cents ( per unit ) for ' energy costs ' . the former is indexed to the us inflation rate , and the latter to international fuel prices . the former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally ( rounded to 4 . 4 cents per unit ) ; we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999 . assuming the ' fuel costs ' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even though international prices have more than doubled - we may assume ( for 1999 ) energy costs of 6 . 85 cents per units , making for a total payment of 11 . 25 us cents per unit of electricity supplied by the dabhol power company ( dpc ) to mseb in late 1999 , in phase i of the project . within another two years , at 2000 mw , the annual offtake ( for 365 days x 24 hours / day ) would be 17 . 52 billion kwh ; and at 11 . 25 cents per unit , the total payment amounts to $ 1 . 97 billion annually ; for 20 years , this workout to $ 39 . 4 billion . this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge . at today ' s exchange rate - about rs . 43 . 5 per us dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs . 175 , 000 crores ( as compared to rs . 125 , 000 crores indicated by abhay mehta ) . this is the cost to mseb in rupee ; and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority , for supply of part of the power required in maharashtra . the really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment - and considerably more , depending on ( a ) future increase in ' capacity charges ' depending on us inflation rate , and international prices of lngaphtha ( for ' fuel costs ' ) , and ( b ) depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee vis - a - vis the us dollar - is obligatory ; the assets of the mseb , the maharashtra government indeed , all assets of the government of india ( present and future ) are mortgaged to enron , by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments . the other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by all independent indian experts as well as the world bank - the enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric company ' s and its own much cheaper thermal power already ; in a postscript dated august 1999 , abhay mehta has indicated that already , the mseb had stopped buying between 200 and 250 mw of power from tata electric ( available at rs . 1 . 80 per unit ) and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal power station ( cost of this power being rs . 1 . 20 per unit ) , while forced to buy more expensive enron power at rs . 5 per unit . the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs . 460 crore per year . this had in fact , been predicted earlier even by the world bank . it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived , by a deliberate campaign of ' disinformation ' , of blatant lies , of sidelining of expert opinion , not only of independent experts but also the goi ' s own official advisers in this matter , namely , the central electricity authority as well as that of the world bank , which was resolutely opposed to this project . the detailed facts , the letters exchanged in the above context , the pressure tactics adopted , the flouting of all procedures norms , even statutory provisions of the electricity ( supply ) act , are all carefully documented by abhay mehta . mehta correctly concludes : " we frequently blame external agencies - like the world bank - for all our problems , when , as a matter of fact , we ourselves are our own worst enemies . in the instant case , the world bank not only advised the government of india against the project , it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project . in fact , one must note here that in 1996 , neighbouring pakistan , which had entered into a somewhat similar mou with enron , cancelled the project ( and the power purchase agreement with enron ) , for a $ 670 million , 782 mw residual oil - fuelled power plant , even though that agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6 . 4 us cents per kwh over a 30 year period . ( note the estimated rate of 11 . 25 cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in december 1999 , which works out to around rs . 5 per unit ) . one could go on ; but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehta ' s crisp , factual , matter of fact narration of the enron saga , and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story , about ' the next round of scams ' . for quite some time , the ruling elite in india has been intent on ' privatising ' all public enterprises ; and even ' utilities ' are no exception . the ' unbundling ' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the ' profitable ' segments . all this - as per the current ' disinformation campaign ' - is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply . the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the government - by the torrent group - of the ahmedabad and surat electricity companies at less than one - tenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities . again , much like the enron saga , all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government were overruled . and , abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break - up of power utilities into three segments , generation , transmission and distribution , - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite , for reasons that do not require to be spelt out . though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad and surat electricity companies , and of the break up of the orissa state electricity board before him , yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic ; the upseb is now on the firing line . the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the upseb in protest of the announced up government decision to trifurcate the upseb ; and the union minister of power , mr . rangarajan kumaramangalam ' s statement that the upseb is a loss making , inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation - need to be noted . that 40 per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government ; that tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up government and not by the upseb ; that the upseb does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider . that the remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring , is not even to be debated . the whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments , and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas , including rural energy supply . it is against this background that abhay mehta ' s book needs to be widely disseminated , read , and its implications understood . what is at stake is not a ' utility ' here or a psu there . what is at stake is the future of some 80 per cent of the have - nots in this country . what is at stake is the ' pillory ' of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement . arun ghosh

2	Subject: preface for book vince , ? hope you are well . ? we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are . ? thanks , julie ( we ' re getting close ) ? ? preface ? ? ? one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs . ? in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ? in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout the book . ? in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . ? chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . ? chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors . ? chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback options , and ladder options . ? chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model . ? chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options . ? chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . ? chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ? in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  ) illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed . ? chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var ) applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . ? finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives . ? before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however , the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !

2	Subject: immediate reply needed dear sir , i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account . there were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand united state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned . consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course . modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms . our assurance is that your role is risk free . to accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary . once more i want you to understand that having put in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my country , i am averse to having my image and career dented . this matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves . please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction , if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction . i want to assure you that this business proposal is 100 % risk free as we have done our homework properly . i quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are still in government service , which we intend to retire from in full honor . kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year . thank you and god bless . dr james alabi

2	Subject: ut development meeting tuesday , february 6 , 2001 as many of you know , the university of texas has its most significant fundraising effort underway . as a part of that effort , the red mccombs school of business is trying to raise $ 130 million which will help it to achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world . obviously , the red mccombs gift of $ 50 million ( the largest ever contributed to the university ) is a big part of that effort . however , much more is needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant number of alumni and friends of the university . on tuesday , february 6 th at 2 pm , dean bob may of the mccombs school will be at the enron building to meet with us about the school ' s plans and how we can participate . i am organizing this meeting for bob and inviting all enron officers that are ut alumni . this should be a very informal meeting with relatively few attendees ( hopefully around 25 people ) . it will give you a chance to get to know bob , what is going on at the business school and how you can participate . make no mistake . we hope the result is that you decide to support the effort . there is a unique opportunity to participate at this time because , in addition to matching funds from enron , the mccombs gift provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level . i have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment level gifts . enron and the mccombs school have a great partnership . the company has made a significant commitment to the school ' s programs , we have a very significant presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and faculty , and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years . however , enron has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way which would allow for even greater enron support and presence while optimizing each individual ' s contribution . i am hopeful that as a group of enron officers , we can set the example of coordinated giving . please plan to attend the meeting . it will be held in the board room on 50 , last about an hour and refreshments will be served . please let me or sharron westbrook ( extension 37094 ) know if you can attend . thanks .

" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called " structured finance arrangement . " the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : " in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . " according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : " at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . " the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been " in the money " , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .

2	Subject: thoughts on upcoming visit louise , i thoroughly enjoyed our telephone conversation several weeks ago . as promised , i am following up with some thoughts on how we might best use the time i have on your calendar next week . i am very much looking forward to the visit with you and some of your team members . joining me on the visit will be yoko sugiura selden . she works with me in my consulting business and is also helping me with the course . she is a former investment banker and joined my firm after we were married . i thought i might indicate some of the discussion areas i would like to explore . just to remind you , i have launched a brand new course at columbia university , graduate school of business , titled internet financial management . the theme of the course is how companies can use the internet to create sustained excess shareowner returns . this theme applies equally to pure - play b 2 b and b 2 c companies as well as to the bulk of traditional companies that are trying to figure out how best to leverage the internet in their " normal " course of business . to describe this process i have used the term " e - tizing " . by that i mean the total transformation of a firm ' s business processes such that all relevant operations and communications , whether they are internal ( i . e . , among operating units and functions ) or external ( i . e . , between a firm and its customers , suppliers and alliance partners ) , are performed on the internet . obviously the decision of where to " e - tize " and where not to is ultimately an roi question . ( by the way , ge uses the term " digitizing " for roughly the same notion . ) in order to make the course experience for the students especially valuable and to provide a much broader exposure for columbia in the internet area , i have departed from the typical course format in two key ways . first , since everything is moving too quickly for a textbook to exist , i have assembled a world - class group of lecturers who have kindly agreed to make the time to join us . second , the students are grouped in teams to work on specific action learning projects with corporate sponsors . in addition , geoff colvin of fortune and i are writing up the lecturers and will craft them into a series of fortune articles . so far we have been very fortunate , the speakers have been extremely accommodating and absolutely outstanding in both content and delivery - not to create any pressure ! ! to give you a feel , terry jones , the ceo of travelocity , will be spending a good deal of time on this coming monday discussing the implications of what he has learned , in creating one of the most effective internet sales and marketing machines , for traditional companies that sell to consumers . as further background , the student teams are working with applied materials , travelocity , trilogy and barnes & noble . com . this small set of companies represents a nice cross section of b 2 b , b 2 c and more traditional brick and mortar companies . irrespective of the company setting , each student team will be focusing on projects that deal with using the internet to create sustained excess shareowner returns . the target fortune audience will also cover a broad cross section of companies , but with an emphasis on traditional non - pure play internet enterprises . louise , with respect to your presentation , i would like for you to explore a fairly specific set of issues so that ( a ) the student teams will be able to use the learnings to leverage their projects with their sponsor companies and ( b ) the series of lectures will mesh together very effectively for our writing for fortune . for the non - pure play internet companies , i want to use ge and enron as best practice examples . i have been meeting extensively with the ge folks and am beginning to get a pretty good handle on what they are doing today and what they are likely to be doing over the next few years . in the same vein , i view my visit to enron as having three primary goals : ( i ) getting to know you and some of the enron management team , ( ii ) getting a good understanding of how your business is using the internet to create shareowner value and ( iii ) establishing a working outline for your session in april . clearly ( i ) and especially ( ii ) will form the basis for ( iii ) . i have scheduled the following times with tammie to meet with you and / or your team : february 21 : 12 : 00 - 3 : 30 - - louise ( work on ( ii ) and plan for feb . 22 ) february 22 : 8 : 00 - 2 : 30 - - work with other team members february 22 : 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 - - louise ( review learnings and plan ( iii ) ) a sampling of the kinds of questions i would like to investigate would be the following : - is the essence of what you have accomplished the creation of a totally new business or " e - tizing " a pre - existing business ? - how pervasive is the use of the internet in the day - to - day running of enron ? for example , has enron gone the route of cisco and ge in trying to e - tize sufficiently to close your books globally on a daily basis ? - to what extent is the approach of your business to the internet creating or forcing compatibility of technology / information systems between you and your " customers " ( i . e . , trading partners ? ) and " suppliers " ( participants in the physical value chain ? ) ? - we discussed the critical role of process definition and detailed mapping to your success . could you outline for us the process and what are the 5 - 10 major success factors and 5 - 10 " failure " factors ? - from a technology perspective , i believe you mentioned that you first looked outside for a solution and found that typical erp type approaches would have required such massive modifications , that you felt " starting from scratch " would be more valuable . i would like to discuss that in more detail . also , how did you systematically tackle the task ? what was the timeline ? having been through the experience , what are the key learnings for next time - - - what not to do , what to do more off and how to go faster ? - also , on the technology level i would be very interested in learning about the full set of technology building blocks - - including telecom , hardware ( servers , routers , etc . ) , storage ( software and hardware ) , content software . also along those lines , what are the costs - - capital , set - up and maintenance ? ( should this be 2 % or 10 % of revenue ? ) - how is the overall technology investment managed so as to get optimal synergies and yet not impinge on the distinctive diverse needs of various different businesses in enron ? - how are you measuring " customer , " " supplier , " and operational metrics differently due to your internet efforts ? how has this change the form , content and use of your financials ? after reading this e - mail , if you have any thoughts please don ' t hesitate to give me a call ( 212 - 688 - 2034 ) or send an e - mail message . yoko and i are really looking forward to our visit ! ! thanks in advance . best regards , larry

2	Subject: petrochem desk i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group . from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research . nelson

2	Subject: why i love unverifiable voting machines , by the prez . how i stole your election by george w . bush the first thing i did to steal your election was to make friends with all the manufacturers and code - verifyers of the electronic voting machines . they were really nice , especially diebold who gave me $ 600 , 000 for my campaign . wow , thanks dude ! next , i had my attack dog , karl rove , convince these companies to either alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines ( simple pcs running windows using remote access server - - ras ) , or reprogram ( via a downloadable software patch ) the voting machines themselves so that they would give the advantage to me ! isn ' t america great ? ! ? a little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong , loooong way . oh , the religious zealotry thing ? that ' s just a cover . i ' m not really a christian - - or at least i don ' t act like one . anyway , i digress . did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit polls were in prior elections ? no . that ' s because they basically are accurate . but this election , the exit polls showed kerry way ahead . no problem . my buddies rigged the machines ( and all they needed to do was rig it in one state , ohio , but they took care of at least florida for me too ) not only to make me squeak by in the important battleground states , like florida and ohio , but they also made sure that when i did get a state that i was expected to win , the margin was huge so that my popular vote would make it look like i had a mandate . so let ' s recap how the popular vote thing worked again . let ' s say we didn ' t want it to look suspicious by taking states that kerry really would have won ( except for ohio and florida , gotta take those ! heh heh ) . so we let him win there , but in order once again to boost the popular vote ( i put that in quotes because as you know , i ' m not really popular ) , we bring my vote tallies right up next to kerry ' s , to jack up the popular vote as much as possible , even if i didn ' t win the state . then , with states like north carolina , we know we ' re going to steal the state anyway ( at least according to what the exit polls were telling everyone . . . . and according to the long , long lines of new voters were telling everyone . . . because we all know most of those people were voting for kerry , not the status quo ) , so we just jack the crap out of the vote total to really stuff a crapload of popular votes in my pocket . you see , this way i can get on the tv and declare that i have a mandate and that i ' m going to cash in on my political capital ( which i don ' t really have of course , but we made it look that way ) . here ' s a nice chart to show you what i mean . take special note of how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot totals . and see what i mean about north carolina ? look folks , if you really want me out of office , first you ' re going to have to impeach me . but you know what , if you don ' t have verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( http : / / . org / ) , and if you don ' t take these voting machines out of the hands of private companies that are aligned with one end of the political spectrum , then i ' m gonna just continue to hose you ( and then my brother jeb will be president too cause we ' re into this dynasty thing , kind of like my buddies the saudis . . . ain ' t it cool ? ! ? ) . also , in 2006 , we ' re going to steal about five more senate seats , and then we ' ll have the super - majority . that means the democrats can ' t do that confounded fillerbs . . . fillas . . . . fillbusters . . . . crap , well , they can ' t get in the darn way any more and we can pass any laws we want about anything and put whoever we want on the supreme court . ha ha , then you ' re really screwed . so if you don ' t fix this mess ( i mean great system ) in two years and have a verifiable voting system nationwide , america is mine ! ! ! ! ! ( and jeb ' s and my daddy ' s and cheney ' s and rove ' s . . . hey , we could even pass a law saying i could be president for four more years after 2008 ! that would be sooo cool ! ) anyway , i digress once again . and that pesky bev harris . man i wish she would go away . if too many of you contribute to her cause , i might just get in trouble so knock it off ! ! http : / / www . blackboxvoting . org / i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again , fool me once . . . . . , oh crap , i forgot again . well how about this ? this would be a heck of lot easier if this was [ grammar incorrect ] a dictatorship . . . . just so long as i ' m the dictator . heh , heh . well , sorry to say folks , but i got my way . what are you gonna do about it , huh ? bring it on ! ! ! sincerely yours , president george w . bush p . s . pass it on ! i dare ya .

" the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on " essentially the same terms " as they have in the past . " there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , " he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances . the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said . bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . " confidence in this company was lost , " said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . " but confidence will be restored . " corporations of enron ' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . manager ' s journal : how enron ran out of gas by paul kedrosky 10 / 29 / 2001 the wall street journal a 22 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) is troubled enron corp . the long term capital management of the energy markets , or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases ? or is poor enron just misunderstood ? those are the questions after another week of chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered houston - based energy concern . a year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron ' s shares gained 89 % during 2000 . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up 25 % , and revenues more than doubled . not bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago 80 % of enron ' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by 2000 , around 95 % of its revenues and more than 80 % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers . the stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around 55 times earnings . that ' s more like cisco ' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2 . 5 times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy . but enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a " new economy " web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company ' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ 126 , more than double its price then . then the new economy motor stalled . the company ' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron ' s machinations in california ' s energy markets . investors pored over enron ' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company ' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron ' s troubles were hiding in plain sight . it should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn ' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad . not that enron didn ' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter . enron ' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron ' s march 2000 10 - k , a " senior officer of enron is the managing member " of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron " manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . " it was , in a phrase , enron ' s house hedge fund . there is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done . as stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow ' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm ' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers . to be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003 . we didn ' t do anything wrong is mr . lay ' s refrain in the company ' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency . where has enron ' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron ' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves . - - - mr . kedrosky is a professor of business at the university of british colombia . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a enron seeks additional financing by richard a . oppel jr . 10 / 29 / 2001 the new york times page 9 , column 4 c . 2001 new york times company dallas , oct . 28 - - the enron corporation , still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer , is seeking $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks , an industry official said today . last week , enron , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , used about $ 3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $ 2 billion to pay off commercial paper . now , by obtaining even more financing , enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy - trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it . enron ' s board , which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company ' s financial situation , held another meeting this afternoon . ' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said . two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting . enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating . copyright ? 2000 dow jones oct 29 , 2001 by agencies : agency material and elizabeth wine enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue . more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar . mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders . janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn . the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january . most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are " dated " , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed . morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been " lightening up " their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when . ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been " trimmed substantially " . other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund . copyright : the financial times limited comment & analysis - enron flickers . by simon london and sheila mcnulty . 10 / 29 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty . enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind . its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these " related - party transactions " . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed . with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity . " this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , " observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank . on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle " new economy " magic on to old economy companies . enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading . for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it . the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets . the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : " it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . " the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a " loose - tight " management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets . up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years . balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : " as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . " this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company . it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider . in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing . in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation . a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . " they went after too many things too quickly , " says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency . a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed . david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : " the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . " the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . " the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , " argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . " power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . " enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise . " they over - promised on the new business they created , " says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . " enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . " will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets . and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

" once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up , that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest , " mr palmer said . the company ' s problems have become public since an announcement on october 16 that it would take a $ 1 . 01 bn special charge and write down shareholders ' equity by another $ 1 . 2 bn . the moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , who was forced to take a leave of absence last week . enron ' s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the october 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically " junk " status , though its official ratings are still investment grade . " our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations , " said raymond niles of salomon smith barney . " these activities require at least an investment grade credit rating , or enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements .

" one is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them . and two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth , " patterson said . as earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward , some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment . and plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off . shares of enron slid $ 1 . 05 , or 6 . 4 percent , to $ 15 . 30 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange on friday . the world has changed aes corp . , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in brazil and britain , said thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets . " it ' s a different place , " aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company . " the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , " said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman . return to traditional values bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business . it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise . " calpine does it already , " he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . " what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , " he added . howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies . smaller companies also rethink strategies as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line . " earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . " said patterson . michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america . cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments . allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings . the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time . " the company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders , " allegheny said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones reportedly for 1 - 2 bln usd 10 / 29 / 2001 afx ( ap ) copyright 2001 afx news ; source : world reporter ( tm ) new york ( afx ) - enron corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line , a spokesman told the wall street journal . the company is in talks to raise between 1 - 2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days , it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying . the deal , which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence , would supplement existing lines . these are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears . enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer , andrew fastow . jms for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . markets enron said seeking new credit lines by laura mandaro and alissa schmelkin 10 / 29 / 2001 american banker 31 copyright ( c ) 2001 thomson financial , inc . all rights reserved . the texas energy and telecommunications giant enron corp . was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines friday , a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines . j . p . morgan chase bank one corp . about $ 100 million ; and wachovia corp . , suntrust banks inc . , and fleetboston financial corp . about $ 50 million each , according to goldman sachs estimates . bank of new york has between $ 50 to $ 100 million of exposure , and northern trust , u . s . bancorp and keycorp also have some lending exposure , ms . applebaum said . representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with enron , or did not return phone calls by deadline . http : / / www . americanbanker . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron in talks for $ 1 - 2 bln credit line - wsj . 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - energy trading giant enron corp . is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion and could close a deal within days , the wall street journal reported in its online edition on monday . according to officials close to the situation , the new credit would supplement existing credit lines , largely tapped out after the company drew down about $ 3 billion last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery investors ' fears , the journal reported . the paper said that an enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line , but could not supply any further details . confidence in enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships . its stock has tumbled amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into the company ' s ousted chief financial officer ' s links to some of the partnerships . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . japan : japan ' s teijin , enron study coal - fired power plant . 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . tokyo , oct 29 ( reuters ) - japan ' s major polyester manufacturer , teijin ltd , said on monday it would conduct a feasibility study with u . s . energy giant enron corp on building a coal - fired power plant . teijin said in a statement that it and e power corp , a japanese affiliate of enron corp , would look into building the 70 , 000 kilowatt coal - burning thermal power plant in matsuyama , ehime prefecture , on the southwestern island of shikoku , where teijin has a polyester plant . " we are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants , with eyes on further deregulation in japan ' s power market , " a teijin spokesman said . japan is in the process of deregulating its power market . since march last year , large - lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers . in its polyester business , teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production , a trend which would leave it with surplus power . it is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus . the two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of teijin ' s existing power generator in matsuyama , teijin said . it hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of enron . enron corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in japan . the teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by june 2002 . teijin ' s shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2 . 68 percent at 472 yen . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 once - mighty enron strains under scrutiny by alex berenson and richard a . oppel jr . 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company is time running out for enron ? at the beginning of this year , the enron corporation , the world ' s dominant energy trader , appeared unstoppable . the company ' s decade - long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from california to new york . its ties to the bush administration assured that its views would be heard in washington . its sales , profits and stock were soaring . and under the leadership of jeffrey k . skilling , its chief executive , enron ' s arrogance had grown even more quickly . the company , based in houston , dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - - for electricity , water and everything else . everyone would win under deregulation , enron said - - especially its shareholders , whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets . ' ' we are on the side of angels , ' ' mr . skilling said in march , dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in california ' s energy crisis . ' ' people want to have open , competitive markets . they want fair competition . it ' s the american way . ' ' but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting . some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value . enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day . the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company . the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached . enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas . the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch . the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash . enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide . the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year . philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations . ' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' ' in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company . a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits . enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades . ' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo . for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 . ' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said . still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation . mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business . but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements . now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask . to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances . the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference . deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships . enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report . the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose . in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors . mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company . in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' ' mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year . in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming . david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call . to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume . ' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' ' but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years . now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy . ' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' ' ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said . short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say . ' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' ' james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits . even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy . ' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist . in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission . enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices . large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states . before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power . beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business . the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' ' for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement . enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that . enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not . enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound . but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight . photos : enron , which is building a new headquarters in houston , grew with deregulation . but with deregulation in doubt , enron stock has dropped .

' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings . q . is that legal under the accounting rules ? a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 databank investors seem to ignore discouraging news by michael brick 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 17 , column 3 c . 2001 new york times company investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor . the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 . investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent . all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates . the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 . michael brick charts : ' ' stocks in the news ' ' enron nyse : ene the energy trading company ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron caught the attention of the s . e . c . friday ' s close : $ 15 . 40 week ' s change : - 40 . 88 % est .

" what they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business , " said robin west , chairman of the petroleum finance company , the industry consultants . " in a situation like this , cash is king . " enron ' s biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties , such as duke energy and reliant resources , start asking it for more collateral , increasing the cost of its everyday business . if enron were downgraded to junk , the counterparties could do just that . so far , credit rating analysts say , enron ' s core business is holding up well . but their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal . enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting , but its most recent problems stem from the ljm private equity fund run by andy fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer . enron compensated its partners in this complex off - balance sheet structure by promising to give them enron shares , if the value of private equity investments in the new power company , technology and other things fell below a certain level . those investments fell $ 1 . 2 bn in value from the threshold level , which should have triggered the issue of 62 m shares if the deal had not been reversed . the complex deal was designed to make sure enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that jp morgan chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market .

' s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years friday . shares fell 95 cents on friday to $ 15 . 40 , a level not seen since 1995 , as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company ' s earnings announcement earlier this month . the stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks , and the company lost almost $ 14 billion in market value . late this week the company decided to convert $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash . the company put about $ 1 . 1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $ 2 . 2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short - term corporate iou known as commercial paper . " nothing spells confidence quite like cash , which is what we want investors to understand , " said enron spokesman mark palmer of the $ 1 . 1 billion banked this week . palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as " good management decisions . " on oct . 16 enron ' s third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest . the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron . fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise . the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence . reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan . " it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , " feygin told the houston chronicle for saturday ' s editions . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing . " just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus , but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange , mixed message , " she said . " do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management .

" do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , " said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp .

' s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years friday after it tapped into more than $ 3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re - assure investors and customers . shares fell 95 cents on friday to $ 15 . 40 , a level not seen since 1995 , as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company ' s earnings announcement earlier this month . the stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks , and the company lost almost $ 14 billion in market value . late this week the company decided to convert $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash . the company put about $ 1 . 1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $ 2 . 2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short - term corporate iou known as commercial paper . " nothing spells confidence quite like cash , which is what we want investors to understand , " said enron spokesman mark palmer of the $ 1 . 1 billion banked this week . palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as " good management decisions . " enron ' s most recent woes began oct . 16 when its third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest . the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company ' s newer businesses such as broadband trading . fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise . the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence . now enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper . this is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer , and often with more flexible terms . " to some extent , redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets , which look at it negatively , " said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan . but reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , he said . " it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , " feygin said . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing . " just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus , but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange , mixed message , " she said . " do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . " jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons & co . , said enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned . in a worst - case scenario , investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down , which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of enron . that could lead to lower credit ratings , which would force enron ' s energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it . " thus , we see a big incentive for enron to clarify the issues , " dietert wrote in a report friday . " our gut feel is that enron can pull it off . " feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store . for example , a wall street journal article friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to enron known as chewco . it was formed in 1997 with about $ 400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed enron assets . chewco was run by michael kopper , a managing director of enron ' s global equity markets group . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business enron says microsoft breached contract staff 10 / 27 / 2001 houston chronicle 3 star 2 ( copyright 2001 ) enron corp . filed suit against microsoft corp . in state district court in houston this week , claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high - speed internet service . the companies entered into an agreement last june in which enron would provide internet bandwidth to microsoft as it rolled out its msn broadband service . enron ' s broadband network would link msn customers in over two dozen states , including texas . qwest communications is providing the internet infrastructure in 14 other states for msn . on oct . 23 , microsoft said that enron would have breached the contract if it didn ' t provide an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , according to bloomberg news . in the lawsuit , enron claims microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project ' s first phase . the lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the msn service in all but the 14 states served by qwest . enron officials declined to comment . a microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was " confident that we have upheld our agreement with enron .

' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees . to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge . mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today . the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern . pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist . it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag . as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' ' ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) . if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion . the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment . since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing . ' ' maybe we ' re losing that battle for afghan hearts and minds in part because the bush state department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a c . e . o . ( from madison avenue ) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like head & shoulders shampoo . if we can ' t effectively fight anthrax , i guess it ' s reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff . drawing copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . city - enron directors cash in shares . by simon english . 10 / 27 / 2001 the daily telegraph p 31 ( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001 leading executives at enron , the troubled us energy giant , cashed in shares worth more than $ 100 m ( # 70 m ) this year in the run - up to a financial crunch that has left the company ' s credibility in ruins . research by thomson financial shows that kenneth lay , chief executive , sold about 400 , 000 shares this year , netting him more than $ 25 m . he still held 2 . 8 m shares until july . other executives made similar sales , a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $ 83 at the start of the year to $ 45 by july . they halved again this week and fell to below $ 16 yesterday . enron declined to comment on the share sales . mr lay said in a statement that he is seeking to " dispel uncertainty in the financial community " by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in enron ' s financial strength . enron will pay off debts of $ 2 . 2 billion and keep another $ 800 , 000 in cash . he said : " we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community .

2	Subject: request dear friend , no doubt i know you will be surprised to receive this proposal that i send to you , but not to cause you embarrassment . first i must introduce myself , i am mr . suleman luke from the diamond rich district in koidu town of sierra leone . during the war between our forces led by the ex - head of state , major johnny koroma and the west african allied forces ( ecomog ) , my country relied heavily on the foreign earning generated from diamond trade . this money was personally kept by the then president , major johnny koroma , since our banking system had collapsed during the war . however , as the war progressed , it became apparent that we were going to lose the war to the superior and better armed west african allied forces ( ecomog ) . at this point , the key officers of the administration started making frantic efforts on how to leave sierra leone safely , thereby sharing the proceeds / money from the diamond trade . my father was one of the key officers who succeeded in getting the sum of us $ 20 . 5 million ( twenty million , five hundred thousand united states dollars cash ) . we made arrangements and transferred the money through diplomatic means to south africa where i and my family lives for good three years , unfortunately , my father died of heart attack after two years of exile in south africa and automatically , i came in possession of the said amount as the only surviving son in our family . my wife and my two beautiful daughters god has giving me , are now still in south africa , after i realized i need to invest the fund outside african country , i decided to convey the box to europe with the help of a courier company , on arriving here , i deposited it with the courier company for safe keeping although the courier company were not aware of the content of the suit case since it was declared as personal valuable good . presently i ' m now in the republi of ireland to seek political asylum , just to make sure i can secure my staying here also to monitor my fund , hence , i decided to contact you with this business partnership proposal , i need you as a trustworthy person ( with conscience ) that you will assist me to transfer this money into your account or your company account since i personally can not handle this transaction alone because of my status here in ireland , also as political asylum seekers , certain financial rights to open a foreign account is not allow . i shall be grateful if you assist me to accomplish this transaction and hoping too that you remain trustworthy , that you will not take any advantage of me after the fund is under your care . as i promise you that you will never regret of knowing me for your efforts and assistance , i am prepared to give you 20 % of the total sum while 5 % will be set aside for all the expenses incurred during the course of this transaction . the rest 75 % will be for my family investment in your country . please note that this transaction is 100 % risk free as such the only thing i ask from you is total assistance to transfer this money , complete trust and assurance that my own part of the money will be safe when transferred to your country . i will greatly appreciate your assistance as i look forward to your reply through my private email address ( sulemanluke @ yahoo . co . uk ) , and even as you keep this matter confidential . best regards . mr . suleman luke

2	Subject: fw : two major inconsistencies in ferc ' s most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders you might be interested in this discussion . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : hall , steve c . sent : friday , july 27 , 2001 9 : 16 am to : perrino , dave cc : comnes , alan subject : re : two major inconsistencies in ferc ' s most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders hi dave , of course the decision is politically motivated . but aren ' t they all ? it ' s just that now it ' s our ox being gored . in general , review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential , i . e . , court ' s give agencies a lot of discretion - - - which is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision . but if a court concludes that the agency ' s action was " arbitrary and capricious " it may overturn the decision . our argument would be that ferc is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregarded - - - without explanation - - - its earlier rulings in this case . it ' s no slam dunk , but it ' s the best argument we have . we will never win an argument in any court that ferc " could have " or " should have " crafted its order a certain way ; a court will almost always say , " the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit . " however , courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of constitutional due process . as for the public ' s opinion of enron as a profiteer - - - for better or worse it ' s already established . and no matter what action we take , davis will cast a negative spin on it . so why not fight for our interests ? the stakes in this order are worth it . this recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model ( power marketing ) ; it ' s hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs . the generators get to offset refunds with input costs , we should be able to use our purchased power costs . i don ' t see much downside for us to argue that ferc should keep its word that ( 1 ) refunds can only be ordered within 60 days , and ( 2 ) all sellers are entitled to marginal costs . we are just holding the commission to its promise . at a minimum , the commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings . these are good questions . have a good weekend .

" dec . 15 order at 58 . 2 . in its nov . 1 order , ferc said that it would limit refund liability to seller ' s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs . ferc now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs - - - much less opportunity costs - - - to offset potential refunds . from the nov . 1 order : " however , should we find it necessary to order refunds , we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller ' s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs . " nov . 1 order at 39 . ferc ' s july 25 order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding . arbitrary and capricious , anyone ? steve alan : please forward to dan watkiss and ron carroll .

( otcbb : ipys ) is the latest new pick , set to really move in near future . this company deserves your immediate attention . stock mule team found a new winner yet again ! instapay systems , inc . , ( otcbb : ipys ) current price : $ 0 . 40 short term target : $ 1 . 20 short term gain ; 300 % instapay systems highlights no competition - ipys is the first and only transaction processing production system to enable internet merchants to accept atm card ( " pin " debit ) payments - this is a multibillion market currently , and the fastest growing segment of the transaction processing industry . online credit card and electronic check purchases totaled more than $ 90 billion in the us in 2003 . merchants pay only a fixed fee per transaction for pin debit transactions , as opposed to the way credlt card transactions are currently processed , as a percentage of the dollar amount of the transactions . merchants will save billions in transaction processing fees paid to visa , mc and other credit card companies . ipys developed the encrypted processing system enabling the use of atm cards over the internet and owns the patents to it as well as the gateway service for delivering this service over the internet . the company has already identified several major credit card transaction processing providers that are violating the company ' s patent and ipys is filing several civil law suits to collect the tens of millions due the company by some of the biggest names in the processing business . many large chain store merchants are opting to lower their electronic transaction processing costs by offering pin debit payment solutions to customers . in february 2004 wal - mart ( nyse : wmt ) began refusing mastercard signature debit cards and requires customers to enter their pin number , saving the chain tens of millions annually . ipys owns the patents to this process that walmart ' s processors are using . ebay ( nasdaq : ebay ) acquisition of paypal for 1 . 5 billion tied them into direct debit processing for ebay purchases this year . direct debit processing is expected to account for 45 % of all transactions by 2005 . ipys patents will allow the company to literally own this market . the stock mule team can ' t predict a long term target for ipys because no one knows what will happen when ipys signs its next several large nationally based chain stores to its transactions processing system . this stock could skyrocket to $ 10 . 00 overnight ; and then explode beyond our wildest dreams ! thank you for your trust and keep the faith the stock mule team this profile is not without bias , and is a paid release . writers and mailers have been compensated for the dissemination of company information on behalf of one or more of the companies mentioned in this release . parties involved in the creation and distribution of this profile have been compensated 40 , 000 dollars by a third party ( third party ) , who is nonaffiliated , for services provided including dissemination of company information in this release . pr and other individuals and other creators and mailers of this letter will sell all of its original shares during the distribution of this profile . parties involved may immediately sell some or any shares in a profiled company held by profile creators and may have previously sold shares in a profiled company held by pr individuals involved . our optin mailing services for a company may cause the company stock price to increase , in which event involved parties would make a profit when it sells its stock in the company . in addition , our selling of a company stock may have a negative effect on the market price of the stock . the past profiles are only the winners not all of our recommendations

2	Subject: northern natural gas yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses . the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts . we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services . ken dear ets colleague : on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy . in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved . the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business . beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas . over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work ! stan

2	Subject: letter from : daniel kabila letter from : daniel kabila investment offer . dear , in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory . i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation . when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction ( fax and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining 80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends yielding . whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family . best regards , daniel kabila

" 3 . content window this is the brain of the website . make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand . also , provide your own original content . people do not want to hear what somebody else has to say . they want to hear what you want to say ! while it might be time consuming to write your own content , it sure is worth it . to find content for your website , try searching at ezinearticles ( http : / / www . ezinearticles . com ) . other people may have used the articles , but if you become good friends with the authors , they may send you new content as they write it . be careful though . do not use too much content from other authors , as mentioned above . 4 . font ( s ) several types of fonts exist . the first one i will discuss is fixed width or monospace , similar to courier or courier new . fixed width fonts are good for displaying code ( like html . ) another type of font is called sans serif . it is similar to arial ( windows ) or helvetica ( macintosh ) . this font can be used for long pieces of text . the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs , or curves , in each letter . often , this font is called times ( windows ) or georgia ( macintosh ) . this font , like sans serif , is often used for long blocks of text . it is preferred because its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter , making it easier to read . 5 . advertising ah , everybody ' s favorite . . . advertising ! this is one of thing that almost every website has . the most common type is what is known as " banner " advertising . it is called that because it is long and thin ( like a paper banner . ) how long you ask ? the generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high . new sizes however are being used . take for example the new style called " skyscraper " - - so called for a reason : it looks like a skyscraper . it is tall ( about 425 pixels ) but not too wide ( about 100 - 125 pixels . ) finding a way to place advertising can be tricky . banners used to be placed ( and still are ) only at the top of the page . nevertheless , banners are starting to be placed in the middle of the page , at the bottom , or along the side . conclusion these are only five things to consider when designing a website . there are many others however . let me know what you find that helps you create a unique website . my email address is mailto : corbb @ justforwebmasters . com . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - about the author . . . written by corbb o ' connor . corbb is the webmaster of http : / / www . justforwebmasters . com , a website that focuses on teaching webmasters how to create , gain traffic to , and make money from their own websites . he is also the editor of a free bi - weekly newsletter entitled , " the guided webmaster .

" then , we ' ll start putting together packages i . e . letter , release , benefits information , record of employment , etc . by the sound of it , milly wants to conduct the terminations on monday . we can pull packages together by then but we ' ll have to discuss the process to determine if we can handle that many in a " careful " manner . in a nutshell , my initial recommendation will be to have the supervisors meet with all the affected employees in their groups fairly early monday morning and then have the employees meet with hr individually to discuss their packages ( a schedule will be provided to each ) and to answer any immediate questions . tricia and i should then be able to meet with all the affected employees before lunch . while they wait to receive their packages , they can be cleaning out their personal belongings , saying their good - byes , etc . the supervisors can be close by to monitor the situation to ensure things remain controlled . i would try to pull together " talking points " to assist the supervisors and spend some time with them to discuss what they need to say as well as what they need to be aware of and sensitive to . for the toronto employees , i would have to coordinate with the supervisors and handle the package discussion over the phone . i ' ve thought about other ways to handle this but this was the best solution i could come up with - any suggestions you have would be welcome ? . ( am i nuts to think we can get this done on monday ? ! ) we ' ll also get together first thing tomorrow morning to put some bonus numbers together for the key employees that have not been paid yet . and , i ' ll talk to him about the idea of forward payments for transition employees ( category 2 ) . the category " 1 " employees who have not been paid performance / retention bonuses include : biever , jason lalani , sean savidant , mike burnham , steve drozdiak , dean hrap , gerry oh , grant sangwine , howard tripp , garrett borg , jeff dorland , dan ellis , dave let me know if you have any concerns , david ? .

2	Subject: re : extreme value theory applied to weathet dear vince and grant , i am currently reviewing some of the more erecent references on evt and its application . i get back to you shortly with some points regarding the usefulness of evt and how traders ( electricity and weather ) can benefit from evt . cheers , christian to : christian werner / enron _ development @ enron _ development cc : subject : re : extreme value theory applied to weathet christian : to my knowledge , the research group is examining evt primarily in the context of value at risk calculations . we have not looked at evt for power , because , to date , we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of price excursions : i . e . given tomorrow ' s load forecasts and expected plant dispatch , we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how the system will react to alleviate these constraints . i would be interested in your thoughts on how evt would benefit the traders however . as far as the weather goes , i would expect the weather desk to use evt at some level . clearly you should talk to joe hrgovcic , the researhc chap attached to the weather desk , for a more accurate assessment . cheers , grant .

2	Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . . it was the spring of 1979 . i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . . stealing other kids ' lunch money . no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal . " let me borrow two dollars today , " i said , " and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . " the investment was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course when " next week " rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash , i promised to pay them even more the week after that , if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer . eventually the end of the year came and went , high school started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties , and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money . i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid , and i didn ' t even get beat up . hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn . first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket . second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind . they are looking out for their own money , not yours . the " professionals " , those stuffy investment counselors and money managers , will always tell you that the best time to buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make . ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is " never " . in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem : do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ? hell no ! you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ? the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich . if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the money . what i ' m talking about here is day trading . my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years he makes money . the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours , sometimes within minutes . i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started . society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training . the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money . popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty dollars . they make their money only if you believe two lies : 1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person . 2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade . here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely , positively do not want you to know . . . the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying . after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade , and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons : * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple . * * anyone can do it . * * it only takes a few hours to learn . when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart . buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through hard work , knowledge , and determination . after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk , i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple , secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably year after year . the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes . the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge , and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game . average income of a day trader : 5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year 22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year 35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year . 27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year 11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness . here is just a snippet of what i will teach you : * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down . * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds . * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them . * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make . * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market ! * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success . * * * profit on huge intraday price swings . * * * make money on the biggest news stories . * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns . * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street professionals use . * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind . it ' s time to ask yourself : " am i going to listen to the professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am i going to take control of my own financial future , and start making money right now in the stock market ? " who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ? with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars . the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight - forward book ever written about active trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future . oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market . six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore . in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking for a long - term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t your kind of game . but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then order the master trader e - book right now . i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading . you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move . order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97 by clicking on the link below : http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails . to be removed from this list , please send an email to " bulkexpert @ yahoo . com "

( otcbb : igtt ) has only been trading on the otc bulletin board since late may of 2002 . as indiginet , inc . continues to implement its business plan , we believe this company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the telecom sector . this could be our strongest recommendation of the year . we are giving igtt our highest rating of strong buy / aggressive growth . ground floor opportunity / tremendous growth potential we believe igtt will perform equally to , if not greater than its competition . a similar telecommunications company , talk america holdings ( nasdaq : talk ) , share price began to explode in april of this year moving from just over $ 0 . 40 / share to over $ 4 . 00 / share in late june . talk america holdings previously had a market cap of only $ 24 . 51 million , but today has a market cap of $ 267 million . igtt curently has a market cap of $ 22 . 42 million . using the talk model for potential growth , igtt could very well be trading in the . 60 range in only a few months , with a market cap in excess of $ 250 million . this would be an increase of 1000 % . so you see why igtt has such great potential and the time is right for investors to get in on the ground floor . the indignet strategy indiginet , inc . is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid - sized enterprises ( smes ) with an integrated communication solution . indiginet is a prestigious diamond level partner of avaya , as well as a reseller for cisco and compaq . the company will offer data , local , long distance and wireless services to smes over third party networks enabling the company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building a communication network . the companys strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller , single market communication companies and attractively priced internet service providers ( isps ) . the company recently completed its acquisitions of fox telecommunications and wbconnect . indiginet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability . smes account for $ 120 billion in commercial telephony , data services and technology spending , or 33 % of the countrys total market , and this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years . source : morgan stanley dean witter . the igtt web site : www . indiginet . com the it market based on recent studies , the countrys 7 . 4 million smes currently lag significantly in the utilization of it and data communications , including internet access , web services , business software and e - commerce . worldwide it spending increased to $ 981 billion us for the year , an overall increase of 3 . 7 percent over 2001 , according to a study released 7 / 24 / 2002 by market researcher idc . it spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights , growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $ 1 trillion mark for the first time . in idc ' s revised forecasts for it spending in 2002 and 2003 , it spending in the us is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $ 436 billion , with further growth of 9 percent in 2003 . western europe can expect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003 . though japan will experience flat growth levels this year , by next year growth in the market will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in china , india , korea , russia , the philippines , south africa and poland . source : idc particulars the wall street bulletin is putting igtt on our strong buy / aggressive growth recommendation list for the following reasons : 1 . the company ' s strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller , single - market communication companies and attractively priced internet service providers ( isps ) . the company will sell its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all types of communication services - local , long distance , wireless , and data . 2 . the company is currently serving many customers in the denver / front range communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campus network . the company ' s customers include united states olympic committee ( usoc ) , university of denver , and colorado state university . 3 . the company has identified approximately $ 35 , 000 , 000 in revenues to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases . each of the targeted companies are within the company ' s footprint and will , subject to purchase completion , increase the company ' s embedded customer base . investment consideration indiginet inc recently filed its 10 qsb , for the three months ended march 31 , 2002 . igtt reported revenues of $ 339 , 694 in ql 2002 vs . revenues of $ 0 in ql 2001 . at this current growth rate , revenues should grow above $ 1 . 3 million for their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions . as more and more large corporations come under government scrutiny , investors will turn to small to mid - sized companies with their investment dollars . news - indiginet , inc . completes acquisition of fox telecommunications , inc . - prnewswire - click here news - indiginet , inc . completes acquisition of wbconnect -

2	Subject: re : metals mike , thanks for your message . you are on point as to my intent . from the discussion i had with andy last week , there seems to be several similarities between the metals business and industrial markets . i believe the blueprint that is forthcoming will provide more insight that will be helpful to you all . we would love to share this with you , and also discuss your system direction . there may be some opportunities for us to work together on the development . i would like to have a discussion to talk about next steps , and believe andy is planning to initiate this after he returns from holiday . let me know if you have some other ideas . i ' m sorry that we didn ' t have a chance to get together last week while i was in london . my trip was very short , and i kept missing you when i went to your desk . i ' ll plan some time with you when i ' m there next time . mike jordan 01 / 24 / 2001 07 : 51 am to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : metals brenda it strikes me that the planning documentation could be enormously useful to us in backtesting our existing processes and determining any potential overlaps is there any obstacle to access to this information ? enron capital & trade resources corp . from : brenda f herod 23 / 01 / 2001 23 : 40 to : andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect , john jacobsen / hou / ect @ ect , roy lipsett / hou / ect @ ect , michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , kristen j hanson / hou / ect @ ect , yvette g connevey / corp / enron @ enron , jill lafave / enron @ enronxgate , delmar davis / enron @ enronxgate , daniel hamilton / enron @ enronxgate subject : re : metals andy , thanks so much for your message . i had you on my " to do " list today to follow - up from our conversation last week . i appreciate your responses , and will follow - up as needed . just to recap eim ' s current inititives .  ( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a " blueprint " of eim major processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics , settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the " blueprint " , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and recommended systems . a complete " roadmap " should be laid out with a 0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan addresses tactical also . our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries . the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we ' d be happy to visit with you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let me know how to proceed . thanks again for your time . since i wasn ' t able to attend the controllers ' conference last 10 / 00 , i ' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch . brenda to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect subject : metals brenda as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals . in particular i promised info on a few areas : project q assessment a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals ( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were : q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil & coal . metals process tends towards buy > store > sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge 2 . inventory controls again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general . 3 . funding of inventory we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro to the issues faced . 4 . curve management process the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6 for the far east ) . the maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote . 5 . re recruitment of paper traders i haven ' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced paper . i ' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london . i ' d appreciate same for eim . regards andy

2	Subject: can you be sincere ? hang seng bank ltd . des voeux rd . branch , central hong kong , honk kong . dear sir , let me start by introducing myself . i am mr . wang qin credit officer of the hang seng bank ltd . i have a concealed business suggestion for you . before the u . s and iraqi war our client general . ibrahim moussa who was with the iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months , with a value of twenty millions five hundred thousand united state dollars only in my branch . upon maturity several notice was sent to him , even during the war early this year . again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him . we later find out that the general and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home . after further investigation it was also discovered that gen . ibrahim moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit . and he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank . so , twenty millions five hundred thousand united state dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it . what bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the funds . against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is thati will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to gen . ibrahim moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds . what is to be done : i want you to know that i have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful . i have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to gen . ibrahim moussa , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your full names and address so that the attorney can commence his job . after you have been made the next of kin , the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you . there is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents . please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue . once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70 % for me , 25 % for you and 5 % for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation . should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and i will provide you with more details of this operation . your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated . kind regards , mr . wang qin  ?     - http : / / www . hooraljenan . com

2	Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00 executive summary : sb - 7 x gives dept . of water and resources given legislative authority to undertake short - term power purchases with no price cap through feb . 2 nd new legislation ( ab - 1 x and sb - 6 x ) would seek ( 1 ) long - term contracts with 5 . 5 cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing authority the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of sb - 7 x . the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance new generation capacity and conservation measures negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of utility parents state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state treasury ; socal edison misses more payments bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest . as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a " bailout " of private price - gouging companies with taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial political stance for the governor . but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country ' s economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor ' s political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way . senator burton ' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a " california power and conservation financing authority , " with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain . it would finance new power plants , and " consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . " as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has shifted in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to " maybe we ' ve run this thing out as far as we can . " but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities ' holding company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment . 5 . default update - thursday socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange . after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today , leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources . while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e ' s and socal ' s ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term . the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3 billion from the state general fund in advance of this year ' s expected fiscal surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agencies . 5 . bush policies as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the california crisis . president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments , which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to long - term price caps . however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration , according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is significant concern that pg & e ' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through pg & e ' s pipeline . the risk would be that the pipeline could " go dry " , causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant defaults .

( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in the oil & gas and petrochemical industries . although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they can also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur , such as a well filling with water . as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid can also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level . vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against threat . preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u . s . industry and economy . the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock . information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

2	Subject: never pay ebay listing fees again ! hi , i ' m a college dropout . i work about two hours a day . i ' m ambitious , but extremely lazy , and i make over $ 250 , 000 a year . are you curious yet ? in a minute i ' m going to tell you my secret , it ' s the dirty little secret of the internet . . . you ' ve probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online , but you thought they were the big corporate execs , famous programmers , or boy - geniuses . well , grasshopper , think again . . . it ' s people like you and me that are making the real money . yep , people like you and me ! ever since the " dot com bubble " burst in 1999 , small - time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers . today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with no investment and very little work . how ? by learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it ' s called bulk email . if you ' ve ever recieved an email advertisement , then you know what bulk email is . i bet you can ' t click on delete fast enough for most of those ads , right ? you might not want their product , but remember that thousands of other folks probably do . bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the internet . i guarantee it . now let ' s go back to math 101 and review some numbers . . . if you sell on ebay , you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction . how many people see your ad ? maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days . using bulk email , you can send your ad to more than a million people a day at virtually no cost . whether your send 100 , 000 emails or 100 million emails , the price is the same . zero ! stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad ! imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $ 20 . 00 on each sale . if you send an email ad to 500 , 000 people , and only one person in a thousand actually places an order , then you just generated 500 orders and made $ 10 , 000 in a few hours of work . it ' s that simple . . . all you have to do is convince one person out of a thousand to buy your stuff and you ' re filthy rich . the best thing is that anyone can do it . doesn ' t matter if you ' re a nineteen - year - old college student using a dorm - room computer or a fifty - year - old executive working from an office building in new york city . anyone , and i repeat anyone , can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs . all it takes is a few days of study , plenty of ambition , and some basic familiarity with the internet . i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the " dot com " mania , and i ' ve never looked back . i started with no money , no product to sell , and only the most rudimentary computer skills . i saw an opportunity and i seized it . a few years later , i bought my own home - with cash . you don ' t need any money . you don ' t need a product . you don ' t need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required . if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you ' d jump right on it . it would be a dream come true . so what are you waiting for ? ! i ' m going to ask you four simple questions . if you answer yes to all of them , then i can almost promise that you will make at least $ 100 , 000 using bulk email this year . here goes . . . do you have basic experience with the web ? do you have a computer and an internet connection ? do you have a few hours each day of free time ? do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom ? if you answer yes to these questions , you could be making $ 5 , 000 - $ 20 , 000 per week working from your home . kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9 - 5 daily grind ! all you need is ambition and commitment . this is no " get rich quick scheme " . you have to work to make big bucks , but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do it . you ' re probably wondering if it ' s hard to get started . don ' t worry , it ' s not ! i will show you step - by - step how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business . you ' ll be generating orders - and making money - in less than seven days . okay , so what if you don ' t have anything to sell ? no problem ! ! i ' ll show you where to find hot products that sell like craaaaaazy ! most people delay starting an internet business because they have nothing to sell , but i ' m removing that hurdle right now . after reading the bulkbook , you can build your complete product line in less than two hours ! there is no excuse not to get started ! i will get you up - and - running within seven days . in fact . . . i personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the bulkbook ! i ' ll give you a toll - free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day , seven days a week ; where else will you find that level of service ? ! i will also include a step - by - step guide to starting your very first email campaign called " seven days to bulk email success " . this seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific , exact instructions on how to get started . on day one , for example , i teach you where to find a product to sell . the next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list . on the seventh day , you just click send ! your very first campaign is ready to go . as a special bonus , you ' ll recieve a free copy of our stealth mass mailer , a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $ 49 . 99 ! i ' ll even include 7 million email addresses absolutely free if you order now ! stop wasting your money on auction listing fees , classifieds , and banner ads - they don ' t work , and never will ! if you are serious about making money on the internet , bulk email is your only option . what are you waiting for ? few of us are willing to share this knowledge , but i promise to teach you everything i know about bulk emailing in this extraordinary bulk emailer ' s handbook . . . the bulkbook ! once again , here ' s the deal . you give me $ 29 . 99 . i give you all the tools you need to become a successful , high profit bulk emailer . including : * * the bulkbook teaches you step - by - step how to become a high profit bulk emailer . secret techniques and tips never before revealed . * * seven days to bulk email success provides detailed day - by - day instruction to start sending your first email campaign in seven days . * * 600 email subjects that pull like crazy * * email list manager manage your email lists quickly and easily . very user - friendly , yet powerful , software . * * stealth mass mailer software can send up to 50 , 000 emails an hour automatically . just load them in there and click send ! * * address rover 98 and macrobot search engine robot extracts email addresses from databases and search engines at speeds of over 200 , 000 per hour . * * worldcast email verifier used to verify your email addresses that you extract to make sure they ' re valid . * * ebook publisher easily publish your own e - books and reports for resale using , you guessed it , bulk email ! * * seven million email addresses this huge list will get you started bulking right away . i harvested these addresses myself , the list is filled with impulse buyers ready to respond to your ads ! if you added up all of the full version bulk email software included with the bulkbook package , it would total over $ 499 . i am giving you the whole bundle for only $ 29 . 99 . that means there is no other out - of - pocket startup expense for you . nothing else to buy , no reason to waste money on software that doesn ' t work . with this one package , you get everything you need to start bulk emailing right away . are you willing to invest $ 29 . 99 for the opportunity to make a six figure income on the internet with no startup cash and very little effort ?

steve : i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think it ' ll work . just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) , along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! ) because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and " new entrants " i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs . i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly ) listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets . thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you . regards , brad davids 303 - 410 - 5531 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ] sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com subject : re : possible meeting ?

2	Subject: call for west - wide mitigation plan i have obtained a copy of a letter from representative tauzin and others to ferc chairman hebert which appears below . it could provide some indication of the direction ferc will take with the order it plans to issue next monday . summarizing , the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire wscc , which plan should : prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements ; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms ( rather than imposing rigid price controls ) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response please see details below . june 12 , 2001 the honorable curt h ? bert , jr . chairman federal energy regulatory commission 888 first street , ne washington dc , 20426 dear chairman h ? bert : since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west , including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into california . we recognize the commission ' s efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) . specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law . aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share the commission ' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply . accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution , the commission ' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission . to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity . such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices , " foregone " electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume . specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale " clearinghouse " for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers , whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers . we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant consumers . we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission ' s previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request . sincerely , w . j .
