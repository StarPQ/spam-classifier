2	Subject: enron files chapter 11 reorganization to all employees : this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses : - - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner . - - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing . - - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion . - - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline . these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so . as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer . for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination . i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions . when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities . on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future . ken

" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

2	Subject: re : option pricing challenge zimin , to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds  mu ( s , t ) * s * dt + sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz , the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde . this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm , mean reversion , and others . there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is what you enter if you can hedge , the drift of the " actual " process is irrelevant . i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor , then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of the actual process is then reflected in the pde . vasant zimin lu 10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : option pricing challenge dear all , i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give me a convincing answer . zimin - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm ds  mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s . then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation for the option price , regardless of mu . with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no problem . question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows , say , mean - reverting process ds  beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however , using the delta hedging argument , we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary condition , we get the same bs formula . not fair ! from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the underlying , which is the lognormal distribution . my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde ? the answer should be yes , but got to be from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the delta - hedging argument ? thanks .

2	Subject: organization announcement enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however , with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business e - commerce venture . effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand for products and services with the objective of creating a future business - to - business e - commerce venture . it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director , will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology . george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . ( " tgs " ) from june 1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline company . please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating george in his new role with the company .

( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the " act " ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words " plan , " " confident that , " " believe , " " scheduled , " " expect , " or " intend to , " and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ 0 . 5 o we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . oo we feel this is our best pick since december of 2004 ! ! please watch this one trade monday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

2	Subject: auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal shelley , my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a short summary of arguments against the rofr . we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences : he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ; so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case . vince kaminski - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - clayton vernon @ enron 01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal vince - here is an essay on the issue you are discussing : the adverse economic impact of " rights of first refusal " an option to " first refuse " to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic conclusion is unambiguous . if an " incumbent " has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger . in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the second - highest valuation . now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the top bid from a competitor . simply put , the incumbent with a " right of first refusal " can be safely predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by " rule of thumb . " but the incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted along with the bid . furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the " winner ' s curse , " a bidder realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match it , he almost certainly overbid . given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may just " fire off " a " low - ball " bid . after all , in almost every conceivable " state of the world " arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its most efficient use .

2	Subject: attitudes about foreigners that some japanese hold because of unique aspects of their language and culture , the japanese generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers . in some japanese , this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and behaviors . the japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual ' s public and private faces , so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views of foreigners . nevertheless , every now and then , a politician ' s remarks will land him in trouble . you might find the enclosed article interesting . by the way , ishihara spent two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the past couple of days . regards , eugenio ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate yomiuri shimbun tokyo gov . shintaro ishihara late wednesday acknowledged in a statement that it was " inappropriate " for him to have used the word " sangokujin " and said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and hurting foreigners in general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech . it was the first time that ishihara had clearly admitted to having hurt foreign residents by using the word , which has discriminatory connotations . " sangokujin " literally means " people from third countries . " yet it was used after world war ii as a derisory term for people from former japanese colonies , primarily koreans , living in japan . on april 9 , he told members of the ground self - defense forces in tokyo at a ceremony , " atrocious crimes have been committed repeatedly by sangokujin and ( other ) foreigners who have illegally entered japan . it is to be expected that they will riot in the event of a major disaster . " although he used the word to refer to those who have illegally entered the country , it had a different meaning from what he meant to say , he said . " i did not intend to hurt korean or other foreign residents in japan , and i am extremely regretful , " ishihara said in the statement , promising that he would never again use the " inappropriate word , " which is prone to cause misunderstanding . on april 14 , he expressed regret over his remarks , but stopped short of acknowledging the derogatory import of the word " sangokujin " and failed to apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners . wednesday ' s statement was made in response to demands from metropolitan assembly members of minshuto ( democratic party of japan ) asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology . ishihara handed the statement to senior minshuto members of the assembly after they held a meeting earlier in the day . the statement , to which ishihara will affix the governor ' s official seal , will become an official document . hidejiro kawai , secretary general of the minshuto group within the assembly , said , " an official document carries weight , which will be tantamount to the governor ' s withdrawal of his remarks and apology , " indicating that the group will not take the matter further .

" particularly in light of september 11 , the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes , " said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . " a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year . " rating reviews are significant because , unlike actual rating changes , they are not a " lagging " indicator , and suggest the future direction of corporate credit . moody ' s normally wraps up its reviews within three months . u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening u . s . economy , an inability of marginal companies to raise cash , debt - financed merger activity and fallout from the sept . 11 attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance , and travel . for example , moody ' s in july warned it may cut comcast corp . ' s ratings after the philadelphia - based company bid $ 44 . 5 billion for at & t corp . ' s cable tv operations . then last month , moody ' s warned it may cut chicago - based boeing co . ' s ratings because of the attacks ' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes . in the third quarter , moody ' s warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative - grade , or " junk " - rated , companies , and raise the ratings of just 11 . for investment - grade companies , the gap was even more yawning : 68 - to - 11 . and in the fourth quarter ? through friday , moody ' s warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four . on monday , it downgraded embattled energy trading giant enron corp . , and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade . puchalla , however , said the decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively . " lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , " he said . " that is a positive for credit quality . " the third quarter was the 14 th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades . the record is 19 quarters , set between 1988 and 1993 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 29 12 : 16 ( new york ) enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel ) ( updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which can ' t get low - interest , short - term loans , faces skeptical lenders who will demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader tries to get cash in the bank , credit analysts said . ` ` anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous , ' ' said sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . ` ` it ' s likely that lenders are going to demand collateral .

( csco ) , for example , saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12 - month period . nobody questioned the viability of cisco . the difference is that over the past few years , enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question . if you ' re buying network components , you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier . after all , you ' re buying something you can touch . but if you ' re buying power or gas , what you ' re really buying is a commitment to deliver . if your supplier doesn ' t come through when the market gets tough , you ' re left totally exposed . in enron ' s energy trading business , then , credibility at every level is critical . for now , enron looks to be more than viable . but the company ' s asset - light strategy might not be . gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1 . 65 % in the third quarter from 5 . 26 % in the first quarter of 1998 . meanwhile , asset - heavy energy companies like mirant corp .

" i think enron ' s approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow , " said the head of risk management at one uk utility that halted its trade with enron last week . " they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , " he said . " the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . " a spokesman for enron ' s european headquarters in london headquarters declined to comment . reluctance to trade with enron in europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five - year lows . triggering the slide was news last week the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer . houston - based enron trades a large amount of its volume in the u . s . and europe through its internet enrononline system . last friday the company said trade on enrononline was above average levels with more than 8 , 400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $ 4 billion . traders said enron ' s plight could hit liquidity in european gas and power markets , where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years . one industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the uk electricity market had put on hold their trading enron , which is among the biggest five traders in the market . in mainland europe , where enron has been a major driver of liquidity , potential counterparties are treading with care . " we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , " said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named . french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning .

( ene ) , the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money . but it won ' t be traders who will cash in on this new potential . it will be class - action attorneys . they ' re already lining up to sue enron in at least five shareholder suits . as of oct . 25 , two of lawsuits had been filed against enron in federal court and three more in texas state court . most of them name as defendants ken lay , enron ' s longtime chairman , former chief executive jeff skilling and andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence oct . 25 . still another suit , which isn ' t a class action suit , was filed naming as defendants members of enron ' s board of directors . all the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships enron set up , many of them managed by fastow . most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with enron . the transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband , water and other enron investments . fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions . as enron ' s chief financial officer , he was being paid to manage the corporation ' s finances . as general partner of two ljm partnerships , he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with enron . he shared in profits of those partnerships . when investors began demanding information about the transactions , enron ' s share price began to slide . with the heat on , enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $ 544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals , among other things . that ' s when the class action attorneys went to work . so far , at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs . enron didn ' t respond to calls asking about the lawsuits . among the law firms representing plaintiffs is milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach , which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit . the release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $ 30 billion from class action lawsuits . the lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market . some of the deals with the ljm partnerships run by fastow " purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market , " according to abrams and franks v . enron et al . that could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months . market skeptics have said enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth . enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties , a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year , according to enron . now market watchers will want to know if any of enron ' s trades were done with the ljm partnerships managed by fastow . they will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with chewco investments . that houston company , according to a report in the wall street journal , was managed by michael kopper and was set up in 1997 when kopper was a managing director with enron ' s global equity markets group . he left enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by fastow . do the plaintiffs ' attorneys know whether enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships ?

' s shares have fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest energy trader ' s dealings with partnerships run by its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses . enron ' s stock dropped 10 percent today . enron ' s board cost the company at least $ 35 million by allowing chief financial officer andrew fastow to manage ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , partnerships that bought enron assets , a shareholder alleged wednesday in a lawsuit . the lawsuit came the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . the wall street journal reported $ 35 million of the losses were connected with the two limited partnerships . enron also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the partnerships , the paper reported yesterday . ` ` it looks sleazy , ' ' said roger hamilton , a manager at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . ` ` if you are someone who invests in a company ' s management , it ' s almost time to punt with enron . ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls or written requests seeking comment . fastow didn ' t immediately return a telephone call for comment . fastow and a handful of associates made more than $ 7 million last year in management fees and about $ 4 million in capital increases on an investment of about $ 3 million in one of the partnerships , the journal reported today . buying enron assets fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and partnerships that appear to have ties to houston - based enron , based on filings with the texas secretary of state . the foreign business corporations and limited liability companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron ' s corporate address , according to texas records . fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron assets , including foreign power plants . whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last year . under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other ` ` permitted investments . ' ' whitewing has bought 14 enron plants or companies since 1999 and sold four . enron ' s denne has not responded to written requests about fastow ' s role at whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the value of enron assets to benefit outside investors or company executives at enron ' s expense . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 95 to $ 26 . 05 . they have fallen 69 percent this year . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom , 609 - 750 - 4651 or rhubbard 2 @ bloomberg . net , and jim kennett in houston , ( 713 ) 353 - 4871 or jkennett @ bloomberg . net / pjm / alp / pjm usa : update 1 - enron stock sustains further heavy losses . 10 / 19 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . ( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . " i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , " said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . " i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , " he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . " for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , " said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . " it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , " he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . " what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? " asked one frustrated analyst .

" good people can always be placed . as long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire , " sarah gilley of london - based recruitment group exchange consulting said . " where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets , people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies . " last week , scotiamocatta , a subsidiary of the bank of nova scotia and a key ring dealing member , unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the lme floor , prompting around 25 job losses among traders , phone jockeys and clerks . then blue - blooded banker n . m . rothschild & sons closed its london and new york base metals units . it left its core precious metals business intact , but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process . in the same week , the lme ' s largest floor trader , enron metals , said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the enron group . security with three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time , competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security . " what we ' re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record , which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they ' re keen to stay put , " gilley said . " so whereas someone who might be a big money - spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years , they are now staying for three to five years . " they probably feel that they ' re reasonably safe where they are , they ' re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out , " she said . bonus fears october has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by lme week functions and conferences also , traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance - linked bonuses , which are usually announced at the end of the year . " those who are in work at the moment are sticking . often at this time of year , people are hanging on for their bonuses . but i don ' t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses . they ' re probably just happy to have a job , " sian griffiths of exchange consulting said . lme volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi - tech and telecomms stocks . metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients , and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market . companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal . " a lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re - aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it , " gilley said . " the other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing , " she added . as for morale in the industry , individuals ' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed .

2	Subject: please respond to me asap ! ! ! greetings to you , how are you today and business in your country ? i am mr . xiao wong , bank manager of a bank in china . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . i know you would be wondering why i am writing you with a request such as this but i only urge you to read on . in november 1999 , a british oil consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals corporation , made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at some millions of united states dollars in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in america and britain but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the chinese solid minerals corporation contractor died alongside his wife , from an airplane crash . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name ; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; the british oil consultant / contractor died interstate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . this money has since been sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to the laws of republic of china , at the expiration of 6 ( six ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the chinese government if nobody applies to claim the funds . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is a large sum of money deposited in my bank , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased , which i shall provide you with , is presented . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as my bank is concerned , the bank ' s management has no single idea of what ? s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . consequently , my proposal is thati will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased so that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . acting in this capacity really is simple , all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin . we shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary authentication , approval and a letter of probate / administration in your favour for the transfer to be done . a bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transferof this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin . the money will be paid into your account for us to share 80 / 20 . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . this is my chance and i wont let it pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . there is no risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested in this lucrative role , i urge you to indicate to that effect . upon your response , if favourable , i shall provide you with more details and relevant information that will help you get full understanding of the transaction . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through this email address . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through the email address i have provided . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences may be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting soon . in closing , please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us . upon receiving your reply , i will then furnish you with a more comprehensive detail of this transaction , the amount involved and what is required of you in order for us to achieve the success of this business . awaiting your urgent reply . yours sincerely , xiao wong .

2	Subject: from : mr harrison karnwea attn : ceo kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you . although we never met before , i have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality , considering the fact that i sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country . though , i do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the cnn , bbc news bulletins , my name is harrison karnwea from liberia , a country in west africa . my cousin mr john yormie winpoe , former deputy minister of national security in liberia . my cousin was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then president of liberia ( charles taylor ) from office . without trial , charles taylor killed him . you can verify this from these international newspaper website below : ( i ) http : / / www . usatoday . com / news / world / 2003 - 07 - 15 - liberia _ x . htm before he was killed , my cousin instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in johannesbourg , south africa , and he confided in me that he left some money in a diplomatic trust company in abroad , ( name withheld for security reasons ) . all i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund ( sealed in diplomatic consignment ) from security company and invest in your country . when you claim the fund , i shall come over to your country with my cousins wife and children so that we can start a new life if you may ask why do i need a foreign assistance or why can ' t i take the cash transfer and myself ? the answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my cousin which states unambiguously that ' nobody , not even himself , can have access to the consignment in the company , and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside africa . this was done because he envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund . my decision to contact you is therefore , informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world . i believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust i repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care . permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way . on my part , this is my assurance and guarantee to you . in as much as you follow my instructions carefully , religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch - free success remains unshakable . i have contacted the diplomatic security firm to confirm the deposit , which is worth $ 15 million , ( fifteen million united state dollars only ) . you will be given 30 % of the total sum at the end of the transaction . if you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country . i want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction . kindly include your full names , private telephone and fax numbers where you can always be reach , your residential or company address to enable me send some other important information across to you . this proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and confidentiality . please reply to this email : karnwea @ kaixo . com sincerely , mr harrison karnwea email : karnwea @ kaixo . com denne email var sendt fra http : / / brabrandungdom . 1 go . dk mail service

2	Subject: el paso south mainline shut - in extended el paso south mainline shut - in extended the u . s . transportation department ' s office of pipeline safety ( ops ) has ordered all three of the pipes comprising el paso natural gas ' 1 bcf / d south mainline from texas to california to remain closed until extensive tests can be done to ensure they are safe to operate . the order came in the wake of saturday ' s explosion and fire that ripped through one of those lines , the 30 - inch pipeline 1103 , at a pecos river crossing near carlsbad , nm , killing 11 people . because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline , ops is directing el paso to submit a corrective action plan for ops approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion , " said kelley s . coyner , head of the research and special programs administration ( rspa ) for the ops , in a prepared statement . the dot " is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the vicinity of pecos river remain closed until such time that the department has determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate . " this is necessary to " protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure on this pipeline system . " the plan will require inspection , assessment , and repair or replacement of all damaged areas . " based on the results of these and other tests , el paso must develop a plan to assess the integrity of the remainder of its 10 , 000 mile pipeline system . " the ops " corrective action order " was issued late wednesday , after el paso officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours before at least one of the lines was back in operation . one industry source said testing could easily take three weeks to a month , even if no repairs are necessary . the ops order directs el paso to : 1 ) conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of the lines ; 2 ) perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines by both x - ray and ultrasonic examinations ; and 3 ) because internal corrosion has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline , el paso also must submit a corrective action plan to ops identifying all areas on the approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion . even if el paso passes all these tests and ops allows it to return to service , each of the three lines will be subject to a 20 % pressure restriction , according to coyner . the restriction will be reviewed in 10 working days , and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about the factors that contributed to the aug . 19 explosion . ops has the authority to take other actions if warranted . the ops yesterday issued the seven - page corrective action order , which permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline , after it determined that the el paso lines were hazardous . el paso has been notified of the order , and it has 10 days to request a hearing to be held in either houston or washington dc . if el paso fails to comply with any part of the order , it could face civil penalties of up to $ 25 , 000 a day , and the case could be referred to the u . s . attorney general for " appropriate relief " in the u . s . district court , according to stacey gerard , associate administrator for pipeline safety . preliminary investigations of ruptured line 1103 by the ops and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) indicate that " significant internal corrosion was visible on the failed section . internal corrosion may have been a contributing factor in the line failure . the possibility of internal corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern . " the ops order applies to the 30 - inch line 1103 , which incurred the most damage , and the parallel 26 - inch line 1100 that " sustained an undetermined amount of damage at the pecos river crossing due to the fire . " it also covers the adjacent 30 - inch line 1110 , whose damages are still undetermined . lines 1103 and 1110 were built in 1950 , and line 1100 in 1947 . within 90 days , el paso will be required to submit to the ops southwest region director an " analysis of the continued safe operation " of the three lines " based on the testing and inspection required under this order .

2	Subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . " by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , " the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . " but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . " given the lack of " consensus supporting " gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to " resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , " the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . " . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , " the nopr noted .

2	Subject: transport model andy , the scale effect in the transport model can be explained . i use a european option to do the illustration . i raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount , use the fuel percentage to adjust the strike . the net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up . if the fuel percentage is not very high , the option premium actually increases with the level , although the intrinsic value decreases . if the fuel percentage is very high ( > 8 % ) , then we see a decreasing option price . in the transport deal , fuel change is often below 5 % , so you will not see a decreasing spread option price when nymex moves up . so i think the transport model still does what it should do . zimin in the following exmaple , i used r  6 % , vol  20 % , t  100 days , see spreadsheet for details . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by zimin lu / hou / ect on 10 / 20 / 2000 01 : 24 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - zimin lu 10 / 20 / 2000 10 : 45 am to : andrew h lewis / hou / ect @ ect cc : colleen sullivan / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect subject : level effect in transport andy , the following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport valuation . i add an " nymex add - on " to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel adjustment , keep everything else the same . the transport value ( pv of the spread options ) increases when nymex add - on increases . i can visit you at your desk if you have further question . zimin 
2	Subject: super saturday changes - update i am sure that all of you have seen the notice sent this morning from charlene jackson , managing director of the associate and analyst program . i wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team mds and it team members to clarify any confusion surrounding super saturdays and technologist recruiting for the global technology track . although the global technology track is part of the analyst and associate program - we will not be participating in the super saturday events listed below . technologist candidates will be brought into the office for a friday office visit . super saturdays were first initiated for commercial analyst and associate recruiting because many enron representatives were not able to leave their desks while the market was open during the workday . bringing candidates in during the weekend works well in this situation because enron representatives can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the office . however , many technology vps have suggested that seeing enron " alive and in action " during the week would be a high selling point for technologist candidates . therefore , we have opted to have technology office visits on fridays . the first three office visits are listed below : november 10 th december lst january 19 th we will be sending out more detailed information on how you can become more involved with technology office visits . i apologize for any confusion . please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments . 3 - 3589 . thanks , ashley - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by ashley baxter / corp / enron on 10 / 25 / 2000 08 : 56 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : charlene jackson 10 / 24 / 2000 09 : 20 pm sent by : enron announcements to : all enron employees north america cc : subject : super saturday changes the recruiting season has officially begun . the first super saturday weekend is the weekend of october 27 th and 28 th . we have undergone a rigorous interview process on campus , which will allow us to focus on  however , we are still in need of interviewers for each of the super saturdays . please respond with your willingness to interview at : http : / / axis . enron . com / notice / ssinvite . asp ( when selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who attend the schools for which you are a team member ) . we thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program .

" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

2	Subject: re : rate for tenaska deal daren , thanks - - while i ' m certain i should know , i must confess that i do not know what cpi stands for ? ? ? sandi daren j farmer 10 / 16 / 2000 11 : 39 am to : sandi m braband / hou / ect @ ect , bob m hall / na / enron @ enron cc : subject : re : rate for tenaska deal sandi , sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week . the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will be adjusted yearly based on cpi . bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do you agree with this ? d from : sandi m braband on 10 / 10 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : rate for tenaska deal daren , when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ? based on what index ? thanks , sandi 
2	Subject: read hello hope you are doing great and sound ? i am dr . walker beattie barrister at law and attorney to late sir mark stephanopoulos , a greek merchant otherwise known as my client who was based in the united kingdom and died of complications from injuries sustained after a ghastly motor accident . as the attorney to sir mark stephanopoulos i was his confidant as he shared with me virtually everything about himself , his business and family . i was his attorney for 15 years and during that period i wrote his will and was also named as the executor , which has since been fulfilled . i am also aware due to my closeness to him that the amount ten million pounds he deposited with a bank in europe was not willed out . he told me about this on his sick bed and even instructed that i should prepare a codicil to that effect , however before i could finish my work he had died . after his death , funeral and subsequent execution of his will i went into action to ascertain the information passed unto me by my client . my investigation conformed to the information ; at that point i knew i had to do something to move the funds out of the bank and knowing that i cannot do this alone i have decided to contact you and seek your assistance and acceptance to be the next of kin to the estate . aside my humble self and you , the relationship manager ( account officer ) of my client knows about this , for he was very helpful during my discreet investigation , through him i was able to see the deposit paper work of the money which confirmed that there is no next of kin to the funds . it is necessary for us to move the money out of the bank on time because if we do not do this within the next two years the bank would regard the money as sundry funds , which would give them the right to claim the money . i cannot move the money in my name because he is my client , for it could arose suspicion , his account officer cannot do the same , hence the importance of your assistance . have my assurance that there is nothing to fear about , as we also need your assurance that you would work with me without fear or favour to achieve our desired objective . the legal back up is no problem for i would be responsible . since the codicil was not ready before his death , letter of administration without will would be secured from the probate office , with this letter i would personally apply on your behalf to the bank for the release of the funds to you . what i require from you to enable us achieve the above are your ; names address date of birth telephone and fax numbers upon receipt of a confirmation of acceptance from you a sharing ratio would be worked out between the three of us and communicated to you along with my telephone number . take care and have a nice day . sincerely , walker beattie kentwood associates .

2	Subject: re : peer group mapping steve kean and i believe quite strongly , within a four peer group structure , that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of gov ' t . / public affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical - there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov ' t / public affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities / net income ( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical ) . . . . and others who are performing a less strategic function ( who should remain in the commercial support category ) . with that said , it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid - year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved ( for year - end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt ) . if we stay with the four group stucture , i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov ' t affairs by year - end . on a completely seperate issue , i continue to be very concerned about the impact of the " preferred " distribution relative to the bottom category for " commercial support " groups ( i ' m not implying this is ' nt an issue for commercial groups - i just don ' t have the same ability to assess the impact there ) . . . . the concern , simply stated , is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron , particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non - performers in my group and others were moved out of the company - the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a " preferred " distribution are quite high . . . and that is even before you begin to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour . thanks . enron energy services from : david w delainey @ ees 05 / 10 / 2001 10 : 26 am sent by : kay chapman @ ees to : david w delainey / hou / ees , philippe a bibi / hou / ect , tim belden / hou / ect , raymond bowen / hou / ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , rick buy / enron @ enronxgate , wes colwell / enron @ enronxgate , david cox / enron communications @ enron communications , janet r dietrich / hou / ees @ ees , w david duran / hou / ect @ ect , jim fallon / enron communications @ enron communications , ben glisan / hou / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , mark e haedicke / hou / ect @ ect , james a hughes / enron _ development , louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect , michael kopper / hou / ect @ ect , john j lavorato / corp / enron , dan leff / hou / ees @ ees , jeffrey mcmahon / enron @ enronxgate , rob milnthorp / cal / ect @ ect , matthew scrimshaw / lon / ect @ ect , jeffrey a shankman / hou / ect , richard shapiro / na / enron @ enron , marty sunde / hou / ees @ ees cc : kenneth lay / corp / enron @ enron , cliff baxter / hou / ect , james derrick / corp / enron , ken rice / enron communications @ enron communications , steven j kean / na / enron @ enron , greg whalley / hou / ect @ ect , stanley horton / corp / enron @ enron , jeff skilling / corp / enron @ enron , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , kevin hannon / enron communications @ enron communications , andrew s fastow / hou / ect , mark frevert / na / enron , lou l pai / hou / ees @ ees , david oxley / hou / ect , drew c lynch / lon / ect @ ect , robert w jones / enron @ enronxgate , mary joyce / enron @ enronxgate , marla barnard / enron communications @ enron communications , kalen pieper / hou / ees @ ees , gary p smith / ots / enron @ enron , cindy skinner / hou / ect , andrea yowman / corp / enron @ enron , cindy olson / corp / enron @ enron , gina corteselli / corp / enron , elspeth inglis / corp / enron subject : peer group mapping following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units . this mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at year end 2000 vp prc . we were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3 . it was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups . all functions / activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached . the actions points from this excercise are : 1 to review and agree the attached mapping 2 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous prc meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them as indicated on the attachment . 3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation . please return your comments to david oxley by friday may 25 . to have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final vp / md prc meetings . definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of reference .

2	Subject: sddp model john , attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is : www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls are possible . development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc . while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around 1994 . the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks , so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model . most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine bus nodal prices . a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files . if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

" roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry today . " it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , " stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .

" mr . shebanow concluded , " while there are smaller labels that do provide a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

2	Subject: re : henwood query hi karolina , yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ? my number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i can call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something . the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each plant ' s aggregate values are reported . i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation , so it may be available now . let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out , michael > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > > michael , i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems . i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though , marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows : for each hour , for each generating station : " marginal cost " [ o / mwh ]  ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] - vom _ cost [ o / mwh ] this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results . do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ? it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much . regards karolina

2	Subject: enrononline documents i imagine you may have already taken care of this , but just in case , here is the original email i sent you , with the eta and pa from last night pasted in : louise , as discussed , there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new buyer as soon as possible , in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of enrononline ( netcoonline ) without delay . two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the password application ( pa ) and electronic trading agreement ( eta ) , which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on netcoonline . following is a brief description of the enrononline contractual framework and copies of the proposed eta and pa , which have been revised from the initial enrononline versions to reflect experience of the last two years . contracts structure there are three key documents that create the contractual environment for netcoonline : the ' password application ' ( pa ) , the ' electronic trading agreement ' ( eta ) and the commodity contracts in the form of ' general terms and conditions ' ( gtcs ) ( or , alternatively , a master agreement ) . the pa is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer . the other documents are accepted online . password application ( pa ) the pa is a one - page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty ( as opposed to any of the other documents , which are accepted online by clicking acceptance ) . the pa is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the eta and the gtcs . the pa , signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company , and approved by netco , allows the customer to obtain a master user id . the master user will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his / her company and administer their access to various products in netcoonline . we will send copies of the pa to likely customers of netcoonline before we launch the site . the document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch . customers will specify their initial password in the pa and must change it in the first log - in session . upon receipt of signed pa , netco will under normal circumstances enable the master user passwords within 24 hours for pre - approved customers . for counterparties with whom we are not familiar , more time is needed to run credit , legal , contracts , regulatory and tax check . electronic trading agreement ( eta ) the eta binds counterparties to completed transactions through netcoonline . when the counterparty accesses netcoonline for the first time , he / she will be prompted to read and accept the eta in order to proceed . the eta states that all trades done via netcoonline will be governed by the general terms and conditions ( gtcs ) posted online for a particular product , unless there is a master or any other agreement between netco and the counterparty in place . general terms and conditions ( gtc ) when a customer offers to transact in a product type for the first time , he / she will be presented with the relevant gtc . the gtc ' s are similar to a streamlined master agreement , in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity . gtc ' s identify termination rights , provisions for security ( as appropriate ) , operational conventions ( nominations , etc . ) , payment periods , tax treatments , force majeure , penalties for non - performance , etc . customers must accept the terms of the relevant gtc online in order to proceed with a transaction , unless the company has a master agreement in place with netco . only one acceptance of gtc per product type per company is required . if there is a valid master agreement , then the system will not display the gtc , and the master agreement will apply . password application : electronic trading agreement :

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry . let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues . as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector . dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , " dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . " ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business . the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities . on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio . consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the " great debate " among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . " our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , " lay said . " the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . " moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company " could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital " and that enron " spent too much too soon " in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter . dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business . it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions . at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous . in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies . _ _ _ _ _ correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading : according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

2	Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst " kill clause " for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal " kill clause " adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a " kill clause " that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the " bush price caps plan " collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a " non - bypassable " charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .

2	Subject: take control of your difficulties mortgage consumer information newsletter our new mortgage structure makes your dreams come true . - get the best mortgage rates - choose the right loan program - understand second mortgages please visit our site for more information : http : / / catcall . lending - bloxs . com / index . php ? refid  fngl 2 several factors affect your mortgage rate : the amount of your loan can increase your interest rate if the amount financed exceeds the conforming loan limits established . the conforming loan limit changes at the beginning of each year . shorter loans , such as 20 year or 15 year note , can save you thousand of dollars in interest payments over the life of the loan , but your monthly payments will be higher . an adjustable rate mortgage may get you started with a lower interest rate than a fixed rate mortgage , but your payments could get higher when the interest rate changes . a larger down payment  greater than 20 % - will give you the best possible rate . down payments of 5 % or less should expect to pay a higher rate as you are starting with less equity as collateral . if you ' ve got the cash now and want to lower your payments , you can pay on your loan to lower your mortgage rate . it ' s a simple concept , really : in exchange for more money upfront , lenders are willing to lower the interest rate they charge , cutting the borrower ' s payments . closing costs are fees paid by the lender , if you don  t want to pay all of the closing costs , expect a higher rate which will pay the lender additional interest over the life of the loan . credit quality and debt - to - income - ratio affect the terms of your loan through fico score . if you have good credit and your monthly income far surpasses your monthly debt obligations , you will get approved at a lower interest rate . however , if your monthly income barely covers your minimum debt obligations , even if you have a credit report , you will not receive the lowest available interest rate . our site has more info : http : / / brigantine . lending - bloxs . com / index . php ? refid  fngl 2 get your hands on some cash : another way to make a refinance work for you is to refinance for more than the balance remaining on your old mortgage - - in effect , tapping your home equity , or " cashing out , " in mortgage speak . thanks to favorable rates , you may be able to do so without boosting your monthly outlay . for example , at 8 . 5 % , the payment on a $ 200 , 000 , 30 - year fixed rate mortgage is $ 1 , 538 . but at 7 . 5 % , that same payment lets you borrow nearly $ 20 , 000 more . the best use for the extra cash is to pay off any higher rate loans you may have . let ' s say that you are carrying a $ 15 , 000 car loan at 10 % and making minimum payments on a $ 10 , 000 credit card balance at 17 % . your monthly payments on those debts would total $ 680 . then assume you refinanced your mortgage , taking out an additional $ 25 , 000 to pay off your car and credit card loans . result : at 7 . 5 % , your additional monthly mortgage payment would total only $ 175 , so you would come out $ 505 ahead ( $ 680 - $ 175  $ 505 ) . of course , all the extra cash needn ' t go for paying off debts . when the menards swapped their arm for a fixed rate last december , they also increased their mortgage load by $ 34 , 000 , from $ 106 , 000 to $ 140 , 000 . they used $ 3 , 000 of the proceeds to pay their refinancing costs and another $ 17 , 000 to pay off a 10 % home equity loan , which had been costing them $ 250 a month . then they spent the remaining $ 14 , 000 to build a garage for roger ' s antique car collection - - and they did all this for just another $ 19 a month if you wish to stop future mailings , please mail to http : / / sperry . lending - bloxs . com / r . php thank you

2	Subject: fund transfer dear sir , greetings , i am alhaji muhammad khalil the manager gtb bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development . the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev . you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / www . amarillonet . com / stories / 031500 / usn _ lao 703 . 001 . shtml and http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose . on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my intnatonal passport , to proof who i am . i await your urgent responce . regrads , alhaji muhammad khalil

2	Subject: organizational announcement as things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week , we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently . organizational matters the creditors ' committee was formed last week by the united states trustee . this committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including : banks , bondholders , insurance companies and employees . the creditors ' committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from chapter 11 . initially , they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections . ultimately , they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain . from an enron perspective , the plans for reorganization have already begun . overhead has been reduced dramatically , certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed . we hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future . furthermore , detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week . this will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from chapter 11 as a healthy company . by now , you must have heard of " netco . " this company was formed as a means to maximize the value of enron ' s most valuable business , the wholesale energy business . certain enron north america employees have been assigned to netco to re - build the north american gas and power business under different ownership . we will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for netco . it is our expectation that enron would retain a 49 percent ( or perhaps less ) non - controlling interest in netco . the netco employees would become employees of the winning bidder . we anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in january . as for the remaining businesses of enron , they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention . this review process will take time as it will require approval of the creditors ' committee . we will update you periodically on our process . personnel matters as a result of our current situation , we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization . office of the chairman - enron corp jeff mcmahon , executive vice president and chief financial officer , has been added to the office of the chairman of enron corp along with ken lay and greg whalley . among other things , jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed creditor ' s committee . treasurer - enron corp ray bowen was elected to executive vice president , finance and treasurer of enron corp recently . in this role , ray is responsible for all finance activities of enron corp . ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis . corporate development mark muller has been appointed executive vice president - corporate development . in this role , mark will work with enron ' s various business units on all asset disposals , which will be a key element in enron ' s reorganization plan and value preservation . wholesale services the wholesale services group has been reorganized under the leadership of jim fallon . included in this group are the following businesses , ena , ebs , eim and egm . as part of the chapter 11 reorganization , efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of enron ' s reorganization plan . management committee departures unfortunately , due to the current financial condition of the company , the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of december : michael brown mark frevert steve kean mike mcconnell jeff shankman additionally , john lavorato and louise kitchen have resigned from the management committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of netco . we know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling . unfortunately , that aspect will not change in the near term . we ask for everyone ' s patience and continued support as we move forward through the chapter 11 process . we are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal .

2	Subject: help dear friend , i sincerely apologise for invading your privacy and crave your indulgence to read through my request for assistance in this mutually beneficial and risk free transaction . i am mr . pao , i am moved to write you this letter , this was in confidence considering our present circumstance and situation . i escaped with my wife and children out of sierra - leone to europe where we are now presently residing on temporary political asylum . however due to this situation i decided to change most of my millions of dollars deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of states ahmed tejan kabba made arrangements with the swiss government and other european countries to freeze all my treasures deposited in some european countries , hence i and my wife along with my children , decided laying low in a temporary political asylum to study the situation till when things gets better , since president tejan kabba taking over government again in sierra - leone one of my chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the french government , and as such we had to change our identity so that our investment will not be traced and confiscated . i have deposited the sum of thirty million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 30 , 500 , 000 ) with a security company for safekeeping . the funds are security coded to prevent them from knowing the actual contents . what i want you to do now is to indicate your interest that you will assist me and my immediate family by receiving the money on our behalf . the account required for this project can either be personal , company or an offshore account that you have total control over , your area of specialisation will not be a hinderance to the successful execution of this transaction . ackowledge this message , so that i can introduce you to my family as our foreign trusted partner who shall take charge of our investment abroad where we now plan to settle . i want you to assist us in investing this money , but i will not want our identity revealed . i will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi - national companies and to engage in other safe and non speculative investments . we have been through a lot of health and spiritual turmoil , hence will need your understanding and assistance . may i at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence which we repose in you . i shall put you in the picture of this business , i . e tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss other modalities including remuneration for your services . i shall inform you with the next line of action as soon as i receive your positive response . is this proposition attainable ? if it is , please kindly furnish me immediately by e - mail with your direct telephone and fax numbers to enhance the confidentiality which this business demands . best regards mr . pao 
2	Subject: short term private firm model : static historical snapshot + performance data for model development mike , scott , eric , after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows : we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot . monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period . we will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights . for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance . this means that we will need rolling ( 4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts : input snapshots performance 1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12 month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000 1999 feb end , 1999 may end , 1999 august end , 1999 november end 12 month end performance for dec 1999 through nov 2000 1999 jan end , 1999 apr end , 1999 july end , 1999 october end 12 month end performance for nov 1999 through oct 2000 1998 december end , 1999 mar end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end 12 month end performance for oct 1999 through sep 2000 we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the performance period . our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90 + days delinquency on any trade credit . we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture , it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for analysis . please let me know your thoughts . this will require d & b to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly . regards , amitava

2	Subject: charity sees the need not the cost . . . dear friend , as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is mr . reza abdulla , a merchant in safat , in ( kuwait ) i was married with two children . my wife and two children died in a car accident six years a go . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ten million seven hundred thousand american dollars ( u . s . $ 10 . 700 , 000 ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5 % as miscellaneous expenses . reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address : rezaabdulla @ walla . com god be with you . regards , mr . reza abdulla

2	Subject: california update 3 / 01 / 01 according to a source who attended a private dinner last night with gov . davis in nyc : 1 . davis tried to express confidence on a positive outcome for the california situation , but when repeatedly pressed , continually failed to point to specific reasons for optimism . - most of the long - term contracts the state has signed are strictly " in principle " with no details . - all of the long - term contracts the state has signed have an april 9 th escape clause . - a deal with pg & e on a transmission purchase is at least 30 days away , and thus far pg & e has not agreed to anything in the negotiations . - davis is " terrified " that a third party will bid on the transmission assets . 2 . the state financial picture is worsening . - in davis ' s " quixotic " quest to avoid rate hikes , the state is spending $ 40 - $ 50 million per day to keep the lights on , buying power through the california department of water and resources . - if a deal is not reached by summer , these costs would rise to $ 75 - 80 million per day . - the state has already used $ 3 billion of the $ 10 billion allocated for the power crisis and if this trend continues the state ' s surplus could be in jeopardy . if the state switches to a deficit , its shaky credit rating could result in an expensive nightmare scenario for davis , including state tax increases , cuts to core state services and electricity rate increases . 3 . davis was less emphatic about avoiding bankruptcy - davis told our source that he " could understand " why pg & e would prefer bankruptcy to other options , such as the transmission sale . - the source believed that davis is hoping that bankruptcy court or the la federal court hearing in front of judge lew on march 5 th will again provide davis with political cover for rate hikes . meanwhile , a sacramento based source reports that : 1 . ferc chairman curt hebert is determined to " find " regulatory authority over the transmission line purchase proposal by davis . - ferc involvement could postpone resolution of the current edison and prospective pg & e deals . - hebert would use ferc ' s reciprocal agreements with other publicly owned utilities as a basis for exerting jurisdiction over the proposed california power authority . 2 . the legislature continues to lose faith in davis . - the democrat caucus is concerned about state finances and the likelihood of rate increases . - the republican caucus sees a political opportunity in portraying davis as wasting time on the transmission asset purchase proposal , rather than dealing with more direct solutions to the crisis . - both the democrats and republicans are concerned that davis ' s plan will not work and all agree that there is no way around increased rates . even if a transmission asset deal goes through , the state will still be on the hook for $ 40 - $ 50 million per day for power purchases . - ab ix requires that the money spent by dwr be repaid to the general fund . however , because it may be a while before the revenue bonds are issued , the legislative analyst office ( lao ) noted cash flow concerns . the department of finance expects to have revenue bonds issued by mid to late may .

2	Subject: alliance update note : alliance announced an october 30 official in - service date for tariff services ; however , they will be selling test gas in ramp up period . right now , these first deliveries are going into the anr system because it is the only interconnect that is ready . alliance delayed , but deliveries begin ramping up after months of speculation in the industry , alliance pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until oct . 30 . when construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago , oct . 2 was the target date for commercial service . however , the delay doesn ' t mean the market won ' t be getting any canadian gas out of alliance until the end of october . the pipeline opened one of its chicago delivery valves last thursday and started selling 50 - 100 mmcf / d of gas into the market . it intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full 1 . 325 bcf / d load prior to switching to commercial service on oct . 30 , said spokesman jack crawford . " we got commission approval to actually sell our test gas . right now i think we are dealing with three or four different marketers . our initial deliveries right now are into the anr system . that ' s because its basically the only connection that is ready , but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all . " i ' d be surprised if it ends up being regular [ volume increases of 100 mmcf / d each week ] but that ' s kind of the game plan , " said crawford . " on oct . 29 it will be alliance selling [ 1 . 325 bcf / d of ] test gas , and on oct . 30 it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other . the market may not see much of a difference . we obviously don ' t want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out . " the pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern british columbia and northwestern alberta to the chicago area where the line interconnects with the north american pipeline grid . currently , more than 99 % of the total pipeline system has been installed , including 14 mainline compressor stations , 37 receipt points in british columbia and alberta , and 7 delivery points in illinois . commissioning activities commenced in march , including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe . at present , approximately 95 % of alliance has been purged of air . this includes all the mainline portion of the system ( 1 , 857 miles ) from near gordondale , alberta to the delivery section near joliet , illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals receipt portion of the system . additionally , 25 receipt point meter stations have been commissioned . final commissioning activities are also being completed at 14 mainline compressor stations . to date , 6 bcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system , with the ultimate line pack targeted at 8 bcf . crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed start - up . " the rain in saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in july , but we managed to catch up on the construction there in august . but it then meant that some of our commissioning didn ' t get going until a little bit later . farther west in alberta and bc in fact we ' ve had a couple of rain problems . in particular , we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we haven ' t even been able to get on the right of way yet and that ' s because of rain . " up in bc we ' ve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there , " he said . " we ' re likely to get approval to open - cut that creek , but that will take us probably the better part of a month . " on the downstream end , we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now . we are testing one , but some of the others aren ' t quite ready yet . we ' re ready , but they are not . then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [ aux sable liquids ] plant . we haven ' t had a chance to work on that yet . so when you look at all of those things , the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational . we spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction . we agreed we would pick one of three dates , all mondays : oct . 2 , oct . 16 or oct . 30 , and we just had to pick one that we felt confident in . " besides the timing of service , there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers . will the gas alliance ships come oct . 30 be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through transcanada . " i don ' t think it ' s going to be purely either way , " said crawford . " lots of guys are targeting for nov . 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up . it ' s not a big secret that we ' ve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn ' t gotten done . that ' s likely to have some affect on it as well . that ' s a delay though . how long are people going to pay $ 6 for gas ? boy , people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects .

2	Subject: california energy crisis california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron ' s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts : ? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates . ? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices . ? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times . enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities . increasing supply california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .

2	Subject: full circle : asps the new big blue ? network world fusion focus : mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? 03 / 15 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three - letter acronyms . remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure , especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to maintain . of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity . and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell , so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion . looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off . thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application management . the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the principle remains the same : central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ? to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow . nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop . however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing ! so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers . to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these days . to contact mike jude and nancy meachim : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a manager of public policy . mike can be reached at mailto : jude @ . com . meachim focuses on e - business management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp management that is due to be released in april . nancy ' s email address is mailto : meachim @ . com . for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com buzz : application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 / 27 / 99 asp research page , network world all about asps information center for application service providers , their customers and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp industry consortium . http : / / www . aspindustry . org / subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

" vincejkaminski " cc : subject : ? preface for book vince , hope you are well . we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and ? you kindly offered that you would provide this . is this still ? possible ? we realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ? ahead and wrote something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or ? re - write the preface , that would be very appreciated . let me know ? what your thoughts are . thanks , julie ( we ' re getting close ) preface one of our main objectives in ? writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk management has been to bring ? together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management ? energy derivatives as possible , to discuss in - depth the models , and to show how ? they relate to each other . in this ? way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide ? range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a ? consistent modelling framework . we ? believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue ? to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk ? management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ? ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent ? models ? ) . however , it is not ? our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models , at the exclusion of ? the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user ? ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs . in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ? model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the book . in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ? merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined curves . in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors . chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback options , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model . chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of path dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic as well as standard european and american style options . chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ? in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ? of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ? illustrating the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ? portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed . chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var ) applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ? discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio of energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market ? variables . finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan ( 1997 ) ) and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which detailed information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ? of tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives . before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly not ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics technical document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot ? easier !

2	Subject: re : stealth louise , the earnings strategy of all " stealth " projects is to sell of the majority of the equity in the project to a third party . i don ' t think we know yet whether someone like transalta would be interested in a project of this size and at this location but we would certainly welcome any and all interested buyers of the project to a selldown process . we do think that most buyers would place a premium on their offer for the equity in these projects if financing has already occurred or is assurred , but we are not married to the idea . as to the financing fees , we have assumed us $ 750 , 000 as a minimum up front fee a bank would charge for the project to be worth their time . brian kerrigan provided me with that cost assumption for a one - off financing for a project of this size , prior to his leaving . thanks , steve

2	Subject: portland lease i had a brief discussion with marcus buergler on tuesday regarding the portland space . i indicated to him that our desire would be to move , but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made . in the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money . on top of that , there are roughly $ 600 k worth of improvements ( separating from pge ) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce . based on my very brief discussion with marcus on tuesday , i was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building . i learned today that the estate has accepted the pge lease for this space and that we have to stay here . this is very depressing if it is true . from a money point of view i don ' t think that it is the best decsion . more importantly , from a morale point of view this place is horrible . we have 15 , 000 square feet when we need between 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 . it is absolutely depressing here . people are very much in favor of moving . please advise .

( gives us choices ) please after today , once we get together regarding this matter , i will let ina continue with the process , whereby , i can continue focusing on what is best for my group as well as the floor . thanks kevin moore

2	Subject: california update 3 / 16 / 01 ? a source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coram energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week . through an intermediary , we were able to corroborate this information with a senior member of the ca iso board . coram energy is a relatively small wind generator qf based in west vancouver , british columbia , though it also owns wind stations in california . coram has 238 40 kw units . ? the source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis to be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature . it is unlikely that blackouts would happen in april or may , meaning a long wait for the cash strapped qfs to wait to get paid . ? the filing will be against socal . ? in order to file an involuntary bankruptcy , coram would have to file along with at least two other creditors owed $ 10 , 000 or more . sources report coram has two other creditors who will file with them ( working on finding out who they are ) . ? sources also report that other qfs are " taking legal advice " on how to proceed in light of these developments .

2	Subject: help dear friend , i am mrs iyesa ismiana , named person from kuwait . i am married to late malam usman ismiana of blessed memory who worked with kuwait embassy in sudan for nine years before he died in the year 2000 . we were married for eleven years without a child . he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days . before his death we were both very devoted muslims . since his death i too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems . when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $ 10 . 5 million ( ten million five hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) with an oversea security company . presently , this money is still with the security company . recently , my doctor told me that i would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness . having known my condition i decided todonate this fund to either a moslem organisation or devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct here - in . i want this muslim organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to fund mosques , orphanages , widows and also propagating the word of allah and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy quran . the holy quran emphasized so much on allah ' s benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step . i took this decision because i don? ? ? t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new christians converts and i don? ? ? t want my husband? ? ? s hard earned money to be misused by people i call unbelievers . i don? ? ? t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner . hence the reason for taking this bold decision . i know that after death i will be with allah the most beneficient and the most merciful . i don? ? ? t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also the presence of my husband? ? ? s relatives around me always . i don? ? ? t want them to know about this development . with allah all things are possible . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you thecontact of the security company . i will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original - beneficiary of this fund . i want you and the muslim community where you reside to always pray for me . my happiness is that i lived a life of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation . whoever that wants to serve the allah must serve him in truth and in fairness . please always be prayerful all through your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a muslim organisation or a devoted muslim for this same purpose . until i hear from you , my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders . may the almighty allah continue to guide and protect you . if its ok reply to this e - maill address ye _ smao 02 @ yahoo . ca regards , iyesa ismiana
