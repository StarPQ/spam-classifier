2	Subject: plane crash of 31 st of october 1999 from : mr frank fido director , delivery / operations re : plane crash of 31 st of october 1999 i am mr frank fido , the director of delivery / operations in a security company here in south africa . our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of africa especially top government officials and military leaders here in africa . i have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us . i have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top ecret . to be explicit and straight to the point , some time early 1997 , a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company ' s vault for safe keeping . and since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment , which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage . consequently , in our bid to contact this client to redeem his consignment to prevent more accumulation of demurrage , we discovered that our client was engineer robert fitzpatrick who worked for a multinational company in europe and on the 31 st of october 1999 , he and his wife were involved in a plane crash on board egyptian boeing 767 from america that crashed into the atlantic ocean off the massachusetts coast early sunday morning , about half an hour after leaving new york ' s jf kennedy international airport ( see website for details ) since the death of our client engineer robert fitzpatrick , none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us , which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment . hence out of curiosity i decided to secretly scan the box that our client deposited in our vault . and to my surprise i discovered that the two boxes that were registered as treasures by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in united states dollars estimated to be over us $ 15 million us dollar . since this development i have been nursing plans secretly . my investigation revealed that late mr fitzpatrick had the intention of establishing an oil drilling / engineering firm in africa and was moving saving the money for that purpose . . it is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client intended for use for realize his ambitions . now that he is dead there is no trace to this money in our care . i am now soliciting your noble assistance to in transferring this money out of south africa to your country for immediate investment with your assistance . i have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 40 % of the total amount . upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me in this transaction , i will immediately arrange and ransfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment . this transaction is 100 % risk free . please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter . i await your most prompt response . yours faithfully . mr frank fido

2	Subject: strange bedfellows senators dianne feinstein and gordon smith announce partnership in response to the western energy crisis march 15 , 2001 washington , dc - senators dianne feinstein ( d - ca ) and gordon smith ( r - or ) today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the western energy market by directing the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) to impose a temporary " just and reasonable " wholesale rate cap or cost - of - service based rates . the legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pass on the cost of the electricity to retail customers . however , the states would be able to determine how and when this would be done . in other words , california could choose to use tiered - pricing , real - time pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through . " we now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energy costs , " senator feinstein said . " ferc has found the wholesale prices being charged in california to be unjust and unreasonable . this legislation essentially will mandate that once ferc makes such a finding , the agency will carry out its regulatory role . this is a $ 175 million a year agency . it is there to regulate the energy marketplace , and it should . what the federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis . unfortunately ferc has refused to do so . " " california ' s broken electricity market is a result of a flawed 1996 california law that deregulated wholesale costs , but left in place caps on retail prices . this was coupled with a requirement that the utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market , where prices have escalated dramatically . in hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario , so that today , california buys electricity at astronomical prices . we believe that ferc needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace .

2	Subject: [ ilug ] assistance from : col . michael bundu . democratic republic of congo . tel no : your country intl . access code + 8821652098236 email : mikebundu @ rediffmail . com dear sir / madam seeking your immediate assistance . please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner . this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner . this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously . my name is col . michael bundu of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory , may his soul rest in peace . due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country , i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ( us $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ) to fight the rebel group . we were then given this money privately by the then president , laurent kabila , without the knowledge of other cabinet members . but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot - out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo , we immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping . the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col . rasheidi karesava ( one of the aides to laurent kabila ) a tribesman , and some other military personnel from our same tribe , by the new president of the democratic republic of congo , the son of late president laurent kabila , joseph kabila . in view of this , we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary . we have sufficient ' ' contacts ' ' here to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in europe in your name . this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ' ' confidential ' ' and it will not pass through normal custom / airport screening and clearance . our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends ( western countries ) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila , immediately after his son took office . though we have neither seen nor met each other , the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance , this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks . the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality . we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in europe . this is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for . thus , if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of congo , you can contact me through my email addresses , tel / fax nos . above with your telephone , fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share ( percentage ) for assisting us . please note that there are no risks involved in this deal as everyone ' s security is guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines . i will hence furnish you with further details of this deal as soon as i am assured of your sincere interest to assist us . i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential , whatever your decision , while i await your prompt response . thank you and god bless . best regards col . michael bundu ( rtd ) . m _ bundu @ rediffmail . com n \ b . when you are calling my line , you dial your country intl . access code , then you dial directly , do not include my country code i . e .

2	Subject: kern river problems as was foretold by some of the kern expansion shippers , these shippers are justifiably angry about the way kern has sold capacity in their open season , particularly as concerns shippers ' access to markets on socal gas through wheeler ridge . however , what ' s even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message tw embodied in its gir proposal - - new market entrants should only have secondary rights to socal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage . shippers dispute kern ' s wheeler ridge sales chevron , amoco production , canwest gas supply , aera energy and rme petroleum have called on ferc to stop kern river gas transmission from overselling delivery point rights at wheeler ridge into the southern california gas co . distribution system . the firm shippers said in comments filed this week that , in a situation strangely similar to the recent el paso capacity reallocation case , kern river has oversold capacity at wheeler ridge , and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation ( docket cpol - 31 ) . on nov . 15 , 2000 , kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74 , 500 dth / d of additional delivery point capacity at wheeler ridge into socal gas . but firm shippers claim recent data provided by kern and socal gas indicates kern river already has sold more than the 450 mmcf / d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into wheeler ridge . firm shippers told ferc . kern river has sold 468 . 4 mmcf / d of capacity at wheeler ridge . not true , says lynn dahlberg , kern ' s manager of marketing . " we have to date subscribed at 450 , 000 dth / d . and unless we subscribe at more than 830 , 000 dth / d , we have not sold more capacity than socal has takeaway . " the combined kern - mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600 , 000 dth / d , with kern having 450 , 00 and mojave 150 , 000 . " we can move more than that capacity , and we have , " she added . socal gas has noted that it curtails nominations from kern on a regular basis , shippers said . with the proposed expansion project , kern will be " creating the same type of firm delivery point over - sale situation that the commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on el paso natural gas at el paso ' s socal gas / topock delivery point , " they added . while they support the expansion , they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in southern california degraded . they also complained that kern ' s marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to wheeler ridge . dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the wheeler ridge point , but " adding more players to wheeler gives markets on socal more supply options . shippers have to compete . " the shippers are concerned , however that " substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to kern river and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers . . . . " the commission should prohibit kern from selling additional firm rights at wheeler ridge , or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [ emphasis added ] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers , they said .

2	Subject: new cash conrol process - 2 : 00 pm meeting , december 5 , 2001 in the 50 th floor board room overview our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management procedures of enron . because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors , we now must move to centralized cash management . these new procedures will amend our prior policy . as management of the " debtor " , we should approach each decision about our business , including cash receipts and disbursements , from the perspective of , " does this enhance the value of the debtor ' s estate ? " this memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately implemented both for entities in the chapter 11 reorganization and entities that have not filed . there will be a meeting wednesday , december 5 , 2001 at 2 : 00 pm in the board room on the 50 th floor to discuss the new policies . as a debtor - in - possession ( " dip " ) , we have new cash flow reporting obligations and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget . failure to adhere could have serious consequences to our dip financing availability as well as diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiate our ultimate exit from chapter 11 as a reorganized entity . all enron business units ( not just the ones in bankruptcy ) will need to conform to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing , and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the company . there are special procedures outlined at the end of the memo specifically relating to the business units in bankruptcy ( the debtor business units ) . new processes and procedures until further notice , a newly formed committee , the cash flow management committee ( the " committee " ) , will meet daily to review and approve daily payments and 5 - day projections for each business unit . the committee will be headed by george wasaff and will also consist of ray bowen , dave gorte , tim despain , bob butts , julia murray and lisa mellencamp . the committee will be assisted by our financial advisor , batchelder & partners and our outside counsel , weil , gotshal ( 2 ) be mission critical ; and ( 3 ) there must not be a substitute vendor . the business unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to the committee for any disbursements to critical pre - petition vendors meet this test . the committee ' s presumption will be that a vendor is not critical . if you believe that a pre - petition claim clearly meets the " critical " test , you may submit it as a clearly flagged item , stating your reasons for requested payment . the committee and corporate management will consider these recommendations by the business unit . internal controls we need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are required , especially in light of recent personnel changes . all internal controls , new and existing , will be subject to review by andrew parsons . he will be communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any changes to be made . i look forward to seeing you this afternoon at the meeting . exhibit a - enron entities that have filed filed december 2 , 2001 1 . enron metals and commodity 2 . enron corp .

2	Subject: update : ffvols ted , an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen

2	Subject: enron europe organisational changes once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing arcos . we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman . the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and the continental gas team . ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent , and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission responsibilities . finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis . we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help make these changes as smooth as possible . john sherriff michael brown

2	Subject: schedule c reserves we have had trouble valueing transmission , literally forever . we finally released a spread option model last night to value transmission . it spit out some huge values for out of the money transmission because it is valued as a daily option . for example , transmission from big eddy ( in the northwest ) to nob spit out a value of $ 28 million - - all extrinsic . given the state of affairs in california right now , i find it highly unlikely that we will take power from the northwest to deliver into the capped market . last night we recognized $ 16 million of transmission value , almost all intrinsic value associated with closing open positions . we reserved $ 36 million associated with extrinsic value . we will revalue the options once a week and make appropriate adjustments to the reserves . let me know if you have any questions or concerns .

2	Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting , followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings . in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203 merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be determined to be " workably competitive . " at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are provided below . ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products . according to ferc , the draft order : - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ; - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses . - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns ; and - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements . the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register . commissioner reaction : comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before , and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative market analysis . comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be " efficient yet sufficient " . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality . comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt , massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry . chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be viewed favorably . nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably competitive in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be " workably competitive . " at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000 compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve market by april 2001 , as the iso requested . commissioner reaction : comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an " imperfect solution , " yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls . hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted . in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ; stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .   recent ferc filings   ( 1 ) rto developments * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring , reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 . * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 . * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 . * el segundo power filed a motion " requesting order on request for rehearing by date certain " in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 . * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november 22 , 2000 . * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

2	Subject: california update 7 / 13 / 01 executive summary ferc settlement developments socal ed . mou / plan b the cpuc ' s new rate proposal ferc developments ferc ' s publicly recognized autonomy regarding california power talks likely has a less public , less autonomous , role in determining the outcome of debated refunds . the following analysis emphasizes the multiple dimensions and variables now at play in the california settlement negotiations : the bush administration does have influence over what ferc decides - - especially now that pat wood and other republicans are there . the influence is certainly not formal ( as ferc is supposed to be an independent agency ) , but the commissioners generally do not issue decisions without taking the " political lay of the land " - - particularly regarding the positions of the white house . bush and davis do not like each other ( no surprise there ) . communication between the davis administration , the white house and ferc is not free flowing . interaction between ferc and white house is frequent - - but with davis only on an as - needed basis . ( staff level contacts are more regular - - especially staff of the democrat commissioners ) . administrative law judge c . wagner will probably recommend a refund at under or close to $ 1 b - - and the commission will not go higher than what the judge recommends . this would be for october forward . wagner thinks there may be additional refunds ordered later . wagner has also strongly advised ferc and bush ( as well as his top advisors ) that they will have to put price caps on , stick with them and show real efforts to deal with this issue ( even though those steps run afoul of the " free market " position of the admin - - and his own members ) . he has a great deal of influence with bush . mou & pan b late thursday ( 7 / 12 ) assembly speaker robert hertzberg called a briefing for business community leaders regarding a new proposal to alter the terms of the edison mou . the new proposal ( now abxx 82 ) reduces the value of socal ' s transmission system to 2 times book value ( the state had previously agreed to pay 2 . 3 times the book value , or $ 2 . 76 b ) . given the dire financial condition of the socal edison ' s parent company ( eix ) , the legislature now realizes that they are unlikely to see any cash infusion above the $ 420 m already promised by eix . assembly moderate democrats led by keeley and hertzberg feel that a $ 4 . 5 b generator refund , a profit from the state ' s sale of the socal transmission lines , and an additional $ 1 b from a dedicated rate component are all distant , but hopeful possibilities that could fuel progress for a socal bail - out . of course , two thirds of these suggestions require ferc approval . pg therefore , in order to save socal from bankruptcy , the legislation governing dwr ' s power purchases will likely have to be revised .

" eei urges epa to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues , " said paul bailey , eei vice president , environmental affairs . given these uncertainties , eei is disappointed that the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science , " said mr . bailey . " in the meantime , the electric power industry will continue to work with all stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions from power plants may be needed , and how those cuts should be achieved , " mr . bailey concluded . mergers & acquisitions * * * calpine completes acquisition of emi power assets * * * calpine corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of power assets from energy management , inc . ( emi ) . in the deal , calpine acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed , combined - cycle power generating facilities located in new england , as well as a joint marketing venture between calpine and emi . prior to the transaction , calpine held a 50 percent net interest in the projects . " we are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and highly efficient power plants . the dighton , tiverton , and rumford facilities were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in new england , " said calpine senior vice president bob alff . " combined with our other announced project in the northeast , we have created a coordinated system of low - cost assets , with excellent geographic diversity , to provide power to a very attractive new england market , " added alff . * * * exelon completes acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of sithe * * * exelon corporation and sithe energies have announced the completion of exelon ' s acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of the stock of sithe . the completion of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which peco energy company agreed to purchase 49 . 9 percent of sithe ' s assets in north america for $ 682 million . peco has since merged with unicom corporation to form exelon corporation . under the terms of the agreement , exelon has the option to purchase the remaining 50 . 1 percent of sithe within two to five years at a price based on prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised . exelon and sithe will continue to operate independently , said the companies . energy data * * * weekly electric output ( week 50 ) * * * electric output reached 74 , 737 gwh for the week ending december 9 ( week 50 ) , with the highest increase over 1999 levels in the mid - atlantic region , which had a 15 . 8 percent increase over 1999 . looking at year - to - date information , the pacific southeast leads the nation in growth of output . for more information , email alliance @ eei . org . who ' s who * * * allegheny energy announces leadership change * * * allegheny energy , inc . this week announced the appointment of michael morrell , senior vice president and cfo , as president of its unregulated supply business , allegheny energy supply company , effective february 1 , 2001 . morrell will replace peter skrgic , current president , who will be retiring on that date after 37 years of service to the company . in his new position , mr . morrell will direct and continue the growth of allegheny ' s energy supply business , which operates and markets competitive retail and wholesale electric generation throughout the eastern us . additionally , morrell will identify new opportunities to expand the company ' s generation holdings , announced a press release . the alliance express is a free news service sponsored by the alliance of energy suppliers . this document can be redistributed . please send questions , comments , or requests to alliance @ eei . org , or telephone 202 / 508 - 5680 . * * * due to the holidays , the alliance express will not be published next tuesday , december 26 .   recent ferc filings   ( 1 ) rto developments * the following entities filed comments regarding the california wholesale electric market . elo 0 - 95 - 000 , et . al . filed december 13 , 2000 . - american public power assoc . : " market power : will we know it when we see it ? the california experience " - southern california edison co . : " proof that soft price caps do not result in lawful rates " and request for rehearing - southern california edison co . : request for immediate modification of the december 8 , 2000 order - san diego gas & electric : motion to clarify the record * the following entities filed motions for an immediate modification and to intervene regarding the commission ' s emergency order december 8 approving the ca iso ' s tariff amendments . erol - 607 - 000 , ero 0 - 95 - 000 et . al . filed december 13 , 2000 . - western power trading forum - reliant energy power generation - pacific gas and electric - ca iso - dynegy power marketing * southern energy companies filed a supplemental protest regarding pjm ' s order 2000 compliance filing . rtol - 2 - 000 . filed december 14 , 2000 .

" we do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to edison ' s svp of regulatory affairs and here ' s a summary : the commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 any " overcollection " resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $ 3 . 3 b in edison ' s past due accounts ( the so - called " undercollection " ) if edison collects the $ 3 . 3 b prior to 2003 , then rates can change if edison has not collected the $ 3 . 3 b by the end of 2003 , the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder . half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005 . any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $ 3 . 3 b undercollection . edison can keep 10 % of any refunds received after the $ 3 . 3 b is paid off . edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $ 3 . 3 b . edison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk . edison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs ( i . e . , if dwr ' s costs go up , the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison ' s rates ) the puc will not fine edison during this period if edison ' s capital structure varies from the puc - approved capital structure edison must drop its lawsuits against the puc regarding 1 ) the " filed rate doctrine " and 2 ) the so - called " turn " accounting method , which effectively kept the rate freeze in place . edison agrees to " cooperate " with the attorney general and the puc in all litigation against suppliers . the puc decision could likely nullify the need for the " special " session that the governor recently announced we will report back with additional details as soon as we get them . best , jeff - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dasovich , jeff sent : tuesday , october 02 , 2001 2 : 45 pm to : kean , steven j . ; belden , tim ; sharp , vicki ; blachman , jeremy ; comnes , alan ; tribolet , michael ; walsh , kristin ; delainey , david ; leff , dan ; frazier , lamar ; keeney , kevin ; gahn , scott ; swain , steve ; lavorato , john ; kaufman , paul ; steffes , james d . ; calger , christopher f . ; mara , susan ; black , don ; richter , jeff ; kitchen , louise ; dietrich , janet ; mara , susan ; robertson , linda ; kingerski , harry ; denne , karen ; palmer , mark a .

2	Subject: alex tartakovski as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office . i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight , but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 . by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to fill in some of the " vacants " in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 ) coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 ) modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between " my " group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research . over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time - ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him working both on pricing research and this specific business unit . i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m not sure of this . this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are useful to us are : probability / statistical model development development of theoretical pricing methodology excellent computer programming skills database development and data analysis he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of mike curley , the nerc data manager . designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt . excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to hedging insurance portfolios . if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards . can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real tank through a minefield ) . one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job in morgan stanley ' s equity dept . we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the office for that , so we can do that next week . please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway . thanks , - - dave

mail category : alert product line : latin american energy url : summary : the opening of brazil ' s upstream oil sector has taken another step forward this week following the successful anp auction of 21 blocks . this bidding round comes one year after anp ' s first round , held in june 1999 . the bid was well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in brazil . although the anp collected lower participation fees than in the first round ( us $ 9 . 0 million compared with us $ 9 . 8 million in the first round ) , the second round was generally considered a success . cera alert : 06 / 16 / 2000 title : brazilian power markets : demand recovery gathers steam but supply questions remain author : bailey , mattos e - mail category : alert product line : latin american energy url : summary : brazil ' s power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000 . february demand was 6 . 8 percent over february 1999 levels , and march demand grew a further 7 . 6 percent above the previous year . the industrial sector continued to lead the recovery with year - to - date demand growing 9 . 8 percent over 1999 , and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7 . 5 percent over a similar period . as demand growth strengthened , hydro power generation increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in january . hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by the end of april , signaling the end of the wet season . with rapidly increasing demand , particularly in the south and southeast regions , brazil could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several months are delayed . cera decision brief : 06 / 20 / 2000 title : mexico after the elections : the real battle begins author : puyana e - mail category : decision brief product line : latin american energy url : summary : for the first time in many decades , the presidential and parliamentary campaigns are highly competitive , and the results of these democratically conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future of the new administration . however , the real political battle begins after the elections . indeed , the winning party will have to exercise all its political skills to create coalitions and advance negotiations in order to take control of the government . three different scenarios are portrayed in this cera decision brief . cera decision brief : 06 / 26 / 2000 title : colombia : weary of war , wary of peace author : puyana , scott e - mail category : decision brief product line : latin american energy url : summary : july 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then president - elect andres pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the armed revolutionary forces of colombia ( farc ) , manuel marulanda . two years later , the country is no closer to peace , and resolution of the ongoing negotiations is uncertain at best . this prolongation and stagnation of the peace process has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in colombia . the government will likely proceed with formal negotiations , but time - - and pastrana ' s remaining term in office - - is running out . cera alert : 06 / 30 / 2000 title : argentine power markets : winter constraints push prices higher in may author : bailey e - mail category : alert product line : latin american energy url : summary : prices in the argentine power market were significantly higher in may owing to the combination of continued low hydro output , strong demand growth , and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the buenos aires region . spot power prices ( energy component only ) averaged $ 18 . 24 per megawatt - hour ( mwh ) in may . although average power prices declined from last year , price volatility increased , with several short - duration episodes of prices over $ 60 per mwh as gas unavailability in the buenos aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours . in june , prices are expected to continue strengthening to the $ 24 - $ 28 per mwh range on average . beyond june , price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output , new and returning low - cost thermal capacity , and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward $ 15 per mwh or below by august or september . cera alert : 06 / 01 / 2000 title : us gas markets reach new heights : where will it stop ? author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas url : summary : the us gas market enters the month of june with prices at the highest level since deregulation . at the henry hub prices have surged to as high as $ 4 . 50 per mmbtu - - up from less than $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu during april . behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply , the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation . the gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories , with injections so far this spring running between 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 bcf per day below last year ' s rate . the continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer , and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand . cera alert : 06 / 15 / 2000 title : monthly briefing - - the pressure cooker author : n . american natural gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas url : summary : pressure remains extremely strong in the united states gas market as three factors - - the increasing power generation demand , lower storage inventories , and us wellhead supply still struggling to rebound - - call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter . prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets , making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years . in this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer - - with pressure increasing into july as temperatures rise - - with the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end - use demand . cera expects a july average price of $ 4 . 45 per mmbtu . cera decision brief : 06 / 15 / 2000 title : western canada supply growth : getting nowhere faster author : eynon , small e - mail category : decision brief product line : north american gas url : summary : as us supply declines and demand grows , current high gas prices are reinforced , but western canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most . both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results . the largely weather - related transitory factors have had a near - term impact on drilling and connection activity . the underlying trends have been developing slowly over time . more shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates . thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production . with a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling , higher supply growth rates are possible , but if that does not occur , other potential supply sources may step in . significant arctic reserves in the mckenzie delta and the alaskan north slope are once again entering the spotlight . coal bed methane has become a str ! ong source of us supply . although now ignored in canada , it may become a future source of canadian gas . cera watch : 06 / 20 / 2000 title : reaching new heights author : n . american natural gas team e - mail category : watch product line : north american gas url : summary : fundamentals have taken center stage , as building demand pressure accompanies us supply declines . storage inventories have been significantly reduced , and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months . demand - driven growth continues , as completions of gas - fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10 , 000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand . the result is a higher - price playing field for natural gas , with the average henry hub price likely to reach $ 3 . 67 per mmbtu for 2000 - - its highest level since the development of spot markets . cera private report : 06 / 21 / 2000 title : closing the utility stock valuation gap : does strategy matter ? author : parshley e - mail category : private report product line : north american power url : summary : the stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry . traditionally undervalued in the market , the sector is trading at a historically wide 50 percent discount to standard and poor ' s s & p 500 . the s & p utility index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent , with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 electric utilities . yet early this year , the spu outpaced all other industry groups . how should constantly evolving utilities in this wide - open sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success ? the value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999 - - a record $ 50 billion - - was double the 1998 value . but are these choices ahead of the curve ? and when will the market catch up ? three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape : multiservice and technology providers , superregionals , and global power and ! energy companies . three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges . cera decision brief : 06 / 23 / 2000 title : the summer 2000 spot electricity markets outlook : divergent trends in price volatility author : makovich , sannicandro e - mail category : decision brief product line : north american power url : summary : while several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer , other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supply - demand balances improve dramatically . one way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations . therefore , forward prices for on - peak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high as - - or even higher than - - in 1999 . a significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets . cera alert : 06 / 02 / 2000 title : atlantic basin gasoline markets soar author : meyers e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season , spot gasoline - to - crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the gulf war . in cera ' s view , this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors : very low inventories , tightening gasoline specifications , and legal uncertainty . cera alert : 06 / 13 / 2000 title : refined products line - - us markets author : refined products team e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : the us gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during may . us gulf coast unleaded gasoline surged to $ 8 . 40 per barrel measured against wti , up $ 3 . 58 per barrel over the strong april value of $ 4 . 82 . apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to 8 . 64 million barrels per day ( mbd ) in response to the start of the summer driving season . despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jet / kerosene , these markets did not experience the same month - over - month strength in differentials , dropping to $ 1 . 58 and $ 2 . 58 per barrel versus wti , respectively . cera alert : 06 / 20 / 2000 title : refined products line - - european markets author : refined products team e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : as higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to brent and thus lower refinery margins , refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs . however , very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products ' values . meanwhile , fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in may , driving down simple / hydroskimming margins . in recent weeks , the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover . this has pushed margins to above may ' s averages , although still below april ' s peaks . cera alert : 06 / 26 / 2000 title : recent actions signal progress toward mtbe elimination author : stackpole e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : the close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline ( rfg ) now faces from the media and public officials owing to midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether ( mtbe ) use in the us gasoline pool . additional signposts , including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating mtbe use and state actions to ban mtbe , continue to emerge that point the way toward mtbe - free gasoline in the united states . cera alert : 06 / 29 / 2000 title : refined products : market update author : refined products team e - mail category : alert product line : refined products url : summary : refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences . in the atlantic basin , low gasoline inventories in both the united states and europe , which resulted from many months of opec production restraint , continue to dominate the market , and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years . although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the north american market in the coming month , the 2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by atlantic basin refiners in many years . in contrast , asia pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of june , until the recent accident at kpc ' s mina al - ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt singapore margins . however , with ample unused refining capacity available east of suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the kpc refinery in july , cera ' s outlook is for that strength to be of short duration . cera alert : 06 / 23 / 2000 title : new peaks , new prices author : zenker , moritzburke , snyder e - mail category : alert product line : western energy url : summary : in the west , july typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices . cera expect the west to be the only region in north america with a year - over - year increase in peak electricity demand . power prices already established new record highs in june , suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year ' s levels . the convergence of higher gas prices , growing power demand , and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up western power prices . greater utilization of gas - fired generators within the west has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout north america . western gas prices should continue to be strong , boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across north america to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer ! power loads . cera alert : 06 / 15 / 2000 title : oil market turmoil : opec seeks a short - term fix author : world oil team e - mail category : alert product line : world oil url : summary : driven by strong demand - - especially in the recovering asian economies and the united states - - oil prices ( both wti and brent ) have again broken the $ 30 level - - a mark that is of particular significance in this us election year . in turn , the oil market ' s attention is again fixed on opec , as it prepares for its june 21 meeting , but its members are deeply divided over how to respond . cera alert : 06 / 16 / 2000 title : the state of the oil market : market supported , psychology enhanced , and opec driven author : world oil team e - mail category : alert product line : world oil url : summary : the key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new opec - - and its successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind demand - driving inventories down for crude , with the side effect of lowering stocks for several products in markets such as the united states and europe . three features of the current oil market are supporting prices : * market supported * psychology enhanced * opec driven cera alert : 06 / 22 / 2000 title : opec ' s cautious new agreement author : world oil team e - mail category : alert product line : world oil url : summary : opec ' s agreement to raise its production quota beginning july 1 by 708 , 000 barrels per day to 25 . 4 million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels . the gain in supply is a short - term fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below $ 30 but keep them in a mid - to upper $ 20 s range . * * end * * follow url for html version of this message only . note : should the above url not work , please use the following : account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e -

2	Subject: california update 3 / 16 / 01 ? a source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coram energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week . through an intermediary , we were able to corroborate this information with a senior member of the ca iso board . coram energy is a relatively small wind generator qf based in west vancouver , british columbia , though it also owns wind stations in california . coram has 238 40 kw units . ? the source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis to be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature . it is unlikely that blackouts would happen in april or may , meaning a long wait for the cash strapped qfs to wait to get paid . ? the filing will be against socal . ? in order to file an involuntary bankruptcy , coram would have to file along with at least two other creditors owed $ 10 , 000 or more . sources report coram has two other creditors who will file with them ( working on finding out who they are ) . ? sources also report that other qfs are " taking legal advice " on how to proceed in light of these developments .

placed sources in the government , the company has informed the madhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports had indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 . according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representatives of its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied the current power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the present tariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal of dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debt restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable to enron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole committee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time to renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa . the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far in excess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta is on take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whose capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay . it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the power generation . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf . instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  , s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entire capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says the committee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out the harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lng contract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that since the lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices are concerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys and renegotiate the contract accordingly . -

led re - negotiation committee set - up to facilitate the restructuring of the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between the us power major and the state government . officials of dabhol power company ( dpc ) , a subsidiary of enron , alongwith their team of shareholders and lenders will arrive here on may 11 for talks with the nine - member godbole panel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a key mantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio . enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board of directors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve a termination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for defaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led by industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed the move to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand taken by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress - led democratic front government had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of both the parties . last week , the state government constituted a nine - member panel of experts under former bureaucrat madhav godbole . godbole had written to the dpc management inviting it for talks to re - negotiate the ppa on may 5 . for the delayed response from enron , the meeting has been rescheduled to may 11 . the issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the lng facility from the power plant , renegotiating lng supply and shipping agreements , redefining the dpc tariff and to convert it into a two - part tariff . the godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the maharashtra government to sell power to third parties . - - - - - - -

arrival of its team from houston and other parts of the world . however , the company has ultimately decided to meet the godbole committee on may 11 . dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said :  & we confirm that dpc has been invited to meet the recently formed negotiating committee . as a matter of courtesy , we have agreed to meet them next week . since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts , we will not present any proposals .  8  & while we have constantly maintained that we are open to a dialogue towards resolving issues , this meeting in no manner be construed as an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract . furthermore , the published terms report do not represent an acceptable basis for further discussions ,  8 he added . sources said enron corp chairman kenneth lay is likely to meet former chief minister sharad pawar to find an acceptable solution for the ongoing crisis before the may 11 meet . mr lay told the foreign news agency on wednesday that the enron corp has no immediate plans to sell its stake in the troubled $ 2 . 9 -

( ene ) continued to struggle tuesday to find willing sellers of near - term gas and power in north america , but the one - time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis , according to market sources . " it ' s not getting any better , " said one major energy broker . many energy trading companies aren ' t selling to enron and are only buying from it near - term . these include aquila inc . ( ila ) , mirant ( mir ) , royal dutch / shell group ( rd ) subsidiary coral energy , sempra energy ( sre ) , and morgan stanley dean witter ' s energy trading subsidiary , said the broker . the broker estimated enron ' s over - the - counter trading volume to be about 25 % of what it was a month ago . companies are willing to buy from enron in the spot gas and power markets , because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer . some other companies , like dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , duke energy corp . ( duk ) and bp plc . ( bp ) , continue to trade with enron fairly freely , the broker said . dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire enron , though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated . the trading subsidiaries of troubled california utility - holding companies pg & e corp . ( pcg ) and edison international ( eix ) also are trading with enron . the third and largest group of companies are trading with enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off - setting trades against deals done long ago . these include el paso corp . ( epg ) , reliant resources ( rri ) , tractebel sa ' s ( b . trb ) u . s . trading unit and regulated utilities , the broker said . several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than enron was offering . " they ' ve been cut off from so many people , " said one electricity trader . enron says just slight reduction in transactions an enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25 % of the one - month - ago level . the notional value of enron ' s 30 - day rolling average of transactions is $ 2 . 8 billion , said enron spokesman eric thode . thode declined to give volume data for tuesday or monday , although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago . " we ' re not doing daily information . we ' re only speaking in terms of 30 - day rolling averages . . . . it ' s not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility , " thode said . traders and brokers said they hope dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to enron ' s trading to restore confidence . but , after enron ' s ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse nov . 20 , dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed . energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month , as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75 % drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk - rated debt . but enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the u . s . securities exchange commission . for the first time since enron ' s troubles began a month ago , energy companies stopped selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing . moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s all rate enron one notch above speculative grade . moody ' s has enron ' s ratings on review for a downgrade , and s 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com ( john edmiston in houston and jon kamp in chicago also contributed to this article . ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 3 - dynegy says in talks on enron merger structure . by c . bryson hull 11 / 27 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 27 ( reuters ) - energy trader dynegy inc . confirmed on tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival enron corp . over their proposed merger , as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent . " i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal , " dynegy spokesman john sousa told reuters . he declined to give further details . dynegy had planned to buy its houston rival for $ 9 billion in stock and is currently in a " due diligence " examination of enron ' s complex financial books that began before the thanksgiving holiday last thursday . the buyout offer , finalized nov . 9 , would have had dynegy paying about $ 10 . 41 for each share of enron , but enron ' s shares have since cratered to near $ 4 , stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all . the stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0 . 2685 of each dynegy share for each enron share to around 0 . 15 instead , sources familiar with the matter told reuters . enron is willing to accept the lower valuation , given the pressure on its stock price , the sources said . enron ' s shares bounced on dynegy ' s confirmation of the restructuring talks , trading up 22 cents at $ 4 . 23 in late afternoon action on the new york stock exchange . the shares had dipped as low as $ 3 . 84 in late - morning dealings and as high $ 4 . 49 . dynegy ' s shares gained 4 . 7 percent or $ 1 . 83 to move to $ 41 . 08 on the nyse . also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of enron ' s debt past the close of the merger , expected in the third quarter of 2002 . the sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $ 500 million in cash , which enron has said it was seeking . there also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the northern natural gas pipeline , which would be dynegy ' s consolation prize if the deal fell apart , a source said . published reports have said that investment banks j . p . morgan and salomon smith barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans , and may dispute dynegy ' s ownership if the deal breaks up . " the pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized . there ' s a solid earnings stream from that thing , " said one source familiar with the discussions . one trading unit shut down two sources confirmed to reuters that enron ' s equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off . enron was not immediately available for comment . those layoffs , part of broader job cuts expected as part of the dynegy buyout , point to an acute problem for enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise . enron ' s trading partners have been cutting back transactions with north america ' s largest energy trader because of credit concerns . " this business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth . it is the principal reason that dynegy is making the deal . if it ' s worth a lot less then enron is worth less . it ' s vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business , " said commerzbank analyst andre meade . but as enron ' s stock continued to lose value , down over 50 percent since dynegy ' s initial bid , it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well . enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $ 3 billion , from $ 60 billion at the start of 2001 .

" enron is a black hole , and i don ' t know how deep the bottom is , " said fadel gheit an analyst at fahnestock & co . only four weeks ago , enron ' s stock was trading at the 8 usd mark , gheit said , noting that if the dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse . " the market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure , it could be several billion dollars , " said gheit . if the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock - exchange ratio , said gheit . under the current acquisition agreement , dynegy would exchange 0 . 2685 share for each enron share tendered . according to the wall street journal , the new ratio is expected to be less than 0 . 15 share of dynegy stock for every share of enron stock , which would value enron at less than 6 usd a share , or about 5 bln usd . blms / cl / gc copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . in the money : hedge funds say yes to new enron terms by carol s . remond 11 / 27 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) a dow jones newswires column new york - ( dow jones ) - news that enron corp .

' ' under current terms , the deal makes sense for dynegy only if enron earns 85 cents or more next year , said gordon howald , an analyst at credit lyonnais who rates dynegy a ` ` buy . ' ' ubs warburg ' s barone has reduced his estimate of enron ' s 2002 earnings to 75 cents a share from $ 1 . 65 . enron needs an infusion in part because it has $ 9 billion of payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $ 2 billion in cash and credit lines . the decline in reserves has also raised the prospect that moody ' s investors service may cut enron ' s credit rating . a lower rating would trigger $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships . cash question ` ` the main question is : ` what is the cash position right now ? ' ' ' said tice at deutsche bank . ` ` is the falloff in the cash position of the company stabilizing or not ?

' ' ` ` if they announce they ' ve renegotiated the deal , it will be implicit that due diligence has been done , and that dynegy won ' t walk away for anything that ' s happened up until now . if they were to impose more conditions , what good is that ? dynegy needs to resuscitate enron back to health .

' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how should the measurements be presented , etc . ) . in short - rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the current , best - effort internet . - rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement

' s planned acquisition of enron . mr . lay ' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice . early in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay ' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities . but by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn ' t attend the traders ' meeting , senior managers told him that " opinions were expressed that he shouldn ' t receive the payment , " mr . palmer said . " he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . " the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day . the initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . " things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , " mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director . for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation . enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies . separately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board " failed in its responsibility " to monitor the activities of enron executives . mr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling ' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 . under the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million . mr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn ' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron ' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay ' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay . mr . palmer said it is a " cheap shot " to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . " the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , " mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing " the very best service possible . " mark lay couldn ' t be reached for comment . coming on top of disclosures of enron ' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron ' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships . mark lay ' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and " certain other individuals " who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron ' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up " a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , " according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron ' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business . as part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to " convey " to enron " certain intangible property rights " from ppmc . mark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer . since 1985 , sharon lay ' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm ' s revenue in some years . she said her brother ' s position was " more a problem " than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn ' t worked hard enough to get enron ' s business .

2	Subject: request for transfer assistance from : dr . ben kokori compliments of the season . i would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter . before going into details of my proposal to you , i must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality , as this is required for its success . my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of nigeria  s contracts review panel ( crp ) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the central bank of nigeria . in order to commence this transaction , we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds . we are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002 . the source of the funds is as follows : during the last military regime in nigeria , government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over - invoiced in various ministries and parastatals . the present civilian government set up the contract review panel , which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel , to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts . my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the central bank of nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes . however , by virtue of our positions as civil servants ! and members of this panel , we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in nigeria . i have therefore been mandated , as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel , to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of u . s . $ 25 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twenty five million , five hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) . that is why i am writing you this letter . we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account , if you agree with our proposition as follows ; ( i ) 20 % to the account owner ( you ) . ( ii ) 70 % for us ( the panel officials ( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by both you and us ) incidental to the actualization of this project . we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please note that this transaction is 100 % safe and risk - free . we intend to effect the transfer within fourteen ( 14 ) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above _ - : your bank ' s name , company  s name , address , telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which the funds should be paid . the above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively . this way , we will use your company  s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company . we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my america internet fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only . it was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality . i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when i hear from you . best regards , ben kokori

" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

reem fahey , edison mission ; carol guthrie , chevron / texaco ; shmuel oren , university of california - berkley and advises texas puc ; andy ott , pjm ; michael schnitzer , northbridge group . general observations the commissioners were again all present ( wood left mid - morning to give testimony on capitol hill ) . today , however , ferc staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions . the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again . this will probably continue for the rest of the week . what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts , most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp . very few panelists have opposed this ; at most , a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized - - basically conceding that pjm ' s system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else . locational marginal pricing the panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary ( schmuel oren does not oppose it ) . most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos . andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized . carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect . she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works . ftrs versus flowgates the panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial , not physical . schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear . most of the panelists , including the psc commissioner , prefer ftrs rather than flowgates . schmuel is a flowgate advocate . after some discussion , the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together , provided that the definition of flowgate is understood . andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs ( liquidity , standard product ) , and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point - to - point rights , then ftrs and flowgates can coexist . if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights , it ' s okay . however , if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling , the two cannot coexist . schmuel seemed to agree with this premise , although this is not his preference . he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs . brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs . the panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load , but the method of allocation was not agreed upon . ferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates . many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate , and what happens when circumstances change over time , resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant . schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates , but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged , use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable . the panelists agreed that these financial rights ( either ftrs or flowgates ) should be tradable in the secondary market . the panelists disagreed on which instrument - - ftrs or flowgates - - are more tradable . andy thinks ftrs are more tradable ; schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable . options versus obligations the panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow . andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated . schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front . the afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion . steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly . let me know if you have any questions . sarah

but at least it cannot be isolated to one problem . also , due to multiple systems ( sitara , enpower , gasdesk , tagg / erms , powerdesk ) are listening for messages from one enrononline , a " bridge " problem could be one of many issues . some of which are : the server for enrononline messenger goes down ( doesn ' t send message to bridge to process ) the enron network goes down ( cannot send message thru bridge ) the nfs server ( enron main server ) goes down sitara server goes down enpower server goes down tagg / erms server goes down deal worker in any system gets " hung up " huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re - started on sunday and the list goes on . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fyi in the past week & 1 / 2 , the following actions happened , which caused " bridge " problems . scheduled outage for maintenance on tagg / erms server on weekend was not re - started on sunday ( not smart ) the nfs server ( enron main server ) goes down ( affected sitara & tagg / erms ) deal worker in sitara system got " hung up " and servers had to be bounced member of enrononline dev team changed data for specific tokenised periods during trading hours instead of end of day ( this failed deals in bridge for sitara & tagg / erms ) one thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office . traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their position manager application of their system . if they are gas traders , if could be sitara or tagg system . if they are a power trader calling , they cannot see it in enpower . ecetera , ecetera if a back office person calls , they are watching the monitor gui and they can see deals queing / backing up and know there is a problem . we are working to resolve some of these issues , particularily , multi - processing tools , as we know the # of transactions will only increase . please feel free to email me if you have any questions . i hope this was helpful . see below for explanation of problem on wednesday . -

2	Subject: california update 08 . 22 . 01 though announced yesterday that davis and the assembly democratic leadership had cut a deal on an mou for edison , considerable uncertainty remains : the legislative language describing " the deal " still has not been released . ( we ' ll get the details out just as soon as they are available . ) of the provisions rumored to be in the deal , burton ( democratic leader in the senate ) has said publicly that spreading the utility undercollection over customers 20 kw and higher is a " nonstarter in the senate " . ( the senate bill forces 500 kw - and - above customers to pay for edison ' s undercollection ( which amounts to about 3600 customers behind edison . wall street has said that 3600 customers is insufficient to securitize the undercollection . ) . unless the costs are spread across 20 kw - and - above customers , business is likely to oppose the bill strongly . business may also oppose the bill if it doesn ' t provide for " meaningful " direct access and self - gen , but at this point business seems to care more about spreading the undercollection than direct access . there is no indication yet that davis and the democratic leadership in the assembly have convinced a majority of assembly democracts to vote for the deal ; but davis is pushing very hard and the assumption is that he ' ll get the votes in the assembly if he continues to push . however , given burton ' s comments , it ' s unclear whether the senate goes along , even if davis manages to push something through the assembly . but if davis and the assembly want it badly enough , the likelihood is that they will pass a bill that meets burton ' s requirements and that burton will move through the senate . bryson , ceo of edison , has said publicly that he doesn ' t know whether the deal will make edison solvent . consumer groups are strongly opposed to any deal for edison , saying 1 ) bankruptcy ' s the best answer and 2 ) they will run " the mother of all ballot initiatives " to roll back any " bailout . " as of 1 : 06 pm cdt , pcg is trading at 16 . 47 ( down 0 . 07 ) ; edison ' s trading at 13 . 94 ( down 0 . 07 ) . best , jeff

2	Subject: california update - 9 / 4 / 2001 executive summary ? several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the edison mou . ? a snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome . procedural scenarios assembly the assembly appropriations committee ' s plan to take up sb 78 xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote . while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday ' s draft bill , it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend . if the problematic " shaver lake " provisions are removed from the bill , assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill ( although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition ) . if the shaver lake amendments remain , several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee . assembly speaker bob hertzberg supports this edison deal , and the business community supports some recent amendments . this likely mitigates concerns from other pro - business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions , hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) , but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass , and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close , a personal plea from him and / or the governor should enable him to get to 41 . senate the bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly ' s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb 78 xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal , but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) , and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position . this would lead to one of four scenarios : ? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate , and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th , ? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) , ? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support , ? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg , but as part of the deal , he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments , and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate . john burton is considered one of the smartest , and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today , so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally , external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance , the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits , drug courts , reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him , and given burton ' s past actions , he may string them along , holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything . governor assuming the bill escapes the senate ( and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it , regardless of edison ' s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it . consumer groups have vowed to undo any " edison bailout " enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions , or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx , making it as if the bill was never passed at all . initiative once drafted and submitted to the attorney general , it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary , and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days , the attorney general sends it to the proponents , the senate , the assembly , and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made . the proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however , the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election , on march 5 , 2002 ( statewide primaries ) , and so , could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 , 2002 . however the window is tight for that election , as well , and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 . the legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative , but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419 , 260 signatures ) . the ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers . it seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly , but harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights has been successful at placing pro - consumer initiatives on the ballot before , including prop . 9 in 1998 , which sought to undo ab 1890 before the public understood its ramifications . referendum referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives , although a successful referendum was on the march 7 , 2000 ballot . prior to that , the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the june 1982 primary election ballot . all four were defeated . since 1912 , there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot . of the 50 attempts , 39 qualified for the ballot , 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect . the circulation calendar , verification , timing , and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives . for example , the california constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred . the signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute , though . political dynamics notwithstanding the governor ' s and assembly speaker ' s desire to enact an edison rescue package , senate president pro tem john burton is in the driver ' s seat . in fact , as noted above , there is a perception among some that it is the governor who needs burton and not the other way around . one business source close to the negotiations believes burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an edison bailout . in fact , members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility , their reluctance fed by generators ' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout . currently , due largely to this dynamic and others such as the shaver lake issue , there are not 41 votes for an edison rescue in the assembly . we believe this will change as the governor and the speaker exert their influence , and the bill will pass the assembly . as difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the assembly , the state senate presents an even larger challenge . however , at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an edison rescue package being approved by the state senate are less than 50 percent .

2	Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents august , 2002 dear sir / madam , in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody . we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy - five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva . there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings : statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings : 01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . ) ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ . ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than 2 billion us $ per day . ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $  more than 730 us $ per year  more than 2 billion us $ per day ) theadvantages of the technology developed by us : a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially . b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression . by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all . c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced . as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be : 2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ . d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further . e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels . 3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion . f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind . g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind . h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future . i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also . . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options available to us : - a - outright sale ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration . ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in " a " . the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price . b - licencing options i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis . ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world . c - combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement . the economics of the project will be as follows : - 1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation . 2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle . but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided . 3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective . 4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles . 5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from . 6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency . 7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ . 8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date . 9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years . 10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle . 11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing . 12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate . p . s . 1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct . 2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

reduced fraud and errors safety control - of property - of facilities and assets convenience - no cards , keys or pin numbers to lose increased productivity - reduced admin costs - longer lived systems - reduction of errors and fraud - no ongoing card cost for replacement or additions our lives changed considerably after 9 / 11 and we as a country and around the world had to come to a realization that we were living amongst evils far beyond our cognitive imaginations . from the beheadings in iraq to the madrid train bombings we live in an age of international terrorism and no country is free from the threat . therefore in an effort to safeguard us against such threats , biometrics which by definition is the branch of biology that studies biological phenomena and observations by means of statistical analysis ( merriam webster ' s dictionary 10 th edition ) , has become an integral part of our daily existance . in lamens terms biometric products typically use details of an individual  s unique physical features  facial , eye or fingerprint patterns  to substantiate their identity . one such company that appears to be at the forefront of this industry is facekey corp . trading on the otc under the ticker symbol " feky " . headquartered in san antonio texas , this biometric company provides ' next generation ' security measures to governments and corporations utilizing patented and propietary technology that identify and allow access to personal . the company combines face and fingerprint recognition technology which can be used in both the public and private sectors . by combining face and fingerprint recognition technology , facekeys products can be used for a wide variety of applications . coo annete starkweather exclaims " by effectively combining both fingerprint and facial recognition , facekey is targeting the two largest revenue producing areas in the biometrics industry today while establishing patented technology to forge the future of biometric applications " . according to the international biometrics group ( ibg ) , an independent market research firm , the total biometrics market was $ 730 million in 2003 . of that , automated fingerprint identification systems ( afis ) claimed a 43 % market share and other fingerprint biometric solutions were a further 27 % for a total 70 % which is $ 511 million of the total biometric market for 2003 . afis is expected to remain the most accepted form of biometric identification due to large , established , historical databases in use internationally by law enforcement and border control . ibg anticipates that total fingerprint biometrics will claim over 53 % of the 2008 estimated market at a value of $ 2 . 6 billion totaling an average growth rate of 40 % for the projected period . facial recognition according to ibg is second behind fingerprint technology in revenues and has a staggering 74 % estimated growth rate over the next 4 years . coincidently facial and fingerprint recognition as dicussed above make up of the core concentration of facekey ' s biometric technology base . ibg projects biometrics to grow to approximately $ 4 . 8 billion by 2008 . currently , the biometric industry is in its early stages of growth but we believe government initiatives will act as a major catalyst towards global industry growth . for example on january 5 th of this year the u . s . - visitor and immigrant status indicator technology was implemented at 115 airports and 14 ship terminals , requiring u . s . customs officials to digitally photograph and fingerprint visa - carrying foreign nationals . data is compared against a government database of possible terrorists and people with criminal histories ( source : msnbc , roland jones 1 / 20 / 04 ) . citing another example the u . s . government is spending $ 25 million this fiscal year to road test a universal secure identity card loaded with biometric and personal data and tied to government " watch lists . " the card , known as the transportation worker identity credential ( twic ) , will allow workers at the nation ' s railways , ports , mass transit agencies and airports to carry a single card to access secure areas within these facilities ( source : msnbc brock meeks 12 / 10 / 04 ) . although we have focused alot of our discussion on biometrics and its impact on terrorism there is another area of focus that we have neglected here and that is occupational fraud . based on 2004 report findings by the association of certified fraud examiners ( acfe ) , the typical organization loses 6 percent of its annual revenues to occupational fraud . if multiplied by the u . s . gdp , which in 2003 was just under $ 11 trillion , it would translate into $ 660 billion in annual fraud losses . this is why facekey through its facial and fingerprint recognition technologies is also continuing to focus its efforts on combatting fraud . in a recent nationwide survey by authentic inc , a majority of u . s . consumers are willing to pay a premium to add fingerprint biometrics to their electronic devices - such as pcs and cell phones - to help make their life easier and more secure . the scientific survey of more than 2 , 000 adults , sponsored by biometrics leader authentec , shows that 63 percent of consumers would pay extra to add fingerprint biometrics to their pc and notebook computers , while 71 percent would pay more for this feature in their cellular phones . most consumers said they would use the technology to replace their pc and internet passwords , as well as to help transform their cell phones into their personal wallets to conduct m - commerce and wireless banking . " the survey shows that biometric sensors are a huge growth area . we are at the infancy of what will be a very large growth curve , heading toward biometric sensing devices becoming an important feature in consumer electronics , " said gary shapiro , president and ceo of the consumer electronics association . facekey currently offers three primary access control products which serve to increase security and reduce costs .  standard biometric access control system : uses fingerprint recognition technology as a secure identification method aiming to replace swipe card technologies and pin systems . this product offering can be upgraded to combine face a fingerprint recognition to provide a higher level of security  pc accesskey : utilizes fingerprint recognition to eliminate the need for passwords , access cards and keys when accessing pc ' s .  standard time and attendance system : increases profitability by collecting accurate information for payroll purposes and reducing reconciliation of paycheck errors . due to an emerging global market and facekey ' s ability to target both public and private sectors through there innovative facial and fingerprint recognition technologies we believe this company has the ability increase market share significantly . i think jp morgan ' s analyst paul coster says it best when he wrote in his september 2 nd 2004 research report " we think biometrics looks like a rising tide that should lift all boats .

2	Subject: your attention is needed attn : i pray this important message meets you in peace , may blessings of god be upon you and your family and grant you the wisdom to understand my situation and how much i really need your assistance . before i start let me introduce myself , my name is mrs . alice bamaiyi the wife of gen . musa bamaiyi nigeria ? s former army chief of staff and minister of defence under the military government of late head of state , gen . sanni abacha . since after my husband left office , the government has turned against my husband and his family with strange accusation . at first i thought it was a little vendetta from my husband ? s enemies but i was wrong . the present head of state , gen . olusegun obasanjo very much believed that it was my husband and the late head of state who put him in prison for plotting against their government and he is determined to have his own pound of flesh now . they arrested my husband and then they froze all our bank accounts known to them , hoping that we will starve to death why can ? t we all live in peace ? since i can ? t do anything in my position here , this is where you come in . my family is going through hardship , my husband is in jail and the remaining members of my family and myself where previously placed under house arrest before the timely intervention of the human organization . the new democratic president , olusegun obasanjo has seized more than us $ 45 million dollars already and they are still seizing a lot of land and property belonging to my family . all that is remaining now is us $ 19 . 2 million dollars , and this money has been kept in a place i cannot disclose , until we make personal contact . presently i am based in south africa with two of our kids trying to start a new life we cannot live comfortable again in nigeria so my husband advice that we move to one of his house in cape town pending when his travail will come an end and also we are being seriously watched by the new government . so after discussing with my senior son , and husband , this is what we plan to do with the money , we seek the assistance of a foreign partner with good background without any dealing with drug or terrorist activities to act as a front on our behalf we planned to send the fund to your country using a very good and reliable diplomatic courier / financial institution service in central europe . so this is why we need a foreign partner and your help . since you will be the one collecting the package in the country that it will be sent to , the sum will be shared in three ways . 20 % will be used to invest in your country or company while 30 % will be for you and the other 50 % will be for us . and also confidentiality is extremely important and before i forget once the sum arrives in the designated country ( which i will disclose to you later ) we will require you to send us an invitation letter to visit your country upon our release and collect our share . this is not a deal or business , it is cry for help . may god guide you ? when you reply please leave your contact details private phone and fax numbers for easy communications , my personal assistant and friend mr . pachico mzama will speak to you . he will relate all your messages to me , and if you wish to talk to me just tell him and he will make all the necessary arrangement . and for your own information you are not spending a cent or rand or dollar in this transaction i will personally take care of all financial matters as far as this transaction is concern and this money is drug free and 100 % risk free and very legitimate . please time is very paramount us , so your urgent response is needed . above , you will see my phone number , you can send me a email or call me but i would prefer email correspondence , but if you wish to discuss about anything you do not understand contact my family lawyer who is presently in europe on long vacation on this tel . number : 31 - 625 - 247 - 423 for more briefing and clarification . may god bless you ? mrs alice bamaiyi

[ ephesians 6 : 10 ] as you walk through the valley of the unknown , you will find the footprints of jesus both in front of you and beside you . the better i know men the more i admire dogs . i do not like the man who squanders life for fame give me the man who living makes a name . he who denies all , confesses all . fame is like a river , that beareth up things light and swollen , and drowns things weighty and solid . whoever slaps you on your right cheek , turn to him the other also . [ matthew 5 : 39 ] finance is the art of passing currency from hand to hand until it finally disappears . ambition never comes to an end . oh my son ' s my son till he gets him a wife , but my daughter ' s my daughter all her life . it ' s better to waste one ' s youth than to do nothing with it at all . honor is the reward of virtue . it belongs to the imperfection of everything human that man can only attain his desire by passing through its opposite . if the laws could speak for themselves , they would complain of the lawyers . some evils are cured by contempt . love is much like a wild rose , beautiful and calm , but willing to draw blood in its defense .

2	Subject: california 1 / 17 / 01 pt . ii one of the issues we have been following with respect to the california power crisis concerns the role of prospective broader federal involvement in the issue post - inauguration . in the last two days , we have seen two signals suggesting that the bush administration will not significantly deviate from the " broker " role played by the clinton white house : 1 . in his confirmation hearing this morning , treasury secretary - designate o ' neill cautioned that " it is not clear that us intervention is needed in california " and that the " governor must be the first line of defense . " 2 . a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us yesterday that " there was little that the federal government could do specifically to help , beyond focusing on national issues ( increased production , transmission capacity etc . ) . " of course , the bush treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with respect to intervention than the energy team , as was true with the clinton administration . yet lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from the official bush view at this stage . further guidance should be forthcoming with respect to this issue from energy secretary - designate spence abraham ' s testimony tomorrow .

" i would love to personally escort [ enron corp . chairman kenneth ] lay to an 8 - by - 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says , ' hi my name is spike , honey , ' " lockyer said . enron spokesman mark palmer called the comment " counterproductive rhetoric " that " does not merit a response . " but other industry representatives denounced the remark as " outrageous , " especially because neither lockyer ' s office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against enron or other companies . " you ' d expect that the state ' s chief legal counsel would file charges first and make public statements second , " said gary ackerman of the western power trading forum , an association of energy producers and traders . " we ' re very disappointed with his choice of words , which don ' t exactly fit the profile of his office . " in an interview tuesday , lockyer said he decided to " ratchet up " the commentary to " put [ energy companies ] on notice " that " we are not afraid of them and have the will to prosecute . " " what i ' m trying to do is let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them , they ' re going to be prosecuted , " lockyer said . " just because they ' re multimillionaires and run big corporations , it doesn ' t provide them with immunity . " the attorney general is investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market . several panels , including a state senate committee and the california public utilities commission , are conducting similar probes . on tuesday , lockyer announced that three power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators . the attorney general went to court to obtain the documents after the companies failed to meet a march 19 deadline to hand them over . lockyer said the forthcoming documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice laws . " evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity , " lockyer said . " but we need to make sure it ' s compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury . " lockyer said he singled out enron ' s chairman because the houston company is the world ' s largest energy trader . at least one observer found lockyer ' s comments refreshingly candid . harry snyder , a senior advocate of consumers union , said , " let lockyer be lockyer .

2	Subject: budget # ' s here is my first cut at taking the existing budget numbers to a desk - level . here are the key assumptions behind my cost allocations : direct costs for each group went to that group . gas ops was allocated to houston gas . power ops was allocated to east and west power based on commercial headcount . most other costs were allocated to gas , east power , west power , canada , ooc based on commercial headcount . there are a hundred ways you could do this exercise , i ' m not saying that this is the right way , but at least i was able to break the costs down . i then calculated an ebit by desk , funded a bonus pool , paid bonuses to all the non - commercial people , and figured out what a bonus pool would look like by desk based on the proforma values . i am not necessarily saying that this is the way that we should do it , but i think that it is one way to view the world upon which we can make whatever changes / adjustments we deem necessary . here are my initial conclusions / reactions : the proforma produces bonuses for commercial employees equal to roughly 6 % of their gross margin . this number is high relative to the 1 - 2 % we are used to , but considerably lower than the 8 % to 12 % that appears to be available in the market . our costs are way too high . for every dollar of direct commercial expenses there are four dollars of allocations . that just seems way out of hand . this model sells with lower costs . with current costs , i have a hard time convincing people in portland that this looks good relative to people ' s alternatives . i think that we need to have a lot of discussions next week on how this new organization would be managed . i don ' t see why we couldn ' t debate , if not nail down , a bunch of things next week . for example : how do we allocate var to the best performing traders and the market that offers the best opportunity at the time ? do we need to incent desk heads based on netco earnings while compensate traders based on desk earnings ? how will we carve up the bonus pool ? what are our choices ? what gets the var to the right places and properly incents teamwork ? how do we best manage costs ? how do we send appropriate cost signals for sunk costs ? for variable costs ? we need a very strong , professional , operations manager who is steeped in cost accounting , efficiency , quality control , and leadership . there is a science to operations management that i haven ' t seen applied at enron . for example , what does it cost us to schedule a mw - average and marginal ? what does it cost us to run a book ? what does it cost us to settle transactions ? what package are we going to be able to offer to incent people to stay ? when can we start talking about it ? who should we discuss this with ? what does our management team look like ? is it three people ? five people ? ten people ? i want to make this thing work . my clear first choice for 2002 is to be on this team . i want to be as contructive and helpful as possible in achieving this end . i can ' t commit unequivically ( sp ? ) until we sort out all of the numbers , i feel like i can sell this to the portland team , and i know what comp looks like for me and the key people in portland . i feel like some adjustments to the proforma and a clear understanding of 2002 comp will probably get us there . when do you want me in houston ( for a visit - not to move ) ? tim

2	Subject: adaptive trade vince , zimin , i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning . there was a possibility enron would invest in it . their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver ( and possibly ilog cplex ) which allows problems to be expressed in high level terms . i do not see any immediate application at enron , but i am interested in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo . maybe it would be useful for general modelling projects here . they do not even have a user manual for their software , so it will be difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged . the possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that market . i think the scheduling tools in sap , i 2 , etc are more likely to succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information system . because of the small market for this software , the many competitors , the absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development , there is very little prospect of us funding this company . tom

" the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy . the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco . chewco was established in 1997 " with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments " to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document . enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco . mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that " michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . " mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july . this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves " any director or executive officer . " by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have . however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a " material " piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and " other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management . " copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . deals & deal makers : enron officials sell shares amid stock - price slump by theo francis and cassell bryan - low staff reporters of the wall street journal 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 4 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) officials at enron corp . , whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny , have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year . corporate officials had sold 1 . 8 million shares valued at about $ 106 million through july , as the stock fell to less than $ 45 a share from $ 83 at the start of the year . since july , the stock has plummeted an additional 63 % to $ 16 . 35 , including a 50 % plunge since the beginning of last week . kenneth lay , chief executive of the houston energy - trading company , cashed in shares for $ 25 . 7 million so far this year , usually in transactions paired with options exercises . he sold 429 , 614 shares , leaving him with some 2 . 8 million shares as of july , the latest data available on his sales , according to thomson financial / lancer analytics . the dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all mr . lay ' s sales of enron shares for 2000 , which reached $ 30 . 7 million . in 1999 , he sold shares for a total of $ 26 million . in houston , an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures , saying the company doesn ' t keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials . enron also wouldn ' t comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales " a personal decision . " many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises . strong selling by company officers and directors amid share - price declines should raise red flags for investors , says jonathan moreland , research director of insiderinsights . com , who uses insider - trading data to zero in on investment ideas . among other insiders selling during the year , kenneth rice , former chairman and ceo of enron ' s broadband unit , sold shares for $ 23 . 7 million . mr . rice has sold 456 , 966 shares of the 1 . 5 million shares he was listed as owning in enron ' s march proxy filing . former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling - - who resigned in august - - sold 160 , 000 shares for $ 9 . 8 million during the year . in march , mr . skilling owned 1 . 9 million shares . messrs . rice and skilling couldn ' t be reached to comment . overall , enron ' s insiders were busier selling shares last year , when they sold 5 . 8 million shares for about $ 449 million . during 1999 , insiders sold 3 . 4 million shares for $ 123 . 1 million . since december 1999 , only one enron executive has reported buying company shares . the buyer was andrew fastow , who was ousted during the week as enron ' s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr . fastow . mr . fastow reported purchasing 10 , 000 enron shares in august at $ 36 . 98 each , or a total of $ 369 , 800 . today , those shares are valued at $ 163 , 500 , based on enron ' s stock price of $ 16 . 35 in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . after the purchase , mr . fastow owned 110 , 586 shares , thomson financial / lancer analytics says . enron said mr . fastow wasn ' t available to comment . on monday , a new york law firm filed suit in u . s . district court in houston , alleging that enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by mr . fastow . the suit , which seeks class - action status , also says enron insiders sold $ 73 million of their own enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets enron ' s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit - rating concerns by jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee staff reporters of the wall street journal 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 5 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - - enron corp . ' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse . not for long , some bond traders say . in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks . that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of " spread " is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower . enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade . fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer . " even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest , " said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j . in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a " default swap " - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year . even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level . yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to " negative , " citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . ) meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . " these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels , " said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . " they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction . " if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments . enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets . enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity . " even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating , the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses , " said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . " any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron ' s counterparties " - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - " is going to be examining their exposure to enron , and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it , " mr . reynolds said . to be sure , enron , despite its recent woes , remains a strong company , credit analysts said . " i don ' t think anyone ' s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default , " mr . reynolds said . " so far , our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them , " said ron barone , managing director of standard & poor ' s utility energy project finance group . " no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it ' s business as usual .

" so is this a stock to avoid , in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its " u . s . select list , " which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious " recommended list " of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 . " just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , ' " says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . " if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow . " enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week . " every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box , " says jim chanos , principal of kynikos associates in new york , who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . " it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . " true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had . but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ? concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions . besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings . through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a " strong buy " or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a " buy , " though not strongly . only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a " sell " rating on enron . the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted . over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue . enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch . " enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved , " says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a " strong buy " with a $ 40 price target . " they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . " he adds , " we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that ' s ludicrous . we ' re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes , i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don ' t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . " mr . fleischer , whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron , calls his holding " a meaningful investment " that is " not small . " but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients " are happy to know " he has a stake in enron , because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is . in his research note wednesday , mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company , he wrote that he and many other investors historically " have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings " and position as an industry leader . " there ' s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they ' re going to make their money , but every quarter they do , " he says . " it ' s hard to get inside to know all the transactions , but they do deliver . " csfb ' s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company , occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday , he wrote that he expects questions about enron ' s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue , but that he remains " confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . " " i know i ' m wrong on the stock , " mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices , he isn ' t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares , diluting current holders - - the stock doesn ' t have much further to fall . clearly , messrs . launer and flesicher aren ' t alone . " even in relative terms , analysts remain very bullish on this stock , " says chuck hill , director of research at thomson financial / first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 , or slightly shy of a " buy " rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . " this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out , " mr . hill says . in downgrading the stock this week , prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to " sell " from " buy , " with a brief stop at " hold . " while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock , she openly concedes her recent downgrades come " too little , too late . " ms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company ' s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal , and senior executives are often evasive , even when presented with direct questions . for instance , she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said " no , " she says . in light of the company ' s acknowledgment this week of an sec " inquiry , " she asked enron about the previous denial . " they told me it is an inquiry , not an investigation , " she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec ' s inquiry only last wednesday . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence 2001 - 10 - 26 08 : 52 ( new york ) enron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , whose stock has fallen on concern about the largest energy trader ' s transactions with affiliates , drew down $ 3 billion in credit to restore confidence in its financial strength . the houston - based company will use about $ 2 . 2 billion to pay off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash , spokesman mark palmer said . ` ` nothing instils confidence like cash , ' ' he said . enron ' s shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as investors worry that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . investors say they are worried about $ 3 . 3 billion in liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell enron assets . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the company $ 35 million . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay said in a statement . enron shares fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 yesterday . - - mark johnson in the princeton newsroom ( 609 ) 750 - 4662 , or at enron liked by analysts despite complicated dealings , wsj says 2001 - 10 - 26 06 : 12 ( new york ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is liked by many wall street analysts despite lingering questions about the power trading company ' s complicated partnership transactions and the techniques used to record earnings , the wall street journal reported in its ` ` heard on the street ' ' column . goldman sachs group inc . analyst david fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares , said that even though inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the company , that doesn ' t mean he will write off the industry or not analyze enron . of the 17 analysts who follow the stock , 10 had a ` ` strong buy ' ' or equivalent rating , according to thomson financial / first call , the paper said . five rated it ` ` buy ' ' and one had a ` ` sell ' ' on enron . most analysts have stuck by the company , publicly dismissing questions about enron ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure , the journal said . the securities and exchange commission is inquiring about partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . enron draws down $ 3 billion from its credit lines , wsj reports 2001 - 10 - 26 00 : 28 ( new york ) new york , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion of its available credit , the bulk of its bank credit lines , to restore confidence in the financial strength of the company , the wall street journal reported . the energy trading company , whose shares have fallen 52 percent since oct . 16 , will use part of the money to redeem about $ 1 . 85 billion short - term commercial debt , the wall street journal reported , citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter . enron is talking to banks about a new , multi - billion line of credit , the paper reported , citing the unidentified person . the steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is disrupted , the paper said . enron said in a statement distributed by pr newswire that it drew on its credit lines to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity . the steps come a day after chief financial officer andrew fastow resigned amid a securities and exchange commission probe of partnerships he ran . - - william selway in the san francisco newsroom at ( 415 ) 743 - 3511 , oct . 25 , 2001 , 11 : 22 pm houston chronicle action by enron halts stock ' s fall but credit ratings are being reviewed by laura goldberg copyright 2001 houston chronicle the recent freefall of enron corp .

' ' he spoke favorably of ' ' pro forma ' ' earnings reports , in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty . there was no mention of mr . levitt ' s concerns about improper management of earnings . on the heels of mr . pitt ' s speech , the s . e . c . used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors . the decision itself was reasonable , although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years . but the way the s . e . c . trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog .

' ' mr . pitt talks of companies ' ' getting it right the first time , ' ' which would certainly be nice . but there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting , figuring there will be no real penalty , like a restatement , if they are caught . that would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting . in trying to sound comforting to the accountants ' group - - an organization that , as he noted , he had represented as a lawyer for two decades - - mr . pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence . the proof , of course , will come in the performance . fortunately , the mess at enron gives the s . e . c . a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image . it will take time for the commission to determine if the company ' s accounting was proper . but there need be no delay in forcing enron to clearly explain - - rather than obfuscate as it has so far - - the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer .

" the economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists , " says betsy holahan , a department spokesperson . " war bonds are an additional way for americans to show their patriotism . " for the record , we don ' t think an issue of war bonds would be dumb , just superfluous . after all , nothing ' s stopped americans from buying generic savings bonds - - or better yet , treasuries - - all of which finance spending by the federal government . in the meantime , it ' s a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds - - which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice - - at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop . war bonds notwithstanding , we ' re a long way off from the era of ration books . 3 . enron again last week , we noted the extent of alarm about enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $ 1 . 2 billion , following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high - level transactions . following that disclosure , besieged cfo andrew fastow has finally left the company on what ' s delicately termed a " leave of absence . " in july , fastow exited a limited partnership , from which he had reportedly reaped large profits , after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement . concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence . but that won ' t be an easy task , given the resentment about enron ' s disinclination to explain its problems . one analyst called fastow ' s departure " unsettling , " noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before . sounding a note of exasperation , analysts at j . p . morgan chase , banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock . and there could be more trouble to come : the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions . 4 . gold diggers it ' s understandable that investors felt panicky in september . unfortunately , some reacted by shoving their hard - earned money into gold funds . according to financial research corp . , which tracks fund flows , the specialty precious - metals category was the best - selling equity category during september , with net inflows of $ 101 million . granted , that ' s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world . by comparison , during the same month , large growth funds saw net redemptions of $ 7 . 4 billion . but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy , given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long . sure , under the bizarre circumstances of late , they ' ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop . according to morningstar , the average precious - metals fund is up 10 . 08 % year to date . but over the past five years , the same category lost an embarrassing 14 . 68 % . by comparison , even large - cap growth funds - - everybody ' s favorite whipping boy - - managed to post a positive return . in the same period , they were up 7 . 13 % . moreover , circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades - - a combination of attacks on the u . s . government and war - - still don ' t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly . despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks , they ' re again approaching their pre - sept . 11 levels . it ' s too early to say , but it ' s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again . 5 . amazon amazes once again amazon ( amzn : nasdaq - news - commentary ) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter . well , at least it will post a pro forma operating profit . ok , so maybe that wouldn ' t include amazon ' s service on $ 2 . 17 billion in long - term debt or extraordinary charges . in fact , a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy , meaningless aura of minor triumph . the company still hasn ' t said when it will turn an economic profit . for that matter , even the fourth - quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit , cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier , " there are no guarantees .

" they created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn ' t come through with flying colors , " said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group in new york . enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old , which have little to do with the company ' s wholesale energy business , which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits . analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices . " even though ( enron ) shot themselves in the foot , the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear , " ellinghaus said . ubs warburg analyst ronald barone echoed that sentiment .

" it ' s business as usual , " said dynegy spokesman steve stengel . not for enron , whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india and the surprise departure in august of then - chief executive jeff skilling was considered another bad sign . on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . excluding the charge , enron earned $ 393 million on $ 47 . 6 billion in revenues for the three months ending sept . 30 . ellinghaus said the stocks of enron ' s competitors were brought down wednesday because of " dire " speculation that enron ' s troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as duke and dynegy . " all i ' m hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality , " ellinghaus said . enron did not return calls seeking comment thursday . donnell of duke energy said the charlotte , n . c . - based company is paying close attention to the enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid .

a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody , or any form of blackmail . d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from the total amount . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you . we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us . transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives . here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day , thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future , so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty . i will explain more to you when i have heard from you . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e - mail address . i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction . i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . tom eke . n . b . please be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering . this is a complete legitimate business transaction . - - 
2	Subject: re : financial confirm np 6050 . 1 thanks for your prompt response . i really hope that you can convince mark taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to calgary is the right thing to do . as you recall , we have been down the road of improving the service to calgary previously . this seems to work in the short term , but as soon as there is turnover in the group , which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly , the service level starts to drop . i would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to calgary when you meet with mark . first , when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to calgary , mark taylor ' s concern was our legal staff . at that time , we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area . we now have three very competent attorneys . greg johnston has spent time in houston and has recently attended an isda training course . second , there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by houston and with the process itself . at the time of the project doorstep audit , we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them . as you saw from my memo , confirmations are periodically sent out without our review . also , we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves , including the contract date referred to in the confirmation . the first two issues cause me a lot of concern . some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong , which is a big problem . we had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out , which is even a bigger problem . third , there is no real additional control in the process by having houston generate the confirmations . if you think about what the process is , the transactions are done in calgary , we fax the deal sheets to houston , the confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre - approved by legal , we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on - line if done by enron canada corp . , or send an e - mail if the enron entity is enron north america . houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty . if the counterparty is a trading company , houston follows up on the status of execution . for all other entities , the calgary office is now doing the follow - up . all these transactions are currently settled out of the calgary office . if the transactions were done in calgary , we would be using the same pre - approved templates that houston is using . it is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in houston , or , conversely , why there is any additional risk in having calgary prepare our own financial confirmations . if there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having calgary prepare the financial confirmations , why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations ? fourth , there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in houston while the review process is done in calgary . currently , houston has staff handling the calgary transactions . because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here , i have similar staff who print the confirmations , route them for review , update tagg , notify houston when the review is complete , and then follow - up with either houston or the counterparty on issues or execution . we are currently following up on all non - trading company financial confirmations . so , we are both printing and reviewing the transactions , following up with the counterparties , and filing these documents . as i stated before , calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff . fifth , there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in houston . because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth , the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the transaction being done . we feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here . this reduces risk for enron . finally , because we are a small office , i need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they don ' t feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base . given the skill sets of the documentation group , it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk , logistics , or accounting , so it is important that i am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group . because we review the confirmations , the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists . however , i know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function , and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations . as a final note , i report to you . i am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly . it would mean a lot to me , as well as the documentation staff , to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to calgary . mark taylor has never met me or my staff , yet i get the impression that he doesn ' t think we are capable of handling this function . i hope that you will be able to set him straight on this . he just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here . if you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo , please let me know . as you can see , the calgary office feels very strongly about this issue , including rob milthorp and peter keohane . please let me know how your meeting with mark goes . thanks , peggy enron north america corp . from : sally beck 07 / 19 / 2000 04 : 57 pm to : peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : financial confirm np 6050 . 1 i got your message and i have asked brent to get with me when he is back in the office on friday ( he has been in new york re : mg since monday night ) . together we will do two things : ( 1 ) devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to calgary starting immediately , and ( 2 ) work with mark taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to calgary and to eliminate his concerns . we will keep you posted on both items . -

2	Subject: requesting your urgent investment partnership dear friend , i am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you to transfer to your overseas account a huge amount of money deposited in one of the prime banks here in dakar - senegal . i urgently want to know you and if you are capable of handling and accomodate this magnitude of funds until i resign and come over to join you for an investment in your country . what i need is a reliable and honest individual / organisation that would be capable and fit enough to provide either an existing bank account or set up a new bank account immediately to receive this funds . even an empty bank account can serve to receive this funds as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this interest . my name is dr . salif mamadou , the director of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of the same bank . i am writing following the impressive information about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm . he assured me of your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity . in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 18 . 5 m usd eighteen million , five hundred thousand us dollars ) , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers an american by name : mr . neal walker who died along with other passengers in egyptair flight 990 - october 31 , 1999 . since we got information about his death , we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased and the person must be foreigner as indicated in our banking guidelines . futher investigation , we discovered that the owner of the account died without a [ heir / will ] hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . it is therefore upon this discovery that i and other officials in bank now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill . the banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years , the money will be transfered into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund . the request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and i can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner , it is also against our the banking law , guideline and ethics of banks here in my country . we have agreed that 20 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner , in respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 70 % would be for me and my colleagues . there after i and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated . therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as requested to provide the following : your full name and address , your direct telephone and fax number and your bank information . all the requested information will enable me perfect all the necessary things in your favour for smooth transfer of the fund into you account as you will provide . if you are interested , please contact me via my email address : mamadou _ salif @ mixmail . com and also call me on my telephone for more details : 00221 699 . 9741 . upon your response , i shall provide you with more details on how we shall proceed with the claims . i expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us without any risk involved . awaiting your urgent reply . thanks & regards . dr . salif mamadou .

' s ratings on rating watch negative by fitch . the rating of the marlin ii notes is supported by an overfund account ( pre - funded interest ) and equity commitment from enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock . the overfund account is invested in enron debt securities ( rated ' bbb + ' , rating watch negative ) , with payments used to service interest to noteholders . payment of principal ultimately relies on enron ' s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities . fitch currently rates enron ' s preferred securities ' bbb - ' , rating watch negative . in addition , the transaction also benefits from rights under a $ 125 million loan to azurix europe limited , rated ` bbb + ' by fitch . similarly , the rating of the osprey i notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments . the mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust . the assets in the share trust supporting interest payments include enron unsecured obligations ( the overfund account ) as well as quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible preferred stock . while various sources of repayment exist , such as sale or liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering , in each case primary credit support is derived from the enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee the 120 - day prior to the maturity date , which is one of the note trigger events . in the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes , enron is required to deliver additional shares . if enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation , subject to certain standstill periods , then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of enron , representing a general unsecured claim . additional note trigger events include a downgrade of enron ' s senior unsecured debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in enron ' s closing stock price over three consecutive trading days , as well as customary events of default under the notes . it is important to note that enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt . fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction with the ratings of enron , corp . and will update investors as appropriate . enron ' s debt falls as company draws down on bank loans 10 / 26 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early friday following the houston energy giant ' s decision thursday to draw down about $ 3 billion on its bank loan facilities . late thursday , enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community . specifically , the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $ 1 billion . enron ' s 6 . 4 % bonds which come due in july 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar , down from around 82 cents on thursday . trading activity in investment - grade bank debt like that of enron ' s isn ' t as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment - grade ratings . but fixed - income sources noted some offers friday for enron ' s bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar , still well - above distressed levels . they add that banks may want to try to sell enron ' s bank debt , which is now funded following the drawdown , but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago . that was well before enron ran into its current market turmoil . last week , the company reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the company has said that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with andrew s . fastow , its former chief financial officer who was replaced on wednesday . moody ' s investors service rates enron ' s senior unsecured debt at baal , though it ' s on review for a possible downgrade . fitch inc . and standard & poor ' s both rate the debt triple - b - plus . fitch also has enron ' s debt on review for a possible downgrade , while s joe . niedzielski @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron sues microsoft over failed broadband services deal by michael rieke of dow jones newswires 10 / 26 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 713 - 547 - 9207 ; michael . rieke @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business enron unit takes heat power group says energy firm failed bond requirements jeffrey krasner , globe staff 10 / 26 / 2001 the boston globe third c . 1 ( copyright 2001 ) the retail sales subsidiary of houston energy giant enron corp . faced expulsion last week from the new england group representing power generators , marketers and distributors . the sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills . iso new england , which operates the power grid throughout the six new england states , urged nepool , the power industry group , to " initiate termination proceedings " for enron energy services inc . , according to a letter obtained by the globe . an enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied nepool ' s requirements , and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights , including the failure of iso new england to warn enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels . " it was an administrative snafu , " said peggy mahoney , a spokeswoman for enron . " it ' s fixed . it ' s no big deal . we didn ' t get the paperwork in [ on time ] because it got sent to the wrong desk . it was taken care of on friday . " according to the letter , a nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months . " having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently , " said ellen foley , an iso new england spokeswoman . in the letter , iso ' s chief financial officer , edward mckenna , said his organization " has been in contact with enron energy services through multiple telephone communications , and to date the financial assurance has not been cured . " but mahoney said enron never received written notification of its previous " financial assurance " defaults , which were corrected almost immediately . therefore , she said , the company was unaware that the current default was the third , which begins the expulsion proceeding . in addition , she said , the current default notice was sent to the wrong person , creating the delay that resulted in the letter . " we ' re working with iso new england to figure that out , " she said . the recommended termination is an embarrassment to enron because the firm ' s director of state government affairs , daniel w . allegretti , is the chairman of nepool ' s participant committee , which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization . " this is not that unusual within the pool , " said allegretti . " i frequently receive notices of technical defaults . " as far as posting the new bond to correct the situation , he said , " we were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork . " the incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for enron . the parent in houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm ' s chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . the securities and exchange commission is probing those transactions , the company said monday . enron placed fastow on leave tuesday and installed a new cfo . enron ' s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company ' s financial strength . the company reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by fastow , according to the wall street journal . enron lost $ 618 million in the third quarter . yesterday , enron ' s shares closed at $ 16 . 35 , down 6 cents , on volume of 39 . 1 million shares . jeffrey krasner can be reached by e - mail at krasner @ globe . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . front page - companies oct 26 , 2001 by julie earle and sheila mcnulty enron has put up a page on its website of " frequently asked questions " in response to a barrage of analysts ' enquiries following last week ' s controversial results announcement . unfortunately , the us energy group ' s critics have not been satisfied with the answers . nor has wednesday ' s decision to replace andrew fastow , its chief financial officer , quelled all investors ' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs . however , analysts are pleased that kenneth lay , chief executive officer , is distancing the group from mr fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle " partnerships " . " it is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move , " says ronald barone of ubs warburg . " it ' s not the end of it . " the shares , which have tumbled since last week ' s results , ended a shade lower yesterday , off 0 . 37 per cent at dollars 16 . 35 . but analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52 - week high of dollars 84 . 87 until the group improves its transparency . one of the frequently asked questions following enron ' s results announcement on october 16 concerned " a dollars 1 . 2 bn ( pounds 840 m ) reduction in shareholders ' equity " . the dollars 1 . 2 bn was not explained in the news release on the results , but mentioned in passing by mr lay in a follow - up conference call . many analysts confused it with a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge in the earnings report . it has since been called a " loss " and a " write - off " and enron ' s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language . enron ' s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders ' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which ljm , a private equity fund formed by mr fastow , was an investor . when the decision was made to terminate these vehicles , enron " recorded a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables . these adjustments were the result of enron ' s termination of obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods " . the confusion over the dollars 1 . 2 bn has further undermined the credibility of enron , which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group ' s debt ratio , which might hurt its debt rating . mr lay held an analysts ' meeting to counter charges that enron was not transparent . but this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts . " i find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions , " said goldman sachs ' david fleischer . other analysts are also concerned about potential further write - offs . salomon smith barney ' s raymond niles points to enron ' s investments in its dabhol indian power plant , its south american investments , and its remaining telecoms assets . most importantly , he says , they may include several of enron ' s other off - balance - sheet vehicles . " frankly , we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them , " mr niles says . other us energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival . el paso said it was facing " a lot of questions on its accounting practices " . additional reporting by julie earle enron in turmoil : www . ft . com / enron copyright : the financial times limited enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 14 : 26 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) ( adds egan - jones lowering credit rating in 12 th paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond rating wouldn ' t be lowered and tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets . enron ' s stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after investors questioned the company ' s transactions with affiliated companies run by its former chief financial officer . the stock fell 45 cents to $ 15 . 90 in early afternoon trading today . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion of fixed income assets at fifth third bancorp . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself .

2	Subject: national bank of canada ( nbc ) louise and bill , as you are aware , nbc has sent us notification of an event of default under the isda due to our failure to post collateral ( in the form of an lc ) . to date , nbc has resisted all of our commercial solutions to this issue . at the close of business today , our cure period for the event of default will expire , and nbc will be able to draw on the $ 1 . 4 mm lc posted and terminate the contract . today we have seen a bit of movement in their position . they are now willing to accept cash as collateral if enron will agree to reduce its collateral threshold to some agreed upon amount . bill bonnell , their credit manager , has suggested $ 4 mm as the appropriate level . this would entail enron posting $ 3 mm in addition to the $ 500 k collateral call for a total of $ 3 . 5 mm . i believe we could more than likely negotiate the threshold to $ 5 mm if we are willing to post the cash . a $ 5 mm level would require an additional posting of $ 2 mm which is what we originally forecasted to try to buy down the position exposure . as we must have a resolution today to forestall further action on the part of nbc , please advise as to management ' s willingness to use cash for the purpose of preventing termination of this contract . thanks , tanya

2	Subject: daniel kargbo . fork ! fork , from ; mr . david kargbou and family , johannesburg , south africa . my dear , good day . this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you . but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you , and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires . i got your contact information from your country ' s information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes . my name is mr . david kargbou , the second son of mr . smith thabo kargbou , of beitbridge zimbabwe . at the height of the present political crises in our country , in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president , mr . robert g . mugabe , in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country , my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13 th of february , 2002 , in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house . my father , during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries . he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr . robert mugabe and his followers , which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts . that not being enough , the president and his followers after winning the la st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes [ that included my fathers assets and accounts ] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers , along with the assets of these white farmers themselves , that are being presently confiscated . i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa , where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood . during my fathers life on earth , he had deposited the sum of seven million and four hundred thousand united states dollars [ $ 7 . 400 . 000 . 00 ] in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers , awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination , which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day . in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father , and with the present clamp down , killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country , i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally , to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc ked by the present mugabe ' s regime . my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit . now this is what i actually want you to do for me ; 1 . i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose , with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office . 2 . to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years . please , i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now , and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with . and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request , i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help . thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request . best regards , mr . david kargbou and family . http : / / xent . com / mailman / listinfo / fork

2	Subject: california update 7 / 31 / 01 there is a serious effort currently underway in california to unseat senator burton ( d - san francisco ) , president pro tem . even though the chances of this happening are relatively low , john bryson , ceo of socal , with the support of the governor , are making huge efforts to oust burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - richard alarcon ( d - san fernando valley ) , majority whip or sheila kuehl ( d - los angeles ) . alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position . however , at minimum , bryson , governor davis and / or other senators hope that burton will rethink his position on the mou and a socal bailout . additionally , behind the scenes , things are looking very grim for california due the implications of direct access . the biggest opponent of direct access comes from the governor ' s office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance .

2	Subject: how do officialized books make it to credit ? in the past few months much focus has been put on understanding var and how it is calculated ( through risktrac ) . however , everyone should note that the credit department also receives our information . market risk and credit risk are inherently different , with different requirements . this memo serves as a reminder of what some of the key differences are , how the credit system uses risktrac differently from market risk , how this affects us , what some key problems are in the credit system caused by our data , and changes to be made by risk management groups . differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this , but many of your ba ' s don ' t . when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit . flat books must be officialized market risk is keyed off positions and curves . when we make money , market risk is reduced . credit risk is keyed off positions with customers . when we make money , credit risk is increased , as people owe us more money . how the credit system uses risktrac differently from market risk market risk picks up all officialized books . if a book is not officialized it does not pick the book up . credit picks up all officalized books . if a book is not officialized , it picks up the previous day ' s position . therefore , if positions in book a are moved to book b , and a is no longer officialized , credit picks up the previous day ' s position for book a . as a result , if a book is no longer used , please officialize it the first day it is no longer used , so credit will pick up 0 on a go forward basis . market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names . credit needs correct counterparty codes and names . in recent months , the counterparty information has deteriorated . enron official counterparty names need to be used so they flow properly to credit . what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data as referenced above : correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info . as a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first day it has 0 positions . if you have specific questions about credit , please call debbie brackett , at x 35856 .

2	Subject: kern river to do another open season lorna , sources close to kern river confirmed with me just yesterday that the original expansion ( 124 , 500 mmbtu / d ) is being contracted principally by one party , pg & e national energy group , for their la paloma power project outside of bakersfield , california . i ' m assuming that additional support for a 2 nd krgt expansion will come from other developers interested in securing gas supply . it ' s important to remember the economics here - - - kern river ' s pipeline originates in wyoming ( rockies gas ) and delivers directly into southern california . their gas generally clears the market at the southern california border index . consequently , there is no stacking of rates as would be the case if tw or epng attempted to deliver their gas through mojave to the same markets . i ' ve attached the recent press release regarding the la paloma project for your information . . . pg & e corporation unit begins construction of california ' s largest  + greenfield  , merchant power plant la paloma facility will fill a critical need for new electricity supplies in california san francisco  ) welcoming the opportunity to provide competitive electricity to meet the growing electricity needs of california , pg & e corporation ( nyse : pcg ) announced today that its national energy group has begun construction on the la paloma generating plant . la paloma is a 1 , 048 - megawatt , natural gas - fueled combined - cycle facility . the plant is expected to begin operating in the summer of 2001 . pg & e national energy group president & ceo tom boren said , " the construction of the la paloma facility is an important step in meeting the growing demand for electricity in the state . we welcome the opportunity to further the growth of customer choice in california ' s evolving competitive power market . " the california independent system operator ( iso ) , a non - profit public benefit corporation responsible for maintaining transmission reliability and ensuring adequate electricity supplies , hailed la paloma as a welcome addition . " as north america  , s only regional transmission operator relying on competitive market forces to maintain the critical balance between electricity supply and demand for california  , s 27 million electric customers , the california iso is very pleased that pg & e  , s national energy group has stepped forward with the la paloma facility to fill an essential consumer need , " said cal iso president & ceo terry winter . " this investment shows that the market is responding to the growing demand for electricity . " " as a highly efficient plant from both an energy and environmental standpoint , california consumers will benefit , " added pg & e corp . ' s boren . " the la paloma generating plant provides highly competitive costs with a minimum of energy consumption and environmental impacts . " the la paloma plant site is approximately 40 miles west of bakersfield , calif . in western kern county on an industrial site previously used for oil production . when completed , it will be the state  , s largest facility designed from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant . a merchant plant sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitive bulk power market . those wholesale customers , which include traditional utilities , municipal utility districts , retail energy services companies , wholesale power marketers , and electric cooperatives , in turn arrange to have the electricity delivered to retail consumers . the la paloma development team has selected abb alstom power inc . as the turnkey contractor for the project . abb alstom power is responsible for the design and engineering work , the procurement of equipment and management of sub - contractors , and the actual construction of the facility . the la paloma generating project received its california energy commission approval in october 1999 , and the financing package for the project is being completed now . " the rigorous permitting process really laid the ground for an outstanding construction program , " said roger garratt , project development manager for pg & e corporation  , s generating unit . " we look forward to making a major contribution to the kern county economy in a manner that is completely compatible with the area ' s sensitive ecosystem . " garratt noted the project ' s plan to permanently set aside conservation land as part of its environmental mitigation program . market intelligence - enron transportation services from : lorna brennan on 11 / 29 / 2000 09 : 49 am to : courtney barker / et & s / enron @ enron , john goodpasture / ots / enron @ enron , michael ratner / ots / enron @ enron , sebastian corbacho / et & s / enron @ enron , yuan tian / et & s / enron @ enron , mike mcgowan / et & s / enron @ enron , rockey storie / et & s / enron @ enron , kent miller / et & s / enron @ enron , john dushinske / et & s / enron @ enron , dave neubauer / et & s / enron @ enron , bill fowler / et & s / enron @ enron , steven harris / et & s / enron @ enron , jeffery fawcett / et & s / enron @ enron , lorraine lindberg / et & s / enron @ enron , kevin hyatt / et & s / enron @ enron , christine stokes / et & s / enron @ enron , tk lohman / et & s / enron @ enron , michelle lokay / et & s / enron @ enron , lindy donoho / et & s / enron @ enron , lee huber / et & s / enron @ enron , susan scott / et & s / enron @ enron cc : subject : kern river to do another open season open season expected for kern river capacity after the recent successful completion of an open season on an added 124 , 5000 dth / d of firm transportation capacity into california along its 922 - mile interstate pipeline , williams ' subsidiary kern river gas transmission will announce another open season this week , perhaps as early as today for additional new capacity on the pipeline carrying rocky mountain supplies from southwest wyoming , a salt lake city - based kern river spokesperson said tuesday . although the spokesperson indicated the current 700 mmcf / d - capacity pipeline is running full these days , kern river has no plans to re - open its previous proposals to build transmission laterals within california , heading north and south into major industrial areas of the state . the growing supplies , which are expected to come into the state to fuel the accelerating demand for new natural gas - fired electric generation plants , will be fulfilled by adding compression and looping , the spokesperson said . kern river is planning on bringing " a lot more volumes " into california in the years ahead , said the spokesperson , noting that the recent capacity expansion will be made possible by an $ 80 million project to add three new compressor stations , additional compression at an existing wyoming station , restage a compressor in utah and upgrade two meter stations . the new open season is expected to run for two months through the end of january for marketers , merchant generators , large industrial plants and utilities along the pipeline route in utah , nevada and california , all of which have been experiencing tremendous energy load growth . the bulk of the interest is still expected to come from california , the spokesperson said .

2	Subject: forward obligations report issues bill - following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report . as i understand , dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager , which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run ( forward obs included ) , but in the meantime these are the problems we ' ve seen . thanks so much for your help on this ! 1 . report not reading two identical strips - when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours , same volume , same price and same counterparty ( using the same deal number ) , the report only reads one strip . for example , on 8 / 6 / 01 , deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 7 - 12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 13 - 22 . the report read all 50 mw he 7 - 12 , but only 25 mw he 13 - 22 . i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw . another example , on 8 / 4 / 01 , deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 21 - 22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each . again , the report read only one of these , and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours . due to the nature of real time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price . so i ' m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms . please let me know if this is feasible . 2 . report not reading sales at the bc border - this is a new one that cropped up this morning . we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar , wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there . for some reason , although all three deals ( 724366 / 724368 / 724367 ) appear in deal entry and scheduling , the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report . after looking into this , i ' ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report . i ' m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border , although i don ' t recall seeing this problem before . again , please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed . i look forward to our next conference call . . . . thanks , kate symes real time trading support 503 - 464 - 3939

" there is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse , collusion and affiliate self dealing of out - of - state gas suppliers and merchants , " edison told the cpuc . the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section 5 complaint with ferc regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of " certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out - of - state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity . " it notes the complaint " conservatively estimates that the anti - competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged california gas and electricity users by $ 100 million annually since the beginning of 1998 . " jeff dasovich from the enron california office will attend the ferc meeting .

2	Subject: re : var vince thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own discussion yesterday : i want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and administration of var . we need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions , for example , are easily made , supported and reviewed . it became clear after last friday ' s events , that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle var here , particularly at " pressure points " . i am putting together the scope of a " general overhaul " of the var process , including method and administration , to which i hope we would all buy in , so be assured of our co - operation . dp - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kaminski , vince sent : wednesday , april 11 , 2001 2 : 49 pm to : port , david cc : lavorato , john ; kaminski , vince ; tamarchenko , tanya subject : var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince

2	Subject: neon retreat ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time ! i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute . on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about . i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer . the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past . the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide . email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! ) have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy ! bobby

2	Subject: a cry for help dear friend , i am mrs . sese - seko widow of late president mobutu sese - seko of zaire ? now known as democratic republic of congo ( drc ) . i am moved to write you this letter , this was in confidence considering my and situation . i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons george kongolo and basher out of democratic republic of congo ( drc ) to abidjan , cote d ' ivoire where my family and i settled , while we later moved to settled in morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease . however due to this situation we decided to changed most of my husband ' s billions of dollars deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of ( dr ) mr laurent kabila has made arrangement with the swiss government and other european countries to freeze all my late husband ' s treasures deposited in some european countries . hence my children and i decided laying low in africa to study the situation till when things gets better , like now that president kabila is dead and the son taking over ( joseph kabila ) . one of my late husband ' s chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the french government , and as such i had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated . i have deposited the sum eighteen million united state dollars ( us $ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 . ) with a security company , for safekeeping . the funds are security coded to prevent them from knowing the content . what i want you to do is to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our behalf . acknowledge this message , so that i can introduce you to my son ( kongolo ) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds . i want you to assist in investing this money , but i will not want my identity revealed . i will also want to buy properties and stock in multi - national companies and to engage in other safe and non - speculative investments . may i at this point emphasise the high level of confidentiality , which this business demands , and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence , which i repose in you . in conclusion , if you want to assist us , my son shall put you in the picture of the business , tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss other modalities including remunerationfor your services . for this reason kindly furnish us your contact information , that is your personal telephone and fax number for confidential purpose . best regards , mrs m . sese seko

2	Subject: lm 6000 swap louise , a couple of weeks ago we bought an option on four more lm 6000 ' s for a jano 2 delivery . the intent was to sell our 4 julyol machines and recognize approximately $ 5 mm for this " time swap " . we believe that we are in a position to execute this swap ( delta power is at the table ) , but during the past two weeks we have received very strong tolling bids ( merrill lynch , duke , constellation ) for the lv project that imply a $ 20 mm value to the project but require a commercial operation date of sepo 2 . cod of sepo 2 requires early turbine delivery . we are therefore leaning towards canceling the turbine sale / repurchase in order to go for the bigger prize . it will require finalizing development , epc contract , tolling agreement , finance plan and internal approvals by may 1 . i am recommending that we go for it . if we are not able to pull it off , i am confident that the high bids for these machines will still be there . chris

2	Subject: assist your sister with her suffering cease minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack " indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority .

2	Subject: organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co -
