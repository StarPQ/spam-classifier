" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

2	Subject: deal confirmation changes good afternoon ron , we just had a meeting with bill williams , head of real - time trading in portland , to discuss some problems we are having with the real - time deals flowing to the deal confirmation system . currently , the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real - time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups . one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real - time traders use deal entry to make all the changes . this solution will not work . if the real - time guys start changing the deals in deal entry , the original negotiated deal will be lost . also , and more importantly , the time to make all the changes for the real - time adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing . thanks , david poston it manager , portland

( trb , 40 . 00 , pe 24 ) are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies . cdyv represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as their pe is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings figures . the industry average pe is 20 , indicating that a share price of 5 . 00 for cdyv would be a very conservative valuation . it is only a matter of time before detailed information is released out into the investment community . by receiving this email , you are among the first public investors to know about cdyv . get in now before the crowds take it to the moon . please read - the information and opinions in this featured profile are based on sources believed to be reliable but no representation is made to its accuracy or completeness . past performance is not an indicator of future results . this report is a paid profile for information purposes only and should not be used as the basis for any investment decision . this newsletter has been compensated ten thousand dollars for the preparation of this profile and for continuing cover age of the featured company . newsletter publishers are not investment advisors and this profile is not to be considered investment advice . this information is neither a solicitation to buy nor an offer to sell securities . information herein contains future - looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties . there are no shares presently held and no participation will occur in the trading of shares in any profiled company .

2	Subject: interesting media article from dow jones on price controls interesting media article ( see below ) from dow jones on price controls - ray niles ( 212 - 816 - 2807 ) my comments : this is a good article explaining the complex power market in california . basically , the problem in california is insufficient deregulation . the problems are worsened by the particular mixture of controls and market forces which combine to create imbalances . specifically , while retail prices are capped , wholesale prices are market - determined except that there are restrictions against long - term hedging . this is a recipe for high and volatile short - term power prices , which we have seen . our view is unchanged that price controls set at a meaningfully low level will cause blackouts by creating an imbalance between supply and demand . this is elementary economics . price controls reduce supply ( electrons flow elsewhere seeking higher prices and power plants don ' t get built ) while demand remains artificially high ( customers respond to the low , controlled prices by maintaining consumption at high levels ) . price caps are the issue now facing the industry . we think meaningfully low caps will not be instituted . if they are , they contain a " self - repeal " mechanism - - i . e . , blackouts . in our view , the only way to bring supply and demand into equilibrium is through market - determined prices coupled with new investment in power plants , electric transmission lines , gas pipelines , etc . > raymond c . niles power / natural gas research salomon smith barney ( 212 ) 816 - 2807 ray . niles @ ssmb . com s - interesting media article 5 - 30 - 01 . doc

2	Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01 executive summary ? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day " opt - out " clause in all long - term power contracts . ? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table : puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value ? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing utility . ? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some details : of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this summer some of the " long term contracts " are really only for three months none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot market ? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly announce a 10 % rate hike . ? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal . pg & e transmissions deal one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power contracts being negotiated have a one - day " opt - out " clause they can exercise unilaterally if a " comprehensive solution " has not been reached by the state and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now . pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the " electricity buyer of last resort . " current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings . but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then pg & e will be left holding the bag . thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is demanding a " comprehensive solution " that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of " get out of jail free " card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must " positively approve " any grid purchase by the state of california . the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit . " we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they think , " according to the leader of one main consumer groups . " we are going to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . " negotiators for davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative . remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution . on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads . ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 % above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done , anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase . ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood . ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will " make them whole " in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving . thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior political official told our source " just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they come up with something even more outrageous . " pg and some of these " long - term contracts " are actually only good for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market . davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires . that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour . ferc the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but they may be wrong . " the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what anyone says , " according to source close to the president . there are three possibilities : 1 ) ferc could " pocket veto " it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system . one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not be around long enough to have his say . " hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the ferc chairman position , " says one washington official . two other appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and one of them " could easily become chairman .

( news / quote ) worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in enron ' s weakened energy - trading business as the companies ' negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger , executives close to the talks said . the renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half , they said , to roughly $ 4 billion . dynegy , they said , was also prepared to invest at least an additional $ 250 million in enron , on top of the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from dynegy ' s biggest investor , chevrontexaco , included in the initial deal announced nov . 9 . but dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets , and the companies were trying to identify and value enough enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors , the executives said . before a series of financial disclosures sent enron ' s stock into collapse and the company into the arms of dynegy , its houston rival , enron ' s natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined . they also accounted for the majority of enron ' s profits by far . but traders and wall street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of enron ' s financial straits . many traders have curtailed dealings with enron , and the executives close to the talks said dynegy officials scouring enron ' s books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating . the executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for dynegy ' s acquisition of enron would lower the price to about 0 . 13 dynegy share for each share of enron , cutting by half the value of the deal announced nov . 9 , when dynegy offered 0 . 2685 share . if a deal is struck at 0 . 13 dynegy share , at yesterday ' s closing prices , dynegy would be paying about $ 5 . 32 an enron share , a 29 . 4 percent premium over enron ' s diminished stock price . the premium was 20 . 6 percent over enron ' s closing price on the day that the deal was announced . both companies are seeking promises from enron ' s bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes . and they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit dynegy ' s ability to back out of the combination . the two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of $ 500 million from j . p . morgan chase ( news / quote ) and citigroup ( news / quote ) that would provide enron with desperately needed new cash . but there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors ' fears or reassure energy traders , leading dynegy to seek an additional $ 500 million in cash for enron . late yesterday , the two companies were hung up over whether enron , which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans , has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money , according to executives close to the talks . a number of enron assets were being examined , including some that have already been used to obtain other loans , the executives said . the assets include : transwestern pipeline , a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas - producing basins of texas and the southwest with california ; enron ' s stake in other gas - pipeline assets ; its 9 . 8 percent stake , worth about $ 400 million , in eog resources ( news / quote ) , a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company ; and its indirect stake in hanover compressor , which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines . yesterday , investors anxiously awaited a report by moody ' s investors service , which like other major credit - rating firms , currently ranks enron ' s debt at the lowest investment - grade level . if enron were to lose its investment - grade status , it could be forced to repay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , while other traders would probably further curtail business . but by late yesterday , moody ' s ( news / quote ) decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon , the executives said . a moody ' s spokesman declined comment . executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and the energy - trading markets that enron ' s trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset . but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost , and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns . " i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result , " said andre meade , head of united states utilities research for commerzbank securities in new york . " i don ' t think anyone can estimate the earning power of enron over the next three to four quarters , and i ' m not sure enron has a good estimate . " mr . meade said he did not believe that dynegy ' s earlier estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to its earnings was " reliable today , given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated . " by mr . meade ' s calculations , if enron ' s trading volumes were to fall 50 percent next year - even if normal volume growth levels returned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock . karen denne , an enron spokeswoman , said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it , but both stabilized yesterday . she declined to elaborate or quantify the decline . she also said that enron ' s trading operation remained profitable , though she could not quantify it , and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen . " we ' re moving forward with the merger , " she said . dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday . shares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement . they closed at $ 4 . 11 , up 2 . 5 percent , or 10 cents . shares of dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up 4 . 2 percent , or $ 1 . 64 . though yesterday ' s gains halted a four - day slide in enron shares , the stock is down 95 percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly $ 600 million . now , difficulties within enron ' s trading operation are exacerbating the company ' s overall liquidity problems in three ways , according to some analysts and rival energy - trading executives . first , other traders are requiring enron to put up greater margin on its trades . on top of that , in some cases enron ' s traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies . this credit premium in some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for every million british thermal units of gas enron buys , these people say . additionally , many traders , like the mirant corporation ( news / quote ) , have either scaled back or stopped doing business with enron , hurting its trading revenue . mr . meade of commerzbank said " end - use customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of enron ' s credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to enron .

2	Subject: small cap stox can sizzle the contact center industry few people today know exactly what a contact center does . its predecessor , the call center , brings to mind large telemarketing operations with people calling your house during dinner time . but the fact is that the contact center is much more than that . we see 800 numbers everywhere - the back of our credit cards , the fast food drive - thru window , i ' ll bet even your bottle of water has a phone number to call with questions . the fact is that wherever there is an 800 number , there is a person answering the call . not just a person , but millions of people in north america alone , across a staggering 76 , 000 + contact centers . it used to be the contact center only handled inbound customer service calls and outbound sales calls . that was before the proliferation of the internet - now these same customer service reps are waiting for our phone calls , our faxes , our emails and our web chats . we can call from our offices , home phones , cell phones - even from our computers - americans generate hundreds of millions of transactions each year for contact centers and the industry has grown by leaps and bounds . so aggressive is the growth that today , we are as likely to get someone in california to answer our call as we are to get someone in india . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * contact centers in north america handle millions of transactions each year . for each type of transaction there is a technology that supports it . automatic call distributors for inbound calls , interactive voice response systems ( the dreaded " press 1 " ) for self service , email and web servers . in the midst of all of this disparate technology , contact centers began to lose track of a very important piece of their puzzle : information . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the contact center industry is one of the most data intensive industries . think about it - even if you order a pair of shoes , the contact center has your name , phone number , mailing address , billing address , credit card information , etc . the contact center also has information on each and every one of their employees and all of their activity . every call they received , how long they talked , how long they placed people on hold , how many calls were transferred . until now , no single piece of technology can track information on all people regarding all activities , for one simple reason . the activities are all generated and tracked by different technologies . human science systems , inc . ( hmns ) company overview : human science systems , inc . ( pink sheets : hmns ) is a contact center software development firm . its flagship product , central authorityt serves one main purpose : to be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center . central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center , regardless of the technology where the data originated . central authorityt is a contact center resource management ( ccrmt ) product . ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human , physical and technical resources within the contact center . contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellas : employees , technology , capacity , and clients . it may be hard to believe , but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories , and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a real - time basis . " * why hmns should be on your radar : 1 . datamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume of 76 , 000 contact centers in 2001 and that by the end of 2006 that number will exceed 79 , 600 contact centers . 2 . contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome , more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry . 3 . today ' s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions , but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources . 4 . contact centers are looking to replace manual or semi - automated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome , but highly inaccurate and complex . 5 . hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back over 15 years and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers . top tier contact centers generate over $ 100 million per year within the north american market . 6 . hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property . 7 . a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a 5 % market share level in five years would be plausible . with a mere 5 % market share , a 40 % sales margin ( fully taxed ) would imply $ 10 million of net income in 2010 . in that event , the report noted that on the present 17 . 6 million shares , earnings would exceed $ 0 . 50 per share . the report concluded that " the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company ' s product has a good chance of hitting it ! " 8 . the company is negotiating distributorships through software distributors that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue from the center industry . 9 . hmns will generate revenue not only from software sales , but from application service provider ( asp ) services ( from customers that " subscribe " to the technology and access it by the internet ) , from installation ( billable at 12 % of the total software sale ) , and recurring maintenance ( recurring annual revenue billable at 18 % of the value of the software ) . 10 . datamonitor recently estimated the global market for call center component technologies at $ 4 . 1 billion , and predicts an increase to $ 5 . 5 billion by 2007 , growing at a 6 . 0 % compounded annual growth rate . 11 . gartner also reports positive and stable growth for software distributors , stating that end user spending was to exceed $ 76 . 1 billion by the end of 2005 . 12 . last year alone , u . s . banks were forecasted to spend $ 1 . 9 billion on contact center technology . * management and other comments : lou mandic , hmns ceo & president : " this technology was born out of years worth of research . we are well engrained in this industry and are keenly aware of its needs . we are without a doubt delivering the most mission critical software in the industry today . we anticipate rapid growth , which is not uncommon in our industry . by its fourth year of operation , blue pumpkin - a company that provides only a portion of what central authority offers - had already captured a 7 % market share . a far lesser market share will have our company earning better than $ 10 million annually . " company philosophy : " if you can measure it you can manage it . " * things to consider : according to empire research , the company has a competitively superior product , a large enough market to support sustained rapid growth , and a proprietary market position that can provide handsome profit returns . hmns is in the process of establishing distributorships with companies that annually sell billions of dollars worth of software to contact centers . hmns has buy - out appeal and has already been approached by far larger players that may later be interested in acquiring the company and / or its intellectual property . how the technology works central authorityt is a software product that fills the role of a central repository of data . through meta data tables , the software is able to " read " all other technologies , and act as a central point of contact for the enterprise . the software also collects data inherently ( this is data entered directly into central authorityt , not collected from other systems ) on employees , recruiting sources and performance , enabling the organization to better manage its human resource processes and reducing its turnover , which can be as high as 200 % in the contact center industry . * conclusion : the problem with inter - departmental communications is not exclusive to the contact center industry . it is a problem for corporate america as a whole . companies like human science systems are delivering the next mission critical piece of software - one that can normalize all data , across all technologies , and act as a single , central point of contact for the enterprise .

2	Subject: summary - judge ' s recommendation re retroactive refunds commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference , the chief judge , in his down home manner , did not miss the opportunity to say that " you can take a horse to water but you can ' t make him drink . " below is a cliff notes version of the judge ' s report and recommendation issued at 4 : 49 pm today . attached is the complete work . the judge opined that very large refunds would be due - " while the amount of such refunds is not $ 8 . 9 billion as claimed by the state of california , they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars , probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum . ? at the same time , while there are vast sums due for overcharges , there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso , the investor owned utilities , and the state of california . can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller ? the chief judge thinks not . " another notable quote : " ? it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated . " the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5 , which was summarily rejected by the state of california , and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected . refund effective date - refund effective date of october 2 , 2000 , for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px . the chief judge ' s recommendations do not go beyond that date . " spot market " sales are " sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery . " evidentiary hearing - " the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact . the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes . thus , the chief judge recommends that a trial - type , evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below . because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60 - day fast track schedule . it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding . however , such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot markets in an after - the - fact refund calculation . in any event , sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period . " methodology - the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june 19 th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october 2 , 2000 through may 28 , 2001 . heat rate - the actual heat rates , rather than hypothetical heat rates ( associated with recreating the must - bid requirement of the june 19 th order ) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit . gas cost - the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price . " in the event that the marginal unit is located in npl 5 ( north of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for pg & e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . if the marginal unit is located in spl 5 ( south of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . the daily spot gas prices should be for the " midpoint " as published in financial times energy ' s " gas daily " publication for the aforementioned delivery points . the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published ( weekends and holidays ) . " o & m adder - an adder of $ 6 / mwh for o & m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price . emissions costs - demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation . credit adder - the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january 5 , 2001 when pg & e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy . ancillary services - consistent with the june 19 th order , ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real - time imbalance energy market . adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june 19 th order . maximum price for non - emergency hours - somewhat unclear . the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds , the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 % non - emergency requirement of the june 19 th order . to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price , every hour should be recalculated . offsets - " recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period . amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated . any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period . " interest - interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller .

' s stock and bond prices took another beating after the energy company ' s release late monday of its much - anticipated third - quarter financial filing with the securities and exchange commission , which revealed potentially major new cash - flow and earnings headaches . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were at $ 6 . 991 , down $ 2 . 07 , or 23 % . enron once again topped the big board ' s most - active list with 89 . 9 million shares traded , more than twice the volume of the next most active stock . enron bond prices fell into the range of between 70 cents and 80 cents on the dollar , according to market observers . following the announcement earlier this month of dynegy inc . ' s plan to purchase enron for around $ 10 billion in stock , bond prices had firmed to above 80 cents on the dollar . yesterday , a dynegy spokesman wouldn ' t comment on the status of the pending acquisition , other than to say his company was reviewing enron ' s third - quarter financial report , filed with the sec , as part of continuing " due diligence . " under the proposed acquisition , dynegy would exchange 0 . 2685 of its shares for each enron share . based on dynegy ' s 4 p . m . price yesterday on the big board of $ 41 . 70 a share , off $ 1 . 90 , the deal values enron shares at about $ 11 . 20 - - well above the current market price . monday ' s third - quarter financial report from enron , which supplemented and revised enron ' s earnings announcement last month , reinforced fears that the energy - trading company is in a " precarious financial position and will be for awhile , " said andre meade , head of u . s . utility research at commerzbank securities . as reported in the wall street journal , enron ' s sec filing monday said that because of the company ' s deteriorated credit standing , it might have to repay a $ 690 million note by this coming monday . the filing also said enron might be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax charge to earnings in the current quarter , ending dec . 31 , due to a drop in value of some of its assets . houston - based enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past month , since announcing big asset and shareholder - equity reductions in the third quarter . much of the turmoil has been caused by the company ' s dealings with partnerships headed by former enron officers , including its former chief financial officer . those dealings are the subject of a formal sec investigation . enron ' s financial woes have also led to a " reduced level of transaction activity " with the company by trading partners , the sec filing said . how well , or poorly , enron ' s energy - trading volume holds up is " the million - dollar question , " said simmons & co . analyst jeff dietert . enron ' s trading operation has been the company ' s main profit engine and the major attraction for dynegy in the acquisition deal . yesterday , other major energy - trading companies said they were still doing business with enron but were closely monitoring the firm ' s condition . standard & poor ' s ratings group also reaffirmed enron ' s credit ratings even though it said monday ' s sec filings " raise liquidity issues " for the company . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron , vdeg may bid to export bulgarian electricity , paper says 2001 - 11 - 21 03 : 40 ( new york ) sofia , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , seeks to export electricity from bulgaria to italy , dnevnik daily reported , citing unidentified sources from the state energy agency . enron , as well as two german companies , including vdeg , will be invited to bid at a tender for the national electricity company to select energy trading partners , the paper said . enron is being bought by rival dynegy inc . for about $ 20 billion . currently nec ead is the sole exporter of electricity from bulgaria , which provides energy to most of its neighbors , including serbia , macedonia , montenegro , greece , kosovo , albania , and turkey . last year the country exported electricity worth $ 117 million to turkey alone . opening the energy market to competition is part of the requirements for bulgaria to join the european union . the international monetary fund , which is expected to provide $ 150 million to bulgaria over the next year , also insisted on reorganization of the energy industry . raymond james analyst cartwright comments on enron disclosure 2001 - 11 - 21 07 : 45 ( new york ) new york , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - jon kyle cartwright , a senior vice president and senior energy analyst at raymond james & associates inc . in st . petersburg , florida comments on the enron corp . ' s disclosure that it may have to repay a $ 690 million note next week following the downgrade of its credit ratings to the lowest investment - grade level . the houston - based energy trader made the disclosure in a filing with the securities and exchange commission known as a ` ` 10 q ' ' on monday . ` ` i have to believe that dynegy knew about this , maybe not when the deal was signed , but certainly before the 10 q was published . there was wiggle room in the deal for both write downs , which effectively includes both the note and the potential write down for whitewing . ' ' ` ` there still appears to be enough liquidity to handle the write offs and the $ 690 million limited partnership note . ' ' ` ` over the short - run , the rest of this week , it is going to be difficult for anyone to trade with enron , because they should be generally concerned that neither enron nor dynegy has made public comments on this 10 q . ' ' ` ` if it is only for a few days , we ' re ok . as long as dynegy doesn ' t pull out of this deal , we should be ok , and enron should maintain its investment grade rating , and all the enron corp . bonds should mature without incident . ' ' ` ` hopefully the company will comment shortly . if there has ever been a company that couldn ' t afford to disclose a time bomb in a 10 q , it is enron . this should have been disclosed prior to this . it added to the crisis of confidence . ' ' ` ` we believe the company will be able to satisfy the $ 690 million note . it appears they should be able to do it from existing liquidity . they could renegotiate the note and / or the other bank facilities that would be jeopardized if they default on the note . ' ' ` ` even our buy recommendation on the enron notes is based on our belief that dynegy ' s management is credible because enron ' s lost all credibility with this disclosure . ' ' on the possibility that enron may be downgraded to junk ratings : ` ` nothing ' s too big to fail , and pg & e proved that . the core business at enron is the trading operation , and it is difficult for people to trade with any firm , particularly an energy trader , if there is any concern they won ' t be able to deliver on their side of the trade . ' ' enron stock punishment deepens debt woes cast pall over merger by tom fowler copyright 2001 houston chronicle november 21 , 2001 the continuing stream of surprises from the depths of enron corp . ' s balance sheet is putting a strain on dynegy ' s plans to buy its beleaguered competitor , but analysts say the deal remains on track . enron ' s share price dropped 23 percent tuesday to $ 6 . 99 after news the company had to restate its third - quarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a $ 690 million iou by monday . the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed . " the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more , " said prudential securities analyst carol coale , referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal . " but at this point dynegy says they ' re still going forward , so i still have a positive outlook on it closing . " the $ 690 million note payable , which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil , had been reported earlier . but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , which happened nov . 12 , was news to analysts and to dynegy . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended . negotiations are under way to do so , he said . the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enron ' s accounting department , said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday , but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations . " the latest twists , while negative , are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not deal - breakers in our opinion , " eassey said . " at the level enron is being purchased , dynegy had clearly baked - in these types of uncertainties into its purchase price . " enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the amount of business they do with the company or keeping close watch of enron ' s credit rating . officials with mirant corp . and aquila said they have cut back on trading while houston - based reliant resources is watching the situation carefully . " we ' re being cautious , monitoring our position with them very closely , " said joe bob perkins , president of reliant resources ' wholesale business . " but i don ' t think that today feels significantly different than it felt a week ago . " perkins said reliant officials read enron ' s 10 - q filing . " the questions we had about that we addressed with enron , " perkins said . he said the fuss over the 10 - q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron . " it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron , " perkins said . that doesn ' t mean analysts are resting easy . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the 10 - q sheds more light on enron finances , the information continues to be released piecemeal , making it likely more surprises are in store . " overall we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position , and its status as a going concern is much in doubt , " meade said . enron has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash and about $ 3 billion in recently negotiated revolving credit lines , as well as $ 800 million in asset sales pending and another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in equity investment expected soon . that could disappear in a hurry , however , if the company ' s credit rating drops one notch to below - investment grade . that would trigger several partnership contracts that would force the company to repay or refinance up to $ 4 billion in debt . credit rating agency standard & poor ' s said tuesday it was maintaining enron ' s rating , but prudential ' s coale is concerned . " the real crisis is in six months , when almost $ 4 billion in debt is expected to mature , " she said . " it ' s not fatalistic , but it is dire .

' s balance sheet is putting a strain on dynegy ' s plans to buy its beleaguered competitor , but analysts say the deal remains on track . enron ' s share price dropped 23 percent tuesday to $ 6 . 99 after news the company had to restate its third - quarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a $ 690 million iou by monday . the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed . " the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more , " said prudential securities analyst carol coale , referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal . " but at this point dynegy says they ' re still going forward , so i still have a positive outlook on it closing . " the $ 690 million note payable , which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil , had been reported earlier . but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , which happened nov . 12 , was news to analysts and to dynegy . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended . negotiations are under way to do so , he said . the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enron ' s accounting department , said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday , but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations . " the latest twists , while negative , are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not deal - breakers in our opinion , " eassey said . " at the level enron is being purchased , dynegy had clearly baked - in these types of uncertainties into its purchase price . " enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the amount of business they do with the company or keeping close watch of enron ' s credit rating . officials with mirant corp . and aquila said they have cut back on trading while houston - based reliant resources is watching the situation carefully . " we ' re being cautious , monitoring our position with them very closely , " said joe bob perkins , president of reliant resources ' wholesale business . " but i don ' t think that today feels significantly different than it felt a week ago . " perkins said reliant officials read enron ' s 10 - q filing . " the questions we had about that we addressed with enron , " perkins said . he said the fuss over the 10 - q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron . " it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron , " perkins said . that doesn ' t mean analysts are resting easy . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the 10 - q sheds more light on enron finances , the information continues to be released piecemeal , making it likely more surprises are in store . " overall we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position , and its status as a going concern is much in doubt , " meade said . enron has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash and about $ 3 billion in recently negotiated revolving credit lines , as well as $ 800 million in asset sales pending and another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in equity investment expected soon . that could disappear in a hurry , however , if the company ' s credit rating drops one notch to below - investment grade . that would trigger several partnership contracts that would force the company to repay or refinance up to $ 4 billion in debt . credit rating agency standard & poor ' s said tuesday it was maintaining enron ' s rating , but prudential ' s coale is concerned .

' ' if enron is out there standing on its own , i don ' t think that ' s sustainable , ' ' said a senior executive of one of enron ' s largest energy - trading competitors . besides dynegy ' s continued commitment to the merger , analysts and industry executives said the most crucial issue for enron was restoring the confidence of investors and trading partners in its financial health . the restatement of earnings two weeks ago and other disclosures about complex dealings with partnerships , some of them run by enron ' s former chief financial officer , had prompted the major credit - rating agencies to rate enron ' s bond ' s at the lowest investment - grade level . ' ' if the rating agencies take them below investment grade , they can ' t do business anymore , ' ' the rival executive said yesterday . ' ' that ' s become almost conventional wisdom . ' ' another downgrade could force enron to pay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , and it could prompt other energy traders to halt dealings with the company entirely . in fact , standard & poor ' s , one of the major credit - rating agencies , gave enron something of a vote of confidence yesterday . while it will continue to review the company for a potential downgrade , s . & p . said , it expects enron ' s near - term financial health ' ' to be sufficient to carry the company through the completion of its proposed merger with dynegy . ' ' s . & p . noted that enron was continuing to negotiate with major banks and other institutions for an infusion of $ 500 million or more in new equity and that enron executives still believed that the company would complete the sale of $ 800 million in assets by the end of the year , raising badly needed cash . major energy trading companies continued to limit their exposure to enron and carefully watch the company ' s financial condition . officials at the el paso corporation and reliant energy , two large energy traders in houston , said yesterday that they continued to do business with enron . but others have pulled back . mirant , a large electricity generator and trader in atlanta , is ' ' trading on a very limited basis , and we don ' t expect to broaden that until enron ' s credit situation improves , ' ' a spokesman said . executives at two other companies that rank among the nation ' s largest traders but who spoke on condition their companies not be identified , also said they had scaled back trading . one of those companies was selling natural gas and electricity to enron only in cases in which the sales helped balance its account with enron , an executive said . ' ' we ' re trying to do business that offsets our risk , ' ' the executive said . ms . denne , the enron spokeswoman , said the company ' s ' ' transaction volume remains within the normal range , ' ' adding that there was ' ' no recognizable change ' ' yesterday in the number of companies willing to trade with enron . ' ' no one significant has dropped off , ' ' she said . analysts said enron ' s disclosures late on monday indicated that the company was using up cash more rapidly than had previously been thought . most of the $ 5 . 5 billion that the company has taken in through equity infusions and borrowings the last month has already been depleted . ' ' the cash burn is greater than anticipated , ' ' said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston . ' ' they are in obvious need of cash . ' ' she estimated that by next summer , enron could be $ 2 billion short of the cash it would need to meet its obligations . ms . coale noted that the $ 690 million obligation whose disclosure shook the markets yesterday was set off by a credit downgrade on nov . 12 - - two days before a conference call with investors . when she asked an enron official yesterday why the matter was not disclosed in the call , ms . coale said , she was told , ' ' we weren ' t aware of that contingency at the time of that call . ' ' donato j . eassey , an analyst in houston with merrill lynch , said in a report that dynegy , too , was unaware of the obligation . he calculated that enron had exhausted about $ 5 billion in cash the last 50 days . ms . denne , the enron spokeswoman , said that the company had paid off $ 1 . 9 billion in short - term i . o . u . ' s , used more than $ 1 billion to post deposits with its trading partners and spent $ 800 million to $ 1 billion to pay off or refinance other loans . the company has about $ 1 . 2 billion in cash , she said , not including $ 450 million from a new line of credit that closed this week and a separate credit line with $ 103 million remaining . jitters about enron ' s future extended to the debt market , where prices for the company ' s bonds fell sharply yesterday . enron ' s short - term bonds fell 5 points , to about 80 cents for each dollar of face value , according to traders in distressed securities . its longer - term debt , maturing in 2004 or later , dropped 10 points , to around 60 cents on the dollar . enron ' s bank debt has not traded recently , these traders said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk enron ' s shares fall on debt concerns from times staff and wire reports 11 / 21 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company houston - - the latest negative disclosures from enron corp . on tuesday pulled its shares down 23 % to a level significantly below the price dynegy inc . had agreed to pay for the beleaguered energy giant , raising concerns that the planned takeover could fall apart or be renegotiated . shares of enron fell $ 2 . 07 to close at $ 6 . 99 on the new york stock exchange after earlier touching $ 6 . 55 - - a low not seen since may 1991 - - on the company ' s report monday of new debt problems and an earnings revision .

' ' now that the sale of dabhol is a certainty , the aggressive enron may be forced to adopt a pragmatic approach during the negotiations , ' ' said k . ravi , a utility analyst with the consulting firm of frost & sullivan . dabhol power ' s 2 , 184 megawatts of generating capacity was the showpiece of an economic liberalization drive in the early 1990 ' s . but enron has had repeated conflicts with politicians and environmentalists over the project . earlier this year , the maharashtra state utility , which has a contract to buy all of dabhol ' s output , complained that the prices were too high and stopped paying its bills , running up $ 64 million in arrears before the power was cut off and the plant shut down . enron raised the stakes in the dispute by serving notice that it would terminate the contract and pull out of the project . but a group of indian state - owned banks and financial institutions , with $ 1 . 4 billion committed to the project , countered with challenges to asset sales by dabhol and with other legal obstacles . earlier this month , a court ordered dabhol not to send the utility a final termination notice until dec . 3 . initially enron adopted a tough posture over the sale of dabhol . kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive and a close friend of president bush , was quoted as saying that india would have to face economic sanctions if the government did not create a favorable climate for the sale of enron ' s stake . but enron now will find little lobbying traction in either washington or new delhi , and the coalition - building diplomacy of the war in afghanistan makes it unlikely that the bush administration would agree to press india on enron ' s behalf . in september , the asking price for enron ' s stake in dabhol power was said to be over $ 1 billion . but the two serious indian bidders - - tata power and bses , both privately owned utilities backed by major industrial concerns here - - are reportedly willing to pay only about half that . if the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take - it - or - leave - it line , enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and swallow a huge loss on a controversial project that once gleamed with promise .

" in light of that , " said mr . gerber , " we would expect to see a bit of an increase in sales on november . " he adds that sales typically drop again in december as people opt to wait another month so they can defer capital gains for another year . in terms of overall purchases , " insiders are obviously finding fewer bargains after this nice market surge , " says jonathan moreland , director of research at newsletter insiderinsights . com . still , he says there are a few sectors where insiders have been indicating they see value in their own shares . among those , he says , are independent power producers , such as aes corp . and nrg energy inc . , which he expects will benefit from the need for new energy plants . he also points to lending institutions household international inc . and metris cos . , which because of their sensitivity to interest - rate moves have suffered on fears of a recession , says mr . moreland . but they are likely to " benefit from the lower interest rates and an economy which will likely strengthen in the next year .

" this is as high a high - wire act as i have ever seen , " analyst john olson of investment house sanders morris harris said . " if this merger is to survive , equity investors will need to have a reason to buy the stock and their confidence will need to be restored , because the equity investor has been leading the way down . " enron ' s hellish tuesday on the market came after the company made new disclosures in a u . s . securities and exchange document , filed after the market closed on monday . most pressing was news that enron has until nov . 26 to put up $ 690 million in collateral against a debt to a partnership . otherwise , the partnership could begin liquidating assets , including a brazilian gas company which enron plans to sell to raise $ 250 million . in the sec filing , known as a form 10 - q , enron said it was suffering a decrease in trading volumes , particularly in longer - term deals . trading volume down since the trading business - enron ' s crown jewel and the segment most coveted by dynegy - is low - margin , volume drives its profitability . it is too early to tell what effect the lower volumes would have on future profitability , enron said , but analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said dynegy will watch the volume drop carefully . " if it has a long - term effect , it will definitely impact the value dynegy will put on this business , " he said . dynegy gave a limited response when asked if it was concerned about lower volumes , and whether it was aware of the $ 690 million debt before it made its deal to acquire enron . " we are in due diligence and enron ' s 10 - q is a part of the that process , " dynegy spokesman john sousa said . meade said the filing yet again showed enron ' s penchant for making disclosures bit - by - bit . of note was its latest downward revision of its third - quarter earnings , he said . " the restatements are coming out piecemeal as they find them , and my guess is they don ' t know the full extent . we think further revisions are likely , " meade said . one analyst who follows enron said the sec filing painted a darker picture of the company ' s cash position , given that it had $ 2 . 3 billion on hand as of nov . 16 . " it shows that the cash drain on the company looks to be very significant , " said the analyst , who asked not to be identified . standard & poor ' s said enron currently has about $ 1 . 5 billion in cash , but that follows an infusion in recent weeks of $ 1 . 5 billion from the dynegy merger , $ 550 million in loans secured by pipeline assets , and $ 3 billion from its revolving credit lines . another $ 450 pipeline - backed loan is expected in a day or two , and enron said it expects $ 500 million of private equity investment plus $ 800 million from asset sales . enron owes $ 9 . 15 billion by the end of next year , and its total liability for debt and other obligations is $ 16 . 86 billion , according to the sec filing . its merger with dynegy is expected to close by the third quarter of 2002 , raising the possibility that an enron without investment - grade credit might not have the liquidity to survive that long . enron acknowledged as much in the sec filing , stating starkly that it would be unlikely to " to continue as a going concern , " if a credit rating cut triggers the early payoff of $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to partnerships to which it belongs . enron said that if its rating were cut , it would work out other payment arrangements . s & p said a similar effort being undertaken in the case of the $ 690 million debt will likely be successful " given the alignment of the interests between enron and the banks . " enron spokesman vance meyer said the company had received verbal indications that the deadline on that debt was going to be extended , but it details had yet to be worked out . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : corrected - accounts board to eye peer reviews amid enron furor . 11 / 20 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . in washington story headlined " accounts board to eye peer reviews amid enron furor , " please read in 3 rd paragraph . . . many of them were raised in a letter sent recently to bowsher by rep . john dingell . . . instead of . . . many of them were raised in a letter sent recently to bowsher by rep . charles dingell ( corrects rep . dingell ' s first name ) . a corrected repetition follows . by kevin drawbaugh washington , nov 20 ( reuters ) - the regulatory panel that oversees big u . s . accounting firms plans to discuss concerns about its " peer review " process and other issues at its next meeting in december , the panel ' s chairman said on tuesday . amid growing concern about the enron corp debacle and the accountants involved in it , public oversight board chairman charles bowsher said , " there ' s just a lot of problems in this enron case , some really significant problems . " many of them were raised in a letter sent recently to bowsher by rep . john dingell , who called on the board to investigate arthur andersen , auditor to enron , the houston energy trader rocked in past weeks by a series of setbacks , including a securities and exchange commission investigation . " the investigation of this situation is one being done by the sec . . . the pob does not do individual investigations , " bowsher said in a telephone interview with reuters . but he added that dingell did " raise other issues in his letter that get to our responsibilities , like the overall quality of the processes and standards that the firms use . that ' s what we ' ve got to look at and deal with . " dingell , a michigan democrat , specifically questioned a " peer review " system overseen by the board which the congressman complained has never resulted in a qualified review being filed by one major accounting firm about another . very good processes , very good people bowsher confirmed dingell ' s assertion , but added that a qualified review of one firm by another would be drastic and likely has not been deserved by any of the nation ' s biggest accounting firms since the review process started in 1978 . " what there have been as part of these peer reviews is recommendations in areas that need to be improved , " he said . " the real facts of life are these big firms have very good processes . they hire very good people . they train them very well and they have 10 , 000 audits that go well each year . but there ' s no question we ' ve had a series of big problem audits that bring the whole process into concern . . . we can ' t ignore the fact that we ' ve had these . that ' s one of the things we ' re going to be thinking a lot about at our december meeting . " enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending in the wake of revelations about certain unusual deals with outside partnerships involving company officers . enron earlier this month said it planned to be acquired by dynegy inc . critics have said arthur andersen should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to the company ' s unusual finances . similar complaints have been voiced in recent years about the performance of auditors of other companies . in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management inc . , a garbage hauling concern , in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges . copyright ?

heim : well , enron filed their 10 q last night , as i think everyone knows , and it did include a modest restatement , but i don ` t really think that ` s the big news . more of concern is the debt obligation that you talked about , although even that is - - $ 690 million is manageable . but i think the 10 k filing has addressed many of the previous concerns about some of these limited related party partnership that enron has and the obligations , the backstopping enron has provided with those partnerships . hays : michael , could you just tell us a little bit more about that ? because it , it - - i get - - it ` s so complicated , i really have - - you know , have a hard time following it after a while . and what i can ` t understand is , presumably , the reason they were opposing this deal , dynagy and enron , is that dynagy knew what was going on , figured they were a lot of deals like this , so one - - i ` m kind of surprised that they would be talking about maybe triggering the material adverse charge at this point , which could get them out of the deal . i mean , they say they ` re not going to do it , but bankers say they ` re talking about it . so what ` s going on here ? heim : well , it ` s not unusual for deals to have a material adverse condition clause , and there was a lot that ` s unknown in enron . it ` s a very difficult company to follow , and dynagy certainly has done a lot of due diligence . but it was in a crash period , and i ` m sure there ` s a lot of questions dynagy has with enron as well . the - - dynagy was very careful on how they worded the deal and left themselves some outs . and i don ` t know if they ` re going to try and take advantage of those outs . but certainly i ` m sure they share a lot of the concerns that enron investors have . francis : is there another shoe to drop next week when these obligations come due on the 26 th ? heim : well . . . francis : and should we be braced for another big day in - - for enron stock , or has it found a basement ? heim : well , that ` s a very tough question to answer . certainly anybody who ` s been negative on the stock has done so not because they knew there were some problems coming , but because they didn ` t know that there weren ` t problems coming . and i certainly can ` t say that there isn ` t other problems that could be disclosed . yes , in situations like this , you have to rely a little bit on the company . and unfortunately the company ` s reputation ` s already been stained . francis : michael , you got a sell on the stock . is there a point at which this issue becomes attractive , or are there just too many potential bodies buried here ? heim : well , i ` m a firm believer there ` s always a point at which stock becomes attractive . but at this point , it ` s really become a betting game on whether the deal gets done . and there are certainly people , a lot of people speculating on that , both sides , and as an analyst , i don ` t know if you necessarily have a more insight to that type of question than somebody else . it ` s not a bet that we want to take at these prices . hays : ok , well , michael hime , you certainly , certainly got a lot of reasons , i guess , not to take the bet , certainly not before you have to . michael heim , a . g . edwards energy analyst , thank you so much for joining us . hime : thank you . francis : thanks . we appreciate it . copyright ?

' s salomon smith barney lobbied the credit - rating company , people familiar with the situation said . avoiding junk a junk rating would have led dynegy to abandon the acquisition , dynegy chief executive officer charles watson said . it would also have triggered debt repayment of at least $ 3 . 9 billion , enron said in a securities & exchange commission filing yesterday . enron shares are selling for almost 32 percent less than the value of dynegy ' s offer , showing investors have doubts the deal will be completed . dynegy shares fell $ 1 . 90 to $ 41 . 70 today . ` ` it ' s become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren ' t 90 percent , but much closer to fifty - fifty , ' ' said edward paik , who helps manage the liberty utilities fund , with 1 . 6 million enron shares . ` ` there ' s just so much information that is unknowable ' ' about enron ' s financial position , he said . most of the $ 9 . 15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter of 2002 , when the dynegy buyout is scheduled to close , enron said yesterday in a filing with the sec . asset sales planned last week , enron chief operating officer greg whalley said the company will sell assets of ` ` non - core businesses ' ' to raise money . it has $ 8 billion invested in the businesses , including broadband telecommunications and the dabhol power plant in india . enron expects to get ` ` billions ' ' from the sales , whalley said , without being more specific . enron reported yesterday that its u . s . operations had $ 1 . 2 billion in cash left . it has added at least $ 5 billion since sept . 30 from credit lines , loans and a $ 1 . 5 billion investment from chevrontexaco , part owner of dynegy . short - term debt enron used $ 1 . 9 billion of the money it raised to retire commercial paper , which is short - term debt . it gave no details on how it spent the remaining $ 3 . 1 billion . enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said last week that the company also was looking to get another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion from private investors . asset sales valued at about $ 800 million are expected to close by the end of this year , according to the sec filing . enron spokeswoman denne wouldn ' t comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts . dynegy will have to help enron sell assets , said mitchell stapley , who manages $ 3 . 5 billion in fixed - income assets including enron bonds for fifth third investment advisors inc . dynegy and chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , also will have to help enron negotiate with its lenders , said kathleen vuchetich , who helps manage the $ 1 . 4 billion strong american utilities fund , which is 5 percent dynegy shares . ` ` i never dreamt ( the $ 9 . 15 billion ) would be that large , coming due all at once , ' ' vuchetich said . ` ` it calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place . ' ' chevrontexaco chevrontexaco , the second - largest u . s . oil company , is providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout . it provided the first $ 1 . 5 billion a week ago . in exchange for that investment , dynegy will get a pipeline valued at more than $ 2 billion if the enron purchase is not completed . shares of chevrontexaco , based in san francisco , rose $ 3 . 62 to $ 86 . 53 . enron yesterday reduced third - quarter results by 3 cents a share , bringing the period ' s loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million . on nov . 8 , enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $ 586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books . that included a third - quarter reduction of $ 17 million . a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by standard ticker : ene ; url : ) losing steam again today . the stock closing down $ 2 . 07 at $ 6 99 cents a share . a nearly 10 - year low . investors apparently concerned about a potential cash crunch at the embattled energy firm . joining us with more on enron ` s troubles is floyd norris , financial editor with ` ` the new york times . ' ' welcome to the program . floyd norris , financial editor , ` ` the new york times ' ' : thank you . romans : this has been a fascinating story and stock to watch develop . first off , what is the latest that drove this stock down more than 20 percent again today ? norris : well , yesterday , after the close , they filed a report with the securities and exchange commission , and as people studied it overnight , they were quite surprised . and it got worse this morning . they disclosed that they have $ 690 million in debt . so they may have to pay next week if they can ` t either come up with collateral , which will not be easy , or persuade the lenders to renegotiate . and what was shocking about that wasn ` t that the debt existed , that was known , it was that they had to pay it so quickly . it turns out , according to what people are telling analysts , that dynegy ( company : dynegy inc . ; ticker : dyn ; url : ) , which agreed to buy them only a week or two ago , didn ` t know about this . they had not told them , apparently , enron didn ` t realize they had this problem . romans : ok , wait . there seems to be a lot of things that wall street didn ` t know was going on . and every sort of revelation is a big blow to the stock . who is watching what ` s happening here and how can there be so many surprises . that ` s confusing to a lot of folks who are following this . norris : well , it ` s - the fact wall street is surprised isn ` t necessarily surprising , but the fact that enron seems to have been surprised is surprising . they ` ve had a lot of turnover . it reinforces the suspicion that jeff skilling , the chief executive officer who quit in mid - year , and perhaps the treasury and chief financial officer , both of whom were ousted within the last month as this crisis grew , may have been the only people who really understood what was going on there ; and that makes you wonder what else might yet come out . romans : well , what about auditors and what about the board governing this firm . and what about ken lay , i mean he is sort of the statesman of the industry , isn ` t he ? and he ` s running this company again ? norris : well , he ` s back running the company . the suspicion is , and lay denies it , he says he knows what ` s going on , my suspicion is that he didn ` t know the details . he trusted . he understood the company was overvalued , probably . this is a man who was taking out hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock , exercising stock options and selling stock . but i suspect he didn ` t understand all of the details and now they are coming back to haunt him . the other thing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the company is burning through cash at an amazing rate . and enron has not really given us a good understanding of why they are burning through the cash that fast . but it raises questions about whether the company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken over by dynegy by next september . and , of course , the way the stock is trading , it ` s obvious that a lot of people on wall street doubt that deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through on the announced terms . tracy eichler , ubs painewebber : floyd , my question regarding shareholder lawsuits . it seems like there ` s some validity there . any new news on the sec investigation and the magnitude to those lawsuits ? norris : there ` s no news on the sec investigation . there are , of course , huge shareholder lawsuits . they ` re filed against enron , they ` re filed against the current and former officers of the company . and they ` re filed against arthur andersen , which audited this company . the accounting regulators are already starting to check in again on arthur andersen , which used to be the class of the accounting business and has had a string of recent embarrassments . romans : all right , floyd norris for ` ` the new york times , ' ' thank you so much for joining us . norris : thank you .

2	Subject: re : gwen koepke anne , thanks for contacting me about this . as a matter of fact , i wanted to talk to you about it today as this matter was outstanding for a long time . i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager , effective march 1 . the compensation would be her current base plus 10 k . this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager . such promotions take place in march and i think gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management ( i . e . my and maureen ' s procrastination ) . on unrelated and more serious matter . gary hickerson is the primary client for maureen ' s services . he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite maureen ' s position ( he is in general unhappy with her contribution ) . this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron . given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge . gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget . i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes . vince from : anne labbe / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 02 / 2001 10 : 34 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : gwen koepke vince , just wanted to touch base with you . i have tried to contact maureen so that gwen ' s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested , but have not heard any response from her . would you like for me to wait until i hear from maureen or should i go ahead and proceed in changing her title ? i just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc . also , i am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing , and your expectations during prc . thanks , anne

" the language in the order says no more da contracts can be entered into after today . the order directs the utilities to police the dasrs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today . there is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties " on notice " that , in this future order , they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after july 1 , 2001 . our attorneys are reviewing this , but on first blush , our california attorney says the cpuc would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of da .

2	Subject: ferc meeting : market based rate review the commission discussed its market based rate policy at today ' s meeting . they did not vote out an order today , but expect to take up this issue again next meeting . the staff memo recommended the following : for an interim period , ferc will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations , using a new test called the " supply margin assessment " ( also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test ) where a seller ' s capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market . the test takes into account constraints based on ttc . if the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand , the seller does not have market power . this test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing rto or iso . for those selling into an rto / iso , the ferc will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation . staff also recommends that ferc initiate a section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner , the ferc can require refunds . through questioning by commissioner massey , it was revealed that , even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior , but sold into a disfunctional market , refunds could be required . in the staff memo , apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly . however , commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds . this policy will be brought up again at the next commission meeting on october 11 . it will be issued as a proposed action , giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments , final action is expected within 60 - 90 days . last , for the long - term , ferc will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected . since the interim measure is only a " snapshot " approach according to commissioner massey , he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision . commissioner breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement , stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability .

2	Subject: thestreet . com : trade winds blowing enron further south trade winds blowing enron further south by peter eavis senior columnist 08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation . a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings . for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double . now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower . in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move . enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman . but skeptics remain unconvinced . " i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , " says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected . details , details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . ) enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . ) enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold . however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter . the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit . partners indeed the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently . the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line . the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results . then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as " significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . " some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels . skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ? in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million . put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ? an enron spokeswoman responds : " eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . " and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal . a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers . this person also says the gain was " immaterial " to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states . whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . " they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , " concludes off wall street ' s roberts . know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com . in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships .

2	Subject: sap go - live review by aa richard - attached is an outline of the involvement we ' ve engaged aa to perform for each business unit as they go - live onto sap . please remember that ena is going live onto sap ' s " common design " that has already been reviewed by aa from a internal controls perspective . so this attachment outlines those items outside of " common design " that wanda and sally probably want covered from an ena perspective . as a rule of thumb , this proposed scope equates to $ 100 k - $ 150 k in fees to aa that is over & above the audit budget . one word of advice : designate a lead within ena that has the time to stay on top of the project , schedule meetings with aa , and coordinate their involvement with the sap team members , e . g . not wanda or sally , but at a director / manager level at least . i was the designee for corp and ensured that aa kept the project going . also , i worked extensively with the janet tran , sap lead director responsible for bringing corp up . some big benefits : kept aa out of sap ' s hair when things got rough . made sure that the sap team knew what our goals & objectives were , especially when we found something that needed fixed before go - live . managed that in fact aa provided us a deliverable at the end of the project . please review and call if you need other info . i ' d be glad to assist ena too . i assisted europe ( naomi connell ) and int ' l cos ( john berggren ) . they appreciated having a " co - pilot " and we avoided duplication of effort with what had already been done for the prior go - lives . also , they felt that value was rec ' d for dollars paid to aa for this work . terrie

2	Subject: more details on kern river expansion williams to expand kern river by 124 , 500 dth / d kern river gas transmission , a subsidiary of williams , said it planned on filing an application yesterday with ferc to add 124 , 500 dth / d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922 - mile pipeline system . the company said the california expansion project will not only provide additional natural gas capacity from wyoming to markets in california , but also will provide an opportunity for williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on the recent approval by ferc of kern river ' s extended term rate program . " a combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas - fired power generation facilities in california is fueling expansion of the system , " said kirk morgan , director of business development for kern river and northwest pipeline . the project includes construction of three new compressor stations , an additional compressor at an existing facility in wyoming , restaging a compressor in utah , and upgrading two meter stations . kern river said the $ 80 million project is targeted to be complete by may 1 , 2002 . the company said demand for firm transportation on kern river was driven by several factors : the diversion of canadian gas supplies to markets in the midwest from the pacific region ; increased production in the rocky mountain basin ; strong economic growth in kern river ' s market areas ; and increased demand from gas - fired electric generation facilities . williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the kern river pipeline . " the demand for competitively priced transportation to markets in nevada and california continues to grow . at the same time , gas producers in the rocky mountain basin are stepping up production . an expansion on kern river in 2003 could help bring that production to market , " said morgan .

' s ( ene ) disclosure of a formal inquiry into partnerships with its former chief financial officer left some wall street analysts concerned thursday that the probe could spill over into the company ' s core business , placing further pressure on the company ' s stock . other analysts said they doubted the investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission would spread , but added that the uncertainty was weighing on enron ' s share price . " it ' s a huge cloud of uncertainty , " said merrill lynch analyst steve fleishman , who wouldn ' t speculate about the breadth of the investigation . enron said late wednesday that the sec has elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into " certain of the matters that were the subject of recent press reports . " the sec , as a matter of policy , declined to comment on the status or scope of any inquiry . enron spokeswoman karen denne said it was her understanding that the formal investigation , like the informal inquiry , would be limited to the partnerships . enron is fully cooperating with the sec , she said . robert christensen , an analyst with fac equities in new york , said he is concerned the sec could use its subpoena power to start probing enron ' s natural gas and trading practices . " i ' m hoping that it ' s localized to the partnership with andy fastow and deals truly with the partnership as opposed to wandering into the basic interest of enron , which is wholesale trading , " christensen said . enron and its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , set up complicated vehicles to invest in and hedge enron assets . last month , enron disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown of shareholder equity in the third quarter related to transactions it had carried out with those entities , setting off a 65 % drop in the value of the company ' s stock in the past two weeks . investors are already pricing in the possibility the sec investigation will reveal more bad news , christensen said . " if it is limited to the partnership activities , which caused $ 1 . 2 billion to evaporate on the equity line , that would be well received , " he said . " i think the stock price now is reflecting the concerns that there is something greater behind the wood pile of all these partnerships . " thursday afternoon , enron ' s shares were down $ 1 . 90 , or 14 % , at $ 12 . the shares have lost two - thirds of their value over the past two weeks . gary hoves , an analyst with argus research in new york , said enron ' s shares will continue to trade lower on news of the sec inquiry . " this is a serious situation , especially since the investigation moved from forth worth to washington d . c . , " hoves said . " it ' s hard to say , but my guess is this will be an open - book investigation and they will go into a whole lot of stuff beyond the partnership .

" ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside , we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on enron until the investigation concludes , " said donato eassey of merrill lynch , who lowered his rating on enron ' s stock to " neutral " from " accumulate " earlier on thursday . secured credit - in enron ' s case credit lines backed by gas and pipeline assets - often is reserved for companies with " junk " credit ratings , though many analysts saw the credit as a positive for enron . shares of enron continued their freefall , despite the company ' s announcement of new credit lines , after the securities and exchange commission said late wednesday it would make an informal inquiry into the company a full - scale investigation . enron lost $ 1 . 35 , or 9 . 7 percent , to $ 12 . 55 , resuming a tailspin that began oct . 16 when the company announced it was taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges for ill - fated investments . enron said the investment banking arm of j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . , the brokerage and investment banking unit of citigroup inc . , agreed to provide $ 1 billion in credit lines backed by enron ' s northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . assets . ' a positive step ' analysts said it is difficult to gauge the downside of the sec ' s probe of enron , which began as a request for information and became a full - fledged investigation , which provides regulators the ability to subpoena company documents . some analysts said the general economic environment after sept . 11 has tightened lending restrictions and the secured issue is not ominous . " it is a positive step . they will be surrounded by uncertainty until the sec probe is finalized and then they can go about their business . assuming everything is above board , and they just come out with a conflict of interest , the sec probe will probably result in a fine that will be a significant slap on the wrist . " said raymond moore of weatherly securities . other see it as a possible buying opportunity . " if the stock price gets to low - double digits , we might change our rating , " said mike heim , analyst with a . g . edwards who rates enron as " hold / speculative . " " our decision not to raise our rating when shares dipped below $ 12 reflects concerns that enron ' s problems may be affecting their trading operations , " enron said the credit lines will be used to supplement short - term liquidity , refinance maturing obligations and augment the $ 1 billion the company has of cash on hand . the commitments are subject to customary terms and conditions , including final due diligence , the company said . " this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , " said jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s new chief financial officer .

" this is just taking profits . the weather is spotty , and the only thing that is going to sustain this uptrend , which i think is already overdone , is an early and sustained winter , " one northeast trader said , adding that ample gas supplies would also limit the upside . other traders said they believed part of the recent run - up in gas prices was due to a steady spate of short - covering in recent days by enron , whose share price has been hammered after a series of disclosures about off - balance - sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . moody ' s investors service cut enron ' s credit rating on monday to two notches above junk status and warned it could lower the rating on the company ' s senior unsecured debt even further , as well as cut enron ' s short - term debt status . enron is one of largest traders of wholesale natural gas and electricity in the united states . many dealers said they were a bit surprised by the larger - than - expected build in weekly aga inventory data released wednesday . aga data showed u . s . gas stocks rose last week by 23 bcf , below reuters survey estimates for a 35 - 40 bcf build , and well - below the year - ago gain of 70 bcf and the five - year average injection for this week of 35 bcf . total inventories of 3 . 090 tcf are still 378 bcf , or 14 percent , above last year and 237 bcf above the five year average . traders said some in the producing region may have been selling cheaper baseload gas into the spot market to cash in on the steep premium to index . storage now stands at 94 percent full and could still climb to a record 3 . 13 tcf this week , the last week of the stock - building season , traders said . despite wednesday ' s late spike , many traders remained skeptical of the upside , citing concerns about record levels of gas in inventory for winter and sagging demand due to a slowing u . s . economy . but some said recent talk about further terror attacks in the u . s . created uncertainty in the market that could limit the selling . in terms of heating degree days ( hdds ) , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) said it expected 87 hdds this week , or 2 below normal . noaa also forecasted 5 cdds this week , which is 1 below normal . the national weather service 6 - 10 day forecast released wednesday called for above normal temperatures for most of the nation , except in the east and parts of the west , where seasonal or below seasonal readings are expected . noaa recently issued a winter weather outlook calling for colder - than - normal temperatures for northeast , upper midwest and plains states , with the possibility of heavy snow in the midwest and along the east coast . while chart watchers said the technical picture turned bullish last week when the december gap to $ 3 . 252 was filled and the down trendline from april was broken , most agreed the upside may be limited near - term by milder late - week weather forecasts . they now pegged december resistance at wednesday ' s high of $ 3 . 44 , with further selling expected at $ 3 . 76 and then at the august high of $ 4 . 10 . psychological support was seen in the $ 3 . 00 area , with support also at last week ' s low of $ 2 . 77 and at the trendline in the low - $ 2 . 70 s . further buying was expected at $ 2 . 66 - 2 . 67 and then in the $ 2 . 60 area . the october low was $ 2 . 535 . the contract low was $ 2 . 415 . in the cash today , henry hub swing quotes on average slipped about 7 cents to the $ 3 . 00 area . midwest pipes were down 5 to 10 cents to the mid - $ 2 . 80 s . in the west , gas at waha hub in west texas was about 10 cents lower in the mid - $ 2 . 80 s . swing gas on transco at the new york city gate skidded about 20 cents to the mid - $ 3 . 30 s , while chicago was around 10 to 15 cents lower near $ 3 . 10 . nymex said an estimated 16 , 414 henry hub contracts traded at 11 : 40 a . m . est . henry hub open interest on oct . 31 eased 129 lots to 457 , 861 . nymex has been holding abbreviated floor trading sessions following the sept . 11 attacks on the world trade center . nymex gas open outcry trade will run from 10 : 00 a . m . to 2 : 30 p . m . , with the internet - based access session held from 3 : 15 p . m . to 9 : 00 a . m . , through dec . 31 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron corp .

' ' the ratings of enron ' s subsidiaries , transwestern pipeline co . and northern natural gas . , were lowered to ` ` bbb ' ' from ` ` a - ' ' to bring them in line with the parent company ratings . enron has $ 15 . 8 billion of debt outstanding , according to bloomberg data . enron gets $ 1 bln loan to bolster cash , credit rating ( update 8 ) 2001 - 11 - 01 16 : 59 ( new york ) enron gets $ 1 bln loan to bolster cash , credit rating ( update 8 ) ( adds s & p credit rating downgrade in fourth paragraph . ) houston , nov . 1 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , received a $ 1 billion loan from j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . after agreeing to use the company ' s natural - gas pipelines as collateral . enron shares fell 14 percent a day after the u . s . securities and exchange commission began formally investigating partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . pledging the pipelines signals enron ' s desperation to convince shareholders and trading partners that it ' s creditworthy , investors said . ` ` it ' s not reassuring , it ' s worrisome , ' ' said donald coxe , manager of the harris insight equity fund , which owns about 78 , 000 enron shares . ` ` if they had to secure the loan , obviously the lenders don ' t think they can rely on enron ' s financial statements . ' ' after u . s . markets closed , standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s long - term credit rating to ` ` bbb , ' ' the second - lowest investment grade , from ` ` bbb + . ' ' the energy trader ' s short - term debt rating was cut to ` ` a - 3 , ' ' the lowest investment grade , from ` ` a - 2 . ' ' the sec is investigating partnerships run by former cfo andrew fastow that bought and sold enron shares and assets . those trades cost enron $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity . questions about enron ' s dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of commercial - paper markets , where most large corporations go to find low - interest , short - term debt . last friday , enron tapped a $ 3 billion credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding . proceeds from the $ 1 billion secured loan will go for debt payments and to supplement cash reserves , enron said . business with enron to get the $ 1 billion loan , enron pledged assets of its northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , which own gas pipeline systems that combined are about 19 , 000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic feet of gas a day . enron , based in houston , got its start as a natural gas - pipeline operator . over the past decade , the company has shed assets such as pipelines and power plants and focused on trading electricity , gas , wood pulp and other commodities . enron now accounts for about a quarter of u . s . power and gas trades . the company still has about 25 , 000 miles of gas pipeline . mortgaging those lines is ` ` maybe not such a good signal , ' ' said roger hamilton , who manages john hancock value funds , which owns 600 , 000 enron shares . ` ` it shows they can ' t convince banks with anything but secured assets . ' ' shares of enron fell $ 1 . 91 to $ 11 . 99 . earlier , they dropped to $ 11 . 70 . the stock has fallen 86 percent this year . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell about 3 cents today to be bid at 74 cents on the dollar and offered at 77 cents , traders said . until last week , the notes were trading near par value . credit rating enron must have investment - grade credit to borrow enough to settle its transactions daily . energy companies including exelon corp . and northeast utilities have restricted business with enron as the company sought new sources of credit . on monday , moody ' s investors service lowered enron ' s long - term credit rating to ` ` baa 2 ' ' from ` ` baal , ' ' two notches above junk status . it also placed the company ' s ` ` p - 2 ' ' rating for commercial paper on review for possible downgrade . standard & poor ' s said in downgrading enron ' s credit rating today that the company has enough liquidity to see it through the ` ` current period of uncertainty . ' ' still , s & p said , enron ' s ` ` financial flexibility has continued to diminish ' ' because of its ` ` inability to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of enron ' s core energy marketing business . ' ' falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment terms for affiliated companies such as the ones created by fastow . a lower credit rating also reduces the amount of cash that enron can raise to back its trading business . investor confidence the financing is to ` ` enhance market and investor confidence , ' ' enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said in a statement . enron can borrow another $ 200 million by bringing other banks into the loan , spokeswoman karen denne said . ` ` we don ' t have any plans to do so at this point , ' ' she said . ` ` we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating , ' ' mcmahon said . mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo last week . fastow was ousted in an attempt to restore investor confidence . ` ` it seems until we know more about the sec investigation , it ' s going to be a difficult time for the stock , ' ' said tara gately , an energy analyst at loomis sayles & co . , which sold most of its enron shares early last year . j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of part of its azurix north america water business to american water works inc . for $ 148 . 8 million in cash and assumed debt . salomon smith barney is the investment - banking arm of citigroup inc . enron falls after sec steps up probe cbsmarketwatch . com , 11 / 01 / 01 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - enron shares fell for the 11 th time in 12 sessions thursday after the energy merchant said the securities and exchange commission launched a formal investigation into two of its limited partnerships . late wednesday , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power trader said it retained william mclucas , a partner in the washington , d . c . - based firm of wilmer , cutler & pickering and a former sec enforcement chief , as its counsel . mclucas works at the same firm as stephen cutler once did . the sec named cutler its enforcement division chief on oct . 25 , giving him oversight of the program in d . c . and in 11 regional and district offices across the country . according to a sec press release , cutler specialized in " securities enforcement and litigation " while a partner at wilmer , cutler & pickering . howard meyers , a partner in the new york city - based law firm of meyers & heim and a former staff attorney in the sec ' s northeast regional office , said the mclucas - cutler connection could give the appearance of a conflict of interest . " whether there is or not , i don ' t know , " he said . " if there isn ' t an actual conflict , you don ' t want to give the appearance of one . the sec is a substantial regulatory agency that the public has to have confidence in . " as new enforcement chief , cutler has a duty to remove himself from any potential conflicts , meyers said . " generally speaking , i like to see someone a little more removed from any preexisting relationships , " he said . no conflict , enron says karen denne , an enron spokesperson , said enron is " satisfied that wilmer , cutler has no conflict , and the sec can speak for itself on that issue . " she said cutler left wilmer , cutler three years ago and " severed all contacts . " " as you know , the commission conducts its investigations on a non - public basis and thus we cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation that may or may not be taking place , " said michael robinson , an sec spokesperson . " applicable government - wide ethics rules required that mr . cutler recuse himself from all matters involving wilmer , cutler for one year following his departure from the firm , and he did so . " additionally , robinson said : " the sec ' s ethics office has confirmed that mr . cutler ' s involvement in matters in which wilmer , cutler plays a role is entirely consistent with applicable government - wide conflict rules , as well as ethics rules applicable to all attorneys . " enron shares closed at $ 11 . 99 , down $ 1 . 91 , or about 14 percent . by session ' s end , 30 million shares had changed hands . enron also said it had formed a special committee , headed by university of texas law school dean william powers , to deal with the sec . john gavin , president of plymouth , minn . - based sec insight , said that despite public assurances to the contrary , enron ' s announcements wednesday make it apparent that the company has " decided it is no longer in its interest to cooperate with the sec . " " as a formal investigation , the sec must now use its subpoena power to compel the production of documents and witnesses . the assembly of a high - powered legal team is further evidence this company is digging in for a fight , " he said . initially , the sec decided to pursue an informal inquiry into related - party transactions involving the company . now , the sec is making this a formal investigation . as such , the agency would investigate whether the company disclosed all that was required with regard to the related - party transactions , meyers said , adding that the most important factor in the case ' s transition to a formal investigation is that the sec can exercise subpoena power . disclosure is highly important because it can determine whether an investor buys stock in a company or not , he added . after the existence of the two limited partnerships came to light , the stock plunged . " the sec might take a look at the auditors of enron , and certainly the sec can take action against the officers of the company , " meyers said . " any officer that signs off on 10 - qs or 10 - ks could be liable . " merrill lynch analyst donato eassey downgraded enron thursday to " neutral " from " accumulate / buy , " citing the uncertainty about the outcome of the sec investigation . " we believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap enron ' s stock price in the mid - teen ' s while increasing overall volatility , " eassey wrote in a note to clients . the investigation will way on the stock until it concludes . " timing is uncertain , but could feasibly take months . " secures $ 1 billion in credit enron also said it secured $ 1 billion in additional financing from j . p . morgan and salomon smith barney . the new credit , supported by assets of enron ' s northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline , will help enron shore up its liquidity position . " we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment - grade rating , " said chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon , in a statement . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com .

2	Subject: re : out of interest calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for pastoria was overpriced by $ 9 . 9 mm , the amount of the catalytica credit . a brief confusing history as i understand it . . . ena east and west jointly owned the catalytica equity account in 1999 . it was written up based on expectations of an ipo value . at 12 / 99 it transferred to west power because catalytica entered into an agreement with pastoria to provide the project with its zonon technology . this agreement included a commitment from ge to do research / work in order to use the catalytica technology on ge turbines . the cost of this ( $ 9 . 9 mm ) was added to the pastoria turbine contract . in feb 2000 , when i arrived in portland , i had the catalytica account transferred to the portfolio because i thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ena west power . in mid - 2000 the agreement was restructured in order to " clean up " catalytica so it could ipo . at that time , enron was credited back the $ 9 . 9 mm from catalytica and it was decided by delainey that that amount should be split 2 / 3 - pastoria and 1 / 3 catalytica equity , with the 2 / 3 going to ena west power upon the sale of pastoria . pastoria did not get the full $ 9 . 9 mm back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings . at this time , since there is no funds transfer , i believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the merchant portfolio to ena west power . louise kitchen 03 / 22 / 2001 08 : 33 am to : christopher f calger / pdx / ect @ ect cc : subject : out of interest what happens under the pastoria deal to the catalytica credit - did it go to calpine or are you using it in the other turbine purchases ?

' s planned acquisition of enron . mr . lay ' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice . early in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay ' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities . but by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn ' t attend the traders ' meeting , senior managers told him that " opinions were expressed that he shouldn ' t receive the payment , " mr . palmer said . " he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . " the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day . the initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . " things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , " mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director . for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation . enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies . separately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board " failed in its responsibility " to monitor the activities of enron executives . mr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling ' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 . under the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million . mr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn ' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron ' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay ' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay . mr . palmer said it is a " cheap shot " to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . " the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , " mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing " the very best service possible . " mark lay couldn ' t be reached for comment . coming on top of disclosures of enron ' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron ' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships . mark lay ' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and " certain other individuals " who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron ' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up " a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , " according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron ' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business . as part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to " convey " to enron " certain intangible property rights " from ppmc . mark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer . since 1985 , sharon lay ' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm ' s revenue in some years . she said her brother ' s position was " more a problem " than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn ' t worked hard enough to get enron ' s business . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . inside track enron ceo cut stakes in firms where he sits in director ' s seat by cassell bryan - low staff reporter of the wall street journal 11 / 14 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 4 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) kenneth l . lay , enron corp .

' ' ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether , ' ' mr . palmer said . even if dynegy ' s directors later voted to award mr . lay a new severance agreement , he would turn it down , mr . palmer added . ' ' what ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts , that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control , ' ' mr . palmer said . ' ' this issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it . ' ' severance pay had been an awkward matter for mr . lay in the last week . the only reason that enron was being acquired - - putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect - - were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch . the company ' s shares have lost almost 90 percent of their value after peaking in the summer of 2000 . during merger discussions last week , mr . lay told dynegy ' s chairman , charles l . watson , that he wanted to rework the severance package , mr . palmer said . on monday , mr . watson disclosed that mr . lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options . by yesterday afternoon , enron officials were saying that mr . lay planned to take two - thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation . and , they said , he wanted to give half of that amount , or one - third of his total package , to establish a charitable foundation to benefit enron employees . it was about an hour later that enron said mr . lay would give up the severance entirely . mr . lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company , which will be called dynegy . the deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at enron . whether mr . lay ' s gesture will placate enron ' s traders , who are now deluging other energy - trading companies with resumes , remains to be seen . dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than enron , and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent , and value , from the combined company . ' ' so much of their top talent is going out the door , i don ' t know what dynegy gets , ' ' said a senior executive at another rival firm . the stunning near - collapse of enron - - bankruptcy was only averted , some analysts say , by the dynegy acquisition - - closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business . the ugly circumstances of enron ' s downfall , including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company ' s balance sheet and that enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost $ 600 million , have left mr . lay ' s reputation in tatters . just months ago , mr . lay was widely hailed - - or decried , in some circles - - as the genius behind energy deregulation . his friend , george w . bush , had been elected president , and policies favored by enron were front and center in the administration ' s energy policy . mr . lay retired from day - to - day management , making plans to pursue new business interests . but he again assumed the chief executive ' s post at enron in august , after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor , jeffrey k . skilling , and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed . on monday , mr . lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer , but he declined to say what those plans were . even without the severance package , mr . lay has become enormously wealthy running enron . all told , from 1989 through this year , mr . lay collected about $ 13 million in salary ( his exact salary for this year is not known ) and $ 26 . 8 million in cash bonuses . but those sums were dwarfed by the $ 266 . 7 million in profits that he received in selling stock . the bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years : $ 13 . 1 million in 1998 , $ 43 . 9 million in 1999 , $ 123 . 4 million in 2000 and $ 20 . 7 million this year - - a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through july 31 , and then stopped , not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining . the options he has cashed in recent years , as well as those he now owns , are badly out of the money at enron ' s current stock price of $ 9 . 98 , down from a peak reached in 2000 of $ 90 . 75 . his bonus in 2000 was $ 7 million , an award that enron ' s board said was based on the company ' s rising profits and high shareholder return . the company restated those profits last week , explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules . it said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was then enron ' s chief financial officer . the company ' s stock price , which was in free fall after questions about the fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the securities and exchange commission , fell to $ 7 a share in the wake of the disclosures . that was the lowest price for the stock since 1991 . it rebounded to nearly $ 10 after dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap . in january , enron ' s board awarded another bonus to mr . lay , of $ 3 . 6 million . that was based entirely on the company ' s shareholder return from 1997 through 2000 , which came to 294 percent , the company said . all of that return has since been wiped out . also in january , mr . lay was awarded 106 , 578 shares of restricted stock , to vest periodically through 2004 . all the shares will now vest when the dynegy deal is completed , and while their value has plunged , the award is still worth more than $ 1 million . still , mr . lay suffered huge paper losses this year . at the end of 2000 , he had 5 . 1 million options that could have been exercised for profits of $ 257 . 5 million , and another 1 . 5 million options that would have been worth another $ 104 . 1 million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised - - assuming the share price stayed level . he exercised 565 , 928 of those options this year , making a profit of $ 20 . 7 million , but the ones he did not exercise are now under water . photo : kenneth l . lay , the chief executive of enron , decided to give up his severance of more than $ 60 million after complaints from employees .

" we don ' t have any track record here , " said ernest gellhorn , an antitrust expert at george mason university . the deal will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , but the most critical approvals will come from the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) and us antitrust agencies . central to the antitrust review will be how competition authorities define the market - how big it is , which companies are included as competitors , and how the market share is divided up . former antitrust officials said enron might be forced to resort to a " failing firm " defence , which is occasionally used by companies with large market shares when attempting to add to their dominant position . but robert mctamaney , an antitrust partner at carter ledyard & milburn , said the failing - firm route may be difficult for dynegy and enron to prove , since it requires a showing that without the merger , enron ' s trading business would exit the market completely . helping the companies , however , is the relative ease with which competitors can enter the trading market , experts said . an analysis of barriers will hinge on whether rivals can successfully argue that the level of expertise in the industry is so sophisticated - or that enron ' s trading technologies are so specialised - that it would be impossible for new entrants to duplicate the company ' s operations . dynegy executives said they expect more scrutiny from ferc , though it rarely rejects mergers , and its guidelines put an emphasis on speed of reviews .

" ken lay will not accept the dollars 60 m when he leaves , " an enron spokeswoman said . " he felt like it was not the right thing to do . " according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission , mr lay is entitled to dollars 20 . 2 m in cash for every remaining year in his employment contract if he leaves enron within 60 days of the company being taken over . mr lay ' s decision is in sharp contrast to other senior us executives who have negotiated - and accepted - " golden parachutes " which guarantee them large payments even if they oversaw large - scale destruction in shareholder value . mr lay had previously come under fire from shareholders for selling some of his enron shareholding before the collapse in the company ' s stock price . between january and july this year , he sold enron shares with an estimated value of more than dollars 27 . 5 m . at the close of trading yesterday enron was valued at dollars 7 . 5 bn , compared with a peak of dollars 65 . 9 bn in august last year . the terms were part of mr lay ' s original employment contract , which had been due to expire in december 2003 . but in august , following the sudden departure of chief executive jeff skilling , enron ' s board extended mr lay ' s contract by two years . at the time , the contract extension was seen as an attempt by mr lay to restore investor confidence in the company . but it also ensured he would receive an additional dollars 40 . 4 m if he left following a sale . after the dollars 10 . 8 bn dynegy takeover , mr lay is expected to give up his executive responsibilities . he may join the combined group ' s board of directors but this will not affect his eligibility for a pay - off . the deal , which requires the approval of us competition authorities , is expected to be completed next year . copyright : the financial times limited 1995 - 1998 business ; financial desk enron chief relinquishes severance pay jerry hirsch times staff writer 11 / 14 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . chief executive kenneth l . lay on tuesday waived a severance payment of at least $ 60 million due him when dynegy inc . completes its expected acquisition of enron next year , company officials said . the potential payment , disclosed in a securities and exchange commission regulatory filing tuesday , would undoubtedly have sparked additional controversy , given lay ' s primary role in the sharp fall of enron ' s stock and worsening financial condition , which led to the dynegy deal . the payment would have been one of the biggest rewards for failure in corporate history , said graef crystal , a leading compensation expert . the payment would have topped the nearly $ 40 million mattel inc . paid former chief executive jill barad after she was ousted in 2000 after spending $ 3 . 6 billion to purchase a money - losing software business the company eventually gave away to a technology group in return for a slice of future profit . it would have been almost double the $ 35 million in severance collected by former xerox corp . chief executive richard thoman when he was fired in may 2000 after a disastrous reorganization of the copier company ' s sales force . according to enron spokeswoman karen denne , lay spoke to a number of employees tuesday and " decided that the best course of action would be for him to waive his right to payment . " " instead , " denne said , " the combined company would decide the best use of those funds . " lay and enron have run into a storm of criticism in recent weeks after the disclosure of a series of partnerships and the dismissal of several top executives who invested in those ventures . news of the partnerships and their losses forced the houston - based company to restate its earnings last week , reducing corporate profits over the last four years by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . shareholders have filed a series of lawsuits against enron , charging the company with failing to disclose key information about its operations and financial structure . the negative disclosures sparked a cash crunch and threatened enron with collapse until it was saved by an agreement friday to be acquired by houston - based dynegy for $ 9 billion . shareholders have watched the value of enron shares decline almost 90 % from a high of nearly $ 90 on aug . 23 , 2000 . its shares closed tuesday at $ 9 . 98 , up 74 cents , on the new york stock exchange . ceo already reaped $ 150 million in options according to the regulatory filing , lay stood to collect $ 20 . 2 million a year , plus certain extraordinary tax expenses , for each of the full years remaining on his contract once the company was acquired . if the dynegy deal is completed as expected next year , lay ' s payment would have totaled at least $ 60 . 6 million . his contract ends on dec . 31 , 2005 . lay already reaped about $ 150 million in stock option gains the last two years alone . those gains were in part made possible by rosy enron profit statements , which the company restated downward last week , crystal said . " it is a good move to waive the payment , " crystal said . " but that ' s just the down payment on what he should give back . there is probably another $ 100 million in option profits he should give back . had they correctly stated the books , the stock would not have risen as high and he would not have made as much from exercising his stock options in the company . " a stock option gives the holder the right to purchase a share of a company at a predetermined price . options are a common executive pay incentive , allowing the individual to purchase and sell the shares , pocketing the gains in their appreciation . lay made $ 123 million off such transactions last year and $ 26 million this year , crystal said . lay since 1989 has had a " change of control " clause that awards him a special payment if enron changes hands . the company described the clause as a standard part of executive employment agreements common to many companies . some wall street analysts said the liability for the payment would be dynegy ' s problem at the point the merger is completed . enron shareholders already have suffered all the damage they are going to see . " enron has clearly lost the vast majority of its shareholders over the last six months with its piecemeal disclosure , destruction of shareholder value and loss of credibility , " said andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york . john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said the company was aware of the severance clause and had factored the expense into its acquisition , which " we believe is a very strong financial transaction " regardless of the potential payment to lay . photo : enron ceo kenneth lay has run into a storm of criticism recently . ; ; photographer : associated press copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial enron ceo says no to $ 60 . 6 million peter behr washington post staff writer 11 / 14 / 2001 the washington post final eol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved kenneth lay , chairman and chief executive of enron corp . , decided yesterday to forgo an expected $ 60 . 6 million severance payment because of the impact of enron ' s plunging stock price on the company ' s employees , a spokesman said . until yesterday , lay was preparing to accept the severance payout , which would be triggered at the completion of enron ' s purchase by rival houston energy company dynegy inc . , a deal announced on friday . enron faced a cash crisis after disclosing it has overstated its earnings by $ 586 million over the past four years because of improper accounting treatment of its investments in outside partnerships that were managed by its chief financial officer . the severance package was reported yesterday by bloomberg news , which included a blistering comment by andrew whalley , manager of a trust that sold $ 5 million in enron stock in april because of concerns with enron ' s financial reports , bloomberg said . whalley called the settlement " a ridiculous amount of money " to pay the chairman of a company that suffered " a textbook financial collapse , where he obviously had some knowledge of what was going on . " enron spokesman karen denne said around midafternoon yesterday that lay intended to donate one - third of the severance to enron employees , keep one - third and use the remainder to pay taxes on the entire package . lay , who built enron into the world ' s largest energy trading company , was entitled to a payment of $ 20 . 2 million multiplied by each year remaining on his employment contract if it was terminated before it expires at the end of 2005 . the purchase by dynegy is expected to close in 2002 , assuming regulatory approvals are forthcoming , giving lay three years of payments . lay said last week that he will retire once the deal is done . denne checked again with lay later in the afternoon and was told that he had decided not to accept any of the severance payment after a meeting yesterday with enron employees . " he realized this was extremely sensitive given the financial condition of enron employees , " denne said . many enron employees hold the company ' s stock in savings and retirement plans , and the stock price has fallen from a high of $ 90 a share in august 2000 to a low of $ 8 . 41 last thursday . enron ' s price has picked up since the purchase announcement , closing at $ 9 . 98 yesterday . dynegy has agreed to pay $ 23 billion for enron , about $ 10 billion of that in stock ( about $ 10 a share , when the deal was announced ) , while assuming enron debt for the rest . lay ' s compensation was increased nearly threefold , to $ 18 . 3 million , last year , when the company ' s annual revenue reached $ 100 billion and its stock hit an all - time high . lay realized a gain of $ 123 . 4 million from exercising stock options last year . he is entitled to purchase 782 , 830 shares of enron stock over the next seven years through stock options , according to a company filing , but those grants currently are worthless because of the collapse of enron ' s stock price . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s lay sells shareholdings in other companies , wsj reports 2001 - 11 - 14 05 : 53 ( new york ) houston , nov . 14 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay has been selling shares of companies of which he is a board member , the wall street journal said . lay sold about $ 1 . 2 million , or more than 25 percent of his interest , in compaq computer corp . , where he has been a director for 14 years , the paper reported . he also sold 16 percent of his stake , or about 10 , 000 shares , in drugmaker eli lilly mikhail gorbachev , former president of the soviet union ; and colin powell , u . s . secretary of state . however , greenspan declined the cash and crystal sculpture that accompany the prize . it ' s logical that greenspan talked about energy , considering the award is named for an energy trading company , the institute is researching energy supply and security issues , and the home of the institute is the world ' s energy capital . " as we , as economic policymakers , understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of sept . 11 and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events , it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long - term economic growth , " greenspan said . " one of the most important objectives of those policies should be an assured availability of energy . that imperative has , if anything , been elevated by the heightened tensions in the middle east - - an area that harbors two - thirds of the world ' s proven oil reserves . " greenspan reviewed the nation ' s experiences with seesawing energy prices and episodes of imbalances in supply and demand . he also discussed technologies to augment energy supplies , including coal mining , nuclear power and fusion power .

" after having discussions with employees today he decided that this is the right thing to do and he ' s going to leave it up to the combined company to determine the best use of that money , " denne told reuters . lay ' s contract , which runs through 2005 , calls for him to get $ 20 . 2 million for each full year left in his contract if enron is taken over by another company . enron and dynegy officials have said they expect to complete their merger by the third quarter of next year . denne said the clause , which is known in corporate circles as a " golden parachute , " has been in his contract since 1989 and is a " standard provision " for chief executives . denne said lay told enron employees of his decision in a company - wide e - mail . enron has been under the gun from wall street since mid - october when it said shareholder equity had been cut $ 1 . 2 billion because of off - the - balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . the u . s . securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into the transactions , which sent enron ' s stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit . on friday , enron and dynegy said they had agreed to merge at what seemed a firesale price for enron , which last year had $ 100 billion in revenues and $ 1 billion in earnings . also , on tuesday night , lay presented the enron prize for distinguished public service to federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in an event at rice university in houston . previous winners have included the likes of nelson mandela and mikhail gorbachev . prior to accepting the award , greenspan told students that the most important thing for anyone in the business world was to be ethical . " i don ' t deny that there is an extraordinary amount of activity in the business community which is less than exemplary . . . but the best chance you have of making a big success in this world is to decide from square one that you ' re going to do it ethically , " he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron chairman lay decides to forgo $ 60 . 6 million severance payment 11 / 14 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . said its chairman , kenneth lay , has decided to forgo a severance payment of $ 60 . 6 million that could be triggered by dynegy inc .

" he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . " the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day . the initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . " things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , " mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director . for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation . enron ( ene ) , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy ( dyn ) for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies . separately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board " failed in its responsibility " to monitor the activities of enron executives . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron chairman says he won ' t take dlrs 60 million compensation package if dynegy deal closes by kristen hays associated press writer 11 / 14 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - enron corp . chairman ken lay turned down up to dlrs 60 . 6 million that he stood to receive once the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas is merged into its smaller , but stronger rival dynegy inc .

" this is ridiculous after what has happened , " said donald coxe , who manages the harris insight equity fund , which at the end of last month owned about 78 , 000 shares of enron . " the idea that there would be a golden parachute for somebody who as a parachute captain sent his stockholders out of the plane without a parachute strikes me as pretty odd . " even before tuesday , lay had other ideas for the severance . early last week , palmer said lay proposed to chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , that he get two - thirds of what he was due in a noncash payment , such as stock in the merged company . with half of the noncash payment , lay wanted to set up a foundation to provide assistance to enron employees in need . a significant portion of the rest , according to his plan , would have been cash to cover taxes . dynegy declined immediate comment about lay ' s tuesday decision . but carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , quipped : " that might stave off one shareholder lawsuit .

its probably not worked out because of what enron considers a fair discount on what it has sunk into the project . prospective buyers consider this too high an asking price . for the record , enron claims to have sunk in $ 1 . 2 billion in the project together with its partners ge and bechtel who have supplied equipment and helped construct the plant . but my gentleman friend in pin - stripes suggests that $ 1 . 2 billion isnt exactly their equity contribution in dabhol . that amount works out to just about $ 800 million . enron , actually splurged close to $ 200 million on development expenses , which in gentlemens lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have ended up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides fighting sundry court cases in india . and it wants part of that money back . now which prospective buyer will compensate enron for possible bribes or for making court appearances ? enron , it appears , has also claimed another $ 140 million as its share of dabhols retained earnings , which should eventually go to all stake - holders in dpc ( the mseb included ) once the companys board passes a resolution that the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in dabhols equity capital . till then , leave the retained earnings aside . so , what enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in the project , which is no more than $ 800 million . now given its willingness to take a 30 per cent knock , enron should not expect more than $ 560 million as the asking price for walking out of dabhol . add to that , if you will , another $ 140 million by way of retained earnings and enron should not be getting more than $ 700 million at the most . is enron willing to take this knock ? given a choice , it could resist this offer . but enron has no choice . and thats reason for cheer . last week , enron , close to the present american dispensation ( chairman ken lay was the biggest fund - raiser for president george bushs campaign effort last year ) opted for a $ 7 . 8 billion rescue offer from smaller houston rival dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut to junk status . for the past several months enron had been using its clout with mr bush to push through a bail - out package on dabhol that suited its terms . that privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a securities exchange commission inquiry into off - balancesheet transactions . and until enron clears several questions back home about its finances , it will remain suspect in the eyes of us investors . in india , where enrons made more news for its misses than its hits , the timing couldnt have been more opportune than now for prospective private bidders to strike a potentially lucrative deal . two such bidders , tata power and bses , are said to have offered no more than $ 400 million to buy out enrons stake in dpc . its time they stuck to that price . or else , we could still end up being suckers . what ?

" ken put two pipelines together to make that company . i had six people and a smile , " watson told me during the chicago stop of an east coast - to - texas barnstorming to sell the deal to investors . enron was always the bigger glamor play . lay ' s move from a base of trading natural gas and electric power into the engineering of exotic financial deals in areas as diverse as communications bandwidth , paper , steel and media won a huge wall street following and doubled enron ' s stock price last year , to above $ 80 a share . dynegy by contrast seemed downright dull . though it dabbled in broadband communications , dynegy stuck mainly to the business of generating , trading and delivering gas and electricity . though dynegy ' s stock price nearly quadrupled last year to $ 59 , dynegy never turned heads the way enron did . today , enron has no friends left . the messy breakdown of enron ' s trades with outside partnerships has forced it into dynegy ' s embrace . watson thinks wall street went hard on enron because of the company ' s high - handed manner when it was on top . " if you have that personality and things go wrong , i mean , everybody ' s going to take your legs off , " watson says . this would be a tidy tortoise - and - hare tale except for one thing : enron ' s problems are such a mess , they could make for rough going at dynegy , too . watson thinks he has protected himself . he can walk from the deal if enron ' s legal entanglements exceed $ 3 . 5 billion . if , on the other hand , enron ' s problems don ' t get worse and other bidders emerge , he gets a healthy $ 350 million break - up fee and ownership of a key enron pipeline . that ' s better than nothing . but it ' s hardly a failsafe . some enron trades with the outside partnerships don ' t unwind for years , so problems might not emerge until after dynegy has closed its deal . there are more mainstream challenges , too . roughly half of enron ' s operating profits last year came from off - balance sheet transactions watson wants to eliminate . replacing that won ' t be easy . and watson needs to handle at least $ 14 billion in enron debt . enron ' s high rollers might not fit into dynegy ' s careful culture . watson ' s team also must stretch to run a company that , even with divestitures , will jump to at least three times dynegy ' s current size . watson ' s personality can be aw - shucks disarming . born at great lakes naval air station in illinois , the son of a navy officer , he lived in 22 places before he graduated high school . now , if he closes the deal , he ' ll be running one of the country ' s largest companies . no one would get a kick from taking watson down a notch . but that hardly means investors won ' t knock him if he can ' t make the enron deal work . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ceo says enron errors not illegal melita marie garza , tribune staff reporter 11 / 14 / 2001 chicago tribune north sports final ; n 1 ( copyright 2001 by the chicago tribune ) the downfall of energy - trading titan enron corp . was the result of " bad business practices " rather than illegal activity , says chuck watson , chief executive of dynegy inc . , the company acquiring enron in a deal valued at $ 24 billion . " i ' m not persuaded that you ' ll find anything illegal , " watson said tuesday , commenting on the securities and exchange commission ' s probe into enron ' s off - balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships . watson ' s comments came as enron , in a filing with the sec , disclosed that kenneth lay , the company ' s chairman and chief executive , could walk away with a golden parachute worth more than $ 80 million if the merger succeeds . under terms of a pre - existing employment contract , lay would receive $ 20 . 2 million a year for each full year outstanding on his contract if control of enron changes hands during his employment . at the same time , enron issued a letter to employees warning that the deal with dynegy was likely to result in workforce reductions at enron . " as with any merger , " the letter said , " some elimination of positions is almost inevitable . " enron , the nation ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , has seen its stock price collapse in recent weeks largely because of soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and additional revelations about questionable accounting practices at enron . power - trading rival dynegy , owner of downstate utility illinois power , moved last week to acquire its hobbled competitor , agreeing to pay the equivalent of about $ 10 a share for a company that as recently as last january traded above $ 80 a share . in a wide - ranging interview , watson criticized the practice at dynegy of permitting enron executives to sit on the partnership boards and profit from them . " you don ' t let that happen , " watson said . " it would never have gotten by me . " watson sees the distinction between illegal conduct and bad judgment at enron as significant because the absence of illegality would minimize grounds for shareholder lawsuits . dynegy has said the merger is contingent on litigation costs over enron ' s problems staying under $ 3 . 5 billion . " i don ' t think it ' s going to be anywhere near that level , " watson said . enron ' s misfortunes , watson said , paved the way for dynegy ' s opportunity . " this is all about brand , " he said . " they lost credibility and investor confidence . " dynegy ' s takeover of its higher - profile rival is a coup for dynegy , which has been viewed by some as an " enron wannabe . " but watson brushed off the description . " that ' s actually not true , " watson said . " it ' s clearly not true now . " watson asserted that nothing had gone wrong with enron ' s core businesses . that fact , he said , had been lost - - by investors and potential enron suitors - - in the controversy surrounding the off - balance sheet transactions . " maybe the tires fell off the car and the paint was chipped , but the engine was still strong , " watson said , referring to enron ' s core businesses . in an apparent conundrum , dynegy ' s bid for enron at what is viewed as a bargain basement price has not brought any other companies to the bargaining table . enron ' s problems reportedly scared off some prospective bidders , such as warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway . watson argued that dynegy was uniquely positioned to pursue the enron deal , in large part because the rivals had extensive business dealings together . " it took our guys days - - not months - - to do due diligence , " watson said . " we were right there in town . it was the time factor , the knowledge that we had of the industry and the business . " for example , watson said shell oil co . , another company thought to have an interest in acquiring enron , would not have had the background to move as quickly as dynegy had in putting together the merger . while saying that he had respect for the regulatory approval process , watson reiterated his belief that the merger posed no antitrust concerns . " we don ' t have a pipeline business , they do , " watson said . " they don ' t have a generation business , we do .

" it ' s safe to say that absent a dynegy deal , enron was quite likely to end up non - investment - grade quality because of what had happened , " shipman said . enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off - balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest . s & p lowered its long - term corporate credit rating on enron to bbb - minus from bbb , its lowest investment - grade rating . a cut below that , to junk , would make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business . the rating agency also placed the ratings of dynegy on creditwatch negative after the energy provider said it had agreed to acquire enron for about $ 9 . 5 billion . terms of the dynegy transaction call for dynegy to swap 0 . 2685 shares of its own stock for each enron share , the companies said . that would value houston - based enron at $ 10 . 41 per share , including convertible stock , a premium of about 21 percent over friday ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 . the takeover announcement halted a free - fall in enron ' s stock , which has lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month . on tuesday , , enron shares closed at $ 9 . 99 , up $ 0 . 75 cents , or 8 . 12 percent , on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s debt , which has been trading at levels associated with higher - risk junk bonds , moved higher on the news . the company ' s 7 . 875 percent notes due 2003 were traded at 92 cents on the dollar , up from the mid - 80 ' s range last week , traders said . industry experts said the most critical component of the deal was an immediate cash infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron . chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , has agreed to infuse $ 1 . 5 billion immediately into enron to support it until the deal closes . it would inject another $ 1 billion into the merged company once the deal closes .

' ' the patriot funds don ' t own shares of enron or dynegy . lay has been chairman since february 1986 . his contract was extended by two years , to the end of 2005 , when he resumed the ceo ' s job following the departure of jeffrey skilling in august . skilling didn ' t get a severance package because he quit , enron has said . the company more than tripled lay ' s pay package last year to $ 18 . 3 million following its best share - price performance in 20 years , according to a proxy filed in march with the sec . enron shares have plunged 90 percent this year . lay made $ 5 . 97 million in 1999 , according to enron ' s proxy . lay also received options to buy 782 , 830 shares over seven years , most at $ 47 . 31 each , the march filing said . those options are now worthless because enron ' s stock price is below the price at which they could be exercised . shares of enron rose 74 cents to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy rose $ 2 . 63 to $ 46 . 94 . both companies are based in houston . - - margot habiby in dallas , ( 214 ) 954 - 9452 switzerland : swiss ewz suspends planned power venture with enron . 11 / 14 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . zurich , nov 14 ( reuters ) - swiss utility elektrizitaetswerk der stadt zuerich ( ewz ) has suspended its planned power trading joint venture with enron corp that was supposed to start up in january , ewz said on wednesday . enron , hit by financial problems , is on the verge of being taken over by smaller rival dynergy inc , which agreed last week to buy enron in a stock swap worth about $ 9 billion .

( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar distribution group , inc . " vdg , " forming a revolutionary new music company , controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a 33 % stake in the new company . roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder approval immediately thereafter . pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , " this alliance will allow pop 3 to achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . " roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry today . " it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , " stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo . " additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our artists . " mr . shebanow concluded , " while there are smaller labels that do provide a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

" read the following . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless , and fun way to make some extra money at home . and , besides even if you never got involved in the program , the reports themselves are well worth the money . they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet . that is , these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet . the results of this show have been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it . " here it is below " * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment ( $ 25 ) and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave your house except to get the mail . simply follow the instructions , and you really can make this happen . this e - mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non - commercialized method of advertising now ! the longer you wait , the more savvy people will be taking your business using e - mail . get what is rightfully yours . program yourself for success and dare to think big . it sounds corny , but it ' s true . you ' ll never make it big if you don ' t have this belief system in place . multi - level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi - level methods . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience , started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead - panned his response . " that ' s why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! " with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided " why not . " initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip - off " anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . here is the basic version of what you need to do : your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do . your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2 within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off , keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build . keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it wasn ' t working . finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to " move up " or " get rich " . inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! " think about it . " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say " no way ! " please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps " a " through ' g " or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 . d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy and paste method works well , . 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of participants . think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number , and name * * * * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of those sheets of paper include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e - mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider encounters problems ) . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 " the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the internet " order report # 1 from : randy dillard p . o . box 8 osprey , fl 34229 usa report # 2 " the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the internet " order report # 2 from : carla brown p . o . box 39093 sarasota , fl 34238 usa report # 3 " the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet " order report # 3 from : glynn schmidt p . o . box 19424 sarasota , fl 34276 usa report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet " order report # 4 from : christin joy cpo 2398 501 e . college avenue wheaton , il 60187 usa report # 5 " how to send one million e - mails for free .

appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron . the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n . america . we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third

( started 21 years ago . ) it is one of those companies you ? ve never heard of ? doing things you never knew existed . in this case , spsc creates highly sophisticated software products for the department of defense ? manufactures specialized military items ? does airspace and airport planning ? and operates bombing ranges . ( you never knew that business existed , did you ? ! ! ) among other facilities around the country , this company all by itself runs the world ? s second - largest live - fire training range for combat pilots . ( under contract with the u . s . air force . ) this is the huge 2 . 5 million acre barry m . goldwater range in southwestern arizona ? where pilots come to improve their air - to - ground combat skills and practice with live bombs , rockets , missiles and cannon fire . ( most combat pilots who served in the first and second gulf wars were trained at this spsc - operated base . pilots from over a dozen foreign countries also train here . ) but spsc ? s global reputation lies in its proprietary saferange technology , which makes the company a leader in weapons training , used by over 80 organizations around the world . this was developed by spsc ? s founder and chairman , donal myrick , and forms the basis for the revolutionary safeborders technology . virgin industry  virgin investment how often have you been present at the birth of an entirely new industry that reflects some overwhelming urgent need ? ? urgent ? ? hell , yes ! what ? s more urgent than our immediate survival ? ! ! that being the case , no matter what happens to the economy , you can be sure this overwhelming need will stay constant . and while nothing is guaranteed , it could also make a pretty good investment . border protection truly represents a universal need ? the threat from terrorism is growing , no matter how well things go in iraq . weapons of mass destruction are getting easier to acquire on the black market , and increasingly less complicated to activate . the need for border protection has reached universal acceptance . the public understands the need for safe borders , and supports massive government funding . the growth of this virgin industry is soaring , in part because of the federal government ? s heavy spending . it ? s hard to see how the border protection industry will decline over the coming years . on the other hand , if we ? re hit by some new major act of terrorism , it will probably accelerate further . mass panic would demand even more border protection . that ? s a realistic view of the industry , but what about individual companies within the border protection industry ? how will they do ? in fact , over the near - term , it would be fairly hard for a company not to do well ? though be careful of quickie start - ups seeking to capitalize on these opportunities .

2	Subject: fw : status of cpuc proposed decisions on direct access suspension there was a discussion on this morning ' s call regarding the status of puc actions regarding da suspension . we requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel . it is attached . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to contact sue mara ( 415 . 782 . 7802 ) or me ( 415 . 782 . 7822 ) . best , jeff - - - - - original message - - - - - from : mday [ mailto : mday @ gmssr . com ] sent : monday , september 17 , 2001 12 : 45 pm to : ' jeff dasovich enron sf ' cc : ' sue mara at enron sf ' subject : status of cpuc proposed decisions on direct access suspension jeff : at your request i am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda items before the cpuc on the issue of suspension of the direct access program . there are two pending draft decisions at this time , the first is the proposed decision of alj barnett ( item h - 7 on the last agenda ) which was modified by a changed version submitted by pres . lynch at 2 : 45 pm on 9 - 5 - 01 , the day before the last meeting . this version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order ( which would have been sept . 6 ) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective sept . 6 , 2001 , specifically naming that date . this order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of sept . 6 if it had been voted out that day . the other item , agenda item h - 7 a on the last agenda , is the bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds , and does not suspend direct access at this time . please be advised that the suspension date contained in h - 7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the cpuc meeting on sept . 20 . either the sept 6 date will be changed to the 20 th of sept . , or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date . all that is required to make this change is the distribution of a changed page on the escutia table before the commission meeting . thus , it is important for all direct access supporters to continue to urge the commission , especially commissioner brown , to support a suspension date later than sept . 6 , because it is so easy for the date to be altered under commission procedures . please let me know if you require any additional information on this subject . mike day goodin , macbride , squeri , ritchie & day

2	Subject: pulse survey results thank you for your participation in the pulse survey this past october . we achieved our highest response rate ever , with more than 1 , 400 ets employees ( 63 % ) participating in this important feedback process . the survey results , too , are very encouraging . most elements improved and ets  , strengths continue to be in the area of our employees , just as enron as a whole has been recognized by fortune magazine for our employees and management . ets received high marks from employees for the following areas :  people are treated with respect and dignity - 76 %  information from management is believable - 74 %  supervisors deal fairly with everyone - 72 %  teamwork is encouraged - 71 %  employee benefits are satisfying - 68 %  ets is well - managed - 66 % i am pleased with these results , because i believe they exhibit a strong belief in enron  , s core values , respect , integrity , communication and excellence . these results are indicative of the quality of ets employees at all levels . in this recent survey , just as in 1999 , workload was a concern , with 39 percent of survey participants saying they believed they did not have enough time to complete all of the work required of them . while we have made some strides at alleviating this concern as compared to the december , 1999 and june , 1999 surveys , i believe that we can do better still by shifting resources as business needs change , eliminating unnecessary work and more effectively using technology . i would also encourage you to consider the variety of training and development offerings available in the areas of workload planning and management . you also voiced concerns with communication across departments . i take your concerns very seriously and will ensure that ets focuses on further improvements in this area . a summary of what we heard from ets employees has been added to our intranet site . click on the following url to view our survey results : even beyond this survey , i continue to be interested in your thoughts on improving the ets organization . please feel free to send me your ideas via e - mail or interoffice mail . you can also send your ideas to gary smith , vice president of human resources or to any of the ets management team . the pulse enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee , so your continued participation is critical to its success . i hope you will choose to be a part of future surveys , the next of which is scheduled for the fall of 2001 . your input is essential in creating and shaping ets to be the best it can be . thank you again for participating in the 2000 pulse survey . stan horton

2	Subject: fw : ferc meeting summary the commission held its first open meeting with pat wood as the new chairman today and discussed many interesting issues . the following is a summary of the meeting . the meeting is still going on , and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon ( regarding market power ) . rtos chairman wood expressed his desire to finish the rto transition , and that the commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the rto transition . chairman wood considers the rto effort on two tracks : 1 ) organizational - - what will the rto organizations look like , and 2 ) substantive - - once you set up the organizations , what will they do . organizational effort : wood stated that this effort has already begun with the july 12 orders and the northeast and southeast mediation efforts . the commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast , southeast and midwest within the next couple of ferc meetings . wood also stated that it is time for rto west and desert star to " marry up , " meaning , i suppose , that the two should consolidate . wood does not think that california can be included in the western rto yet since it has lingering problems . structural effort : the commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in order no . 2000 into rto structures . to achieve this goal , the commission is establishing an " rto week " of advanced workshops , from october 15 - 19 , in advance of issuing a nopr , to address structural issues such as : congestion management ; cost recovery ; market monitoring ; transmission planning ; reliability ; transmission rights . wood also envisions that the commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing order no . 888 transmission tariff . the new tariff will apply to all public utilities and rtos . wood also recognized that some " sticks " are needed to entice rto participation . therefore , wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by december 15 , 2001 with a declaration to join an rto . if they do not make this declaration , these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis . furthermore , wood states that if entities do not join rtos , they should not be authorized to merge their facilities , and that ferc will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by rtos . wood states that these " sticks " provide incentive , but do not mandate , rto participation . with regard to the pending requests for rehearing , wood asked legal staff to figure out how " ferc can get there . " in other words , i think wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing . while commissioner breathitt is skeptical about some of these rto proposals , because she was not required to vote on anything today , she only expressed her concern . upcoming dates october 15 - 19 - - rto workshops end of october - - further orders on northeast , southeast , midwest rtos december 15 , 2001 - - all public utilities must commit to an rto or have their market based rates revoked proposed rule for standards of conduct within the next few days , ferc will be issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ( " nopr " ) on standards of conduct for transmission providers . as explained at the meeting ( we do not have a copy of the nopr yet ) , the nopr will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly . the nopr also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates , not just marketers . the standards of conduct would not apply to rtos and transmission providers who are members of an rto may ask for an exemption from the standards . the nopr will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission - owners ' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers . as you know , the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of tos that are only buying and selling power for native load customers . as the interim general counsel noted , these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the to . there was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load . staff told the commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules . pat wood said they will include the proposal in the nopr ( breathitt may not support ) , but if the industry does not support the proposal , ferc will pull it . we of course will strongly support the proposal . provision of adequate electrical capacity ( icap ) chairman wood asked staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements . wood noted that the commission had to issue an order on icap in new england during their recess in august , and he is not that familiar with the issues . therefore , he asked staff to prepare a presentation , which they made at the meeting this morning . the presentation will be made public within the next couple of days . in sum , staff seems to believe that some type of icap requirement is needed for reliability . after the presentation , wood noted that the new england icap order has enough wiggle room to allow the commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue . wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized , competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply ( without politically unacceptable , prolonged price spikes ) . commissioner brownell ( from the pennsylvania puc ) has a better understanding of icap and expressed concerns that icap may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers . realizing that there are many positions on this topic , chairman wood said he will publish the staff report and ask for comments by october 17 . we will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process . sorry this is so long , but a lot happened today . we will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over . let us know if you have any questions . sarah

( a complete list of ratings is available on ratingsdirect , standard & poor ' s on - line credit research service , or by calling the standard & poor ' s ratings desk at ( 1 ) 212 - 438 - 2400 . ) ratings for portland general electric co . remain on creditwatch with negative implications pending the announced acquisition of portland by northwest natural gas co . enron expects to use asset sales proceeds over the next year to restore its balance - sheet strength to a level that is consistent with the current ratings . the negative outlook acknowledges the potential for erosion of the company ' s credit quality as investor confidence in the company ' s management has waned and concerns have arisen about the possible long - term effects on their core marketing and trading business . standard & poor ' s is closely monitoring enron ' s capital needs and liquidity position , which are crucial to the continued success of its core business operations , and does not believe the company is threatened by liquidity concerns . enron will be challenged to economically convert its sizable portfolio of non - strategic assets into cash to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet . despite the negative outlook , several factors supportive of enron ' s credit quality have been sustained throughout the uncertainty surrounding the company . the fundamental strength of enron ' s energy marketing and trading franchise has remained steady . standard & poor ' s has detected no lapses in the company ' s risk management practices and trading discipline . no significant deterioration in trading volumes or willingness of counterparties to transact with enron has been revealed to standard & poor ' s in contacts with major energy market participants . moreover , the strategic direction of the company is likely to become more credit - positive in the wake of recent management changes . the prior emphasis on growth initiatives and the constant need for new capital to fund those initiatives have constrained credit quality , and if the company is led to concentrate on its core energy businesses and refrain from committing capital to more speculative ventures in the future , the credit profile will improve as the company proceeds with the strengthening of its financial position . assurances from the top levels of enron management that the company will maintain its commitment to its credit quality and that no steps are being taken to support the company ' s common stock price at the expense of credit quality provide further support for enron ' s ratings . outlook : negative the negative outlook for enron is based on the considerable challenges facing the company as it attempts to reduce balance - sheet leverage through asset dispositions in a timely manner . any shortfall in the company ' s willingness or ability to restore the balance sheet through sales proceeds and new equity issuances would result in a ratings downgrade . current ratings will be stabilized if the company can successfully reduce financial risk while maintaining the ability of its operations to produce sustainable cash flow and earnings without increasing its business risk . concerned energy cos make few changes in enron dealings by mark golden , kristen mcnamara , jon kamp and john edmiston of dow jones newswires 10 / 25 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com ( kristen mcnamara , jon kamp in chicago and john edmiston in houston contributed to this article . ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron woes fuel online energy trade jitters october 25 , 2001 04 : 31 pm et reuters by gelu sulugiuc new york , oct 25 ( reuters ) - enron corp . ' s ( ene . n ) almost daily revelations of fresh troubles has prompted concerns its powerful position in online energy trading could prompt a credit crunch and rock the fast - growing industry . though experts said on thursday that enrononline , enron ' s web trading platform , should survive , investors are skittish about the no . 1 u . s . natural gas and electricity marketer . since last week enron has shed more than $ 13 billion in market value as shares plunged , forcing it on wednesday to replace its chief financial officer , who was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators . in the latest blow , credit rating agency fitch on thursday placed enron debt securities on negative credit watch , saying the erosion of investor confidence , if unabated , would impair the company ' s access to capital markets " we put them on a list of concerns two months ago and made sure our books were balanced just as the first stage of precaution , " said one energy trader active on enrononline . about 60 percent of all transactions by enron are captured through enrononline , and so far traders have kept faith . on wednesday , enrononline - - in which trades always involve enron as either the buyer or seller - - conducted 8 , 000 transactions through its site , with a notional value of $ 4 billion , more than daily its average of $ 3 . 5 billion . " people are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios for the winter and to protect themselves from price volatility , " said vance meyer , an enron spokesman . runaway success not even enron itself anticipated the success of enrononline , which enjoys the highest volume of any platform in the cut - throat field of internet energy trade . initially , the company set a yearly trading volume target of $ 30 billion to 40 billion - - business it now does in 10 days alone . yet traders worry enron ' s spectacular fall from grace could make it a less solid counterparty in certain eyes after transactions with two limited parterships run by andrew fastow sparked investigations by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . enron replaced fastow as its cfe on wednesday in the hope it would restore investor confidence . enron shares closed down 6 cents , or 0 . 4 percent , to $ 16 . 35 on thursday . the stock has lost 80 percent so far this year . " i haven ' t seen any sign of them slowing down or not making a good market on enrononline , but until things get squared away , i will keep a tight leash on the credit issue , " one trader said . " the only thing that bothers me is it takes a lot of capital to do what they ' re doing , and with the stock price down , i wonder how much credit they have left , " he added . credit line enron said this week that it can tap a $ 3 . 35 billion credit line to support its trading and marketing business , which can experience wide swings in cash flow depending on commodity prices . " in the event of a ' push - comes - to - shove ' liquidity crunch , we believe the company could generate substantial cash by selling a variety of other assets , " said ron barone , an analyst at ubs warburg . if enrononline does lose steam , the big winner will be its main rival atlanta - based ( ice ) - - which already routinely trades more than $ 1 billion a day . " this ( recent news ) shows there may be some kinks in the armor and some people may stop using enrononline , " said kyle cooper , analyst at salomon smith barney . " clearly ice could benefit or any other alternative online platform . " enrononline is still a force to be reckoned with , experts said . " enron clearly will survive and enrononline will still remain a dominant force " in internet energy trading , said barone . nonetheless , traders are playing it safe . " credit is the main game nowadays , so as long as you ' re not exposed too greatly to any one entity , you live to play another day if something happens , " one trader said . reuters enron ' s trading partners say it ' s business as usual ( correct ) 2001 - 10 - 25 16 : 36 ( new york ) enron ' s trading partners say it ' s business as usual ( correct ) ( corrects enron ' s commercial paper total to $ 1 . 85 billion in 19 th paragraph . ) houston , oct . 25 ( bloomberg ) - - concerns enron corp . will run short on cash haven ' t prevented commodities traders from doing business with the largest energy broker , customers say . enron handles about 25 percent of u . s . power and natural - gas trading , said john kilduff , vice president of energy risk management for fimat usa . it ' s also a leader in complex derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of fluctuating commodities prices . so far , there are no signs that the houston - based energy trader , the world ' s largest , is doing less business , kilduff said . ` ` if they were unable to perform , it would be a major problem , ' ' kilduff said . ` ` it could get like long - term capital if things really broke down because the numbers are that big . ' ' long - term capital management , a private investment fund for the wealthy , incurred massive losses making bond trades during the 1998 russian currency crisis . the fund ' s portfolio plunged . more than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $ 3 . 6 billion to avoid a collapse . enron ' s credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at moody ' s investors service after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from the declining value of some soured business investments . cash upfront ? falling below investment grade would force enron to risk more upfront cash for its trades , trading partners said , and substantially raise the cost of borrowing for a company dependent on affordable credit . enron , based in houston , ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow yesterday , two days after the u . s . securities and exchange commission began asking questions about partnerships he ran that invested in company shares . those trades cost enron $ 35 million . enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week . they fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 today . the company also faces questions from investors about $ 3 . 3 billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed to buy and sell enron assets such as power plants . the affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to meet them by selling assets . enron doesn ' t know if the sales proceeds will cover the debt . the company would have to make good on any shortfall . needs cash daily enron trades electricity , natural gas , coal and other commodities worldwide , as well as complex financial instruments to hedge against price swings in the goods . ` ` as of now , enron is active in the markets , ' ' kilduff said . ` ` no one is cutting trading lines that i can see , or demanding different terms than before . ' ' companies that trade as heavily as enron require cash every day to settle positions , said kilduff , whose company swaps natural gas and other energy investments with enron . some days , fimat will bet that natural gas prices will fall , while enron bets that they will rise . natural gas usually does one or the other every day , and someone pays the difference . ` ` the liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor , ' ' kilduff said . ` ` someone is paying someone else every day . ' ' enron said on a conference call tuesday that it has enough money to operate normally , and can fall back on $ 3 . 4 billion in bank credit lines if necessary . it ' s determined to protect the credit rating , an enron spokesman said . little time to pacify market enron asked citicorp inc . on tuesday to arrange a $ 750 million loan to ensure it would have access to credit if its cut out of the money markets . based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long - term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above investment grade . fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s all rate the company ' s debt at investment grade . enron had about $ 1 . 85 billion of commercial paper , or short - term unsecured debt , outstanding as of tuesday , traders said . the company , which has a $ 3 billion program , has had difficulty finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the sec investigation was announced , the traders said . today , enron offered two - week commercial paper at a 3 percent yield , 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies . ` ` there appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough time to get their house in order , ' ' said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy credit analyst at raymond james romesh wadhwani , vice - chairman and greg brady , ceo ; from i 2 ; sandeep tungare , chairman and ceo of vistaar ; robert crandall , former chairman and ceo , amr corporation / american airlines ; and harvey b . cash , general partner , interwest partners . about i 2 for more than a decade , i 2 has been a leader in supply chain management . i 2 has extended its technology and expertise to dynamic value chain management - - solutions to help companies collaborate on decision - making processes not only across functions within a single company , but across multiple companies . i 2 solutions span the value chain interactions , including customer relationship management , supply chain management and supplier relationship management . established in 1988 , i 2 is the only software solutions provider that measures , audits , and reports total value provided to its customers , with a mission to deliver $ 75 billion in value by 2005 . learn more at www . i 2 . com . i 2 is a registered trademark of i 2 technologies , inc . and its subsidiaries . contact : i 2 technologies , inc . brent anderson , 469 / 357 - 7347 brent _ anderson @ i 2 . com 16 : 07 edt october 25 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones lay resigns from i 2 board cbsmarketwatch . com , 10 / 25 / 01 new york ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron finished lower for the 7 th straight session thursday , one day after the energy merchant replaced its chief financial officer in a move the company said should help restore shareholder confidence . on thursday , fitch placed enron ' s securities on watch for a potential downgrade . the company ' s credit is already under review by moody ' s investors service . also thursday , chief executive ken lay resigned from the board at i 2 technologies , citing increasing responsibilities at enron . enron , which traded as high as $ 17 . 95 during the session , closed at $ 16 . 35 , down 6 cents , after 39 million shares changed hands . on wednesday , a day after issuing a public vote of confidence in cfo andy fastow , enron chief executive ken lay ousted him in the latest in a two - week series of events that have cut the company ' s share price by more than half . enron named jeff mcmahon its new chief financial officer . the move follows tuesday ' s conference call , a failed attempt by enron to restore investor confidence in the company . " andy fastow was a very well - regarded , low profile individual at enron , and he ' s been unfairly pilloried in the press , " said john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston . " but the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable . " olson predicted wednesday that the cfo swap would improve enron ' s credibility with wall street . fastow could not immediately be reached for comment . analysts unsatisfied enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices , especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by fastow in 1999 and since dissolved . " fastow was integral to the transactions that are currently under scrutiny . . . as such , his ' leave of absence ' raises more questions than it answers , " banc of america securities ' analyst will maze told clients thursday . enron said fastow had taken a leave of absence and that mcmahon , most recently chairman and ceo of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000 , would take over . " in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , " said lay , in a statement . karen denne , a spokesperson for enron , said numerous discussions tuesday and wednesday led to the decision . she said she did not know when fastow would return . " the management change was designed to instill some badly needed investor confidence , however , we find fastow ' s departure unsettling given management ' s strong endorsement one day prior , " maze noted . he downgraded the stock thursday to " market performer " from " strong buy . " morningstar analyst rob plaza said using fastow as a scapegoat does nothing to address the issues at enron . " enron needs to be more forthcoming with its off - balance - sheet deals and transparent with its financial statements in order to answer its critics , " plaza said . more criticism olson called tuesday ' s conference call a " missed opportunity , " saying enron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more " forthright and open . " " unfortunately enron is overloaded with lawyers , " said olson , who has not recommended the stock until recently . " this company has been very much abused and maligned by people on wall street . they have some excellent businesses , and they have been carrying some losers . " enron has " an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses , and excellent surplus cash flow , " olson said . enron expects to generate $ 3 billion of cash flow this year , and with $ 500 million devoted to dividends and $ 1 billion to maintenance capital spending , the company will have $ 1 . 5 billion free . several wall street firms cut their ratings on enron shares wednesday , including prudential securities . the firm advised clients to sell the stock , a rare recommendation . prudential had rated the company ' s shares a " hold . " " after much consideration , we are lowering our rating . . . not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don ' t know about the company , " wrote prudential analyst carol coale in a note . on monday , enron announced that related - party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the securities and exchange commission . several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed . olson said it ' s unlikely that enron , with its coterie of lawyers , would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles , but as to whether it the decision was " right , " he conceded it was probably not . ubs warburg ron barone on thursday raised the idea of enron as an acquisition target , if further deterioration is seen in the share price . enron would be a good catch for larger and better - capitalized companies that want to make inroads in the unregulated wholesale and retail energy markets , he said . enron ' s strength lies in those areas . fitch weighs in fitch said thursday it ' s reviewing the ratings on enron ' s debt , preferred stock and commercial paper . the agency also placed the debt of two enron subsidiaries on " rating watch negative . " fitch said its action is in response to enron ' s recent disclosures concerning the limited partnerships . " the loss of investor and counterparty confidence , if it continues , would impair enron ' s financial flexibility and access to capital markets , therefore , impacting its ability to conduct its business , " fitch wrote . fitch also voiced concern about two limited liability companies - marlin water trust ii and osprey - which have combined debt of $ 3 . 2 billion . " enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt , " fitch said . denne said the company plans to use proceeds from asset sales to pay off the debt . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . selective buying wipes out early losses by seth sutel ap business writer 10 / 25 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . new york ( ap ) - selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher thursday , reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports . shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well , as did energy traders , led by a surprisingly strong performance from williams cos . , a tulsa - based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in third quarter net earnings . by late afternoon , the dow jones industrial average was up 103 . 16 at 9 , 448 . 78 , reversing an earlier deficit of 167 points . the nasdaq composite index was up 36 . 29 at 1 , 767 . 83 and the standard & poor ' s 500 index was up 12 . 79 to 1 , 097 . 99 . earlier , a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month ' s terror attacks to send stocks lower . but as in recent sessions investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies . the williams cos . surpassed analysts ' estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full - year earnings for 2001 and 2002 . investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up $ 1 . 42 to $ 27 . 32 , bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it . even the shares of enron rose , a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company . enron was up 28 cents to $ 16 . 69 . semiconductor shares also rebounded , led by industry bellwether intel , up 44 cents at $ 25 . 92 and applied materials , up $ 1 . 35 at 36 . 69 . leading data storage maker emc was also up $ 1 . 06 at $ 13 . 54 . traders said that afternoon passage by the senate of an anti - terrorism legislation was also helping to lift investor sentiment . late wednesday , the house passed a $ 100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy . a surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning , as did poor earnings results from american international group and worldcom . the commerce department reported orders plunged in september for the fourth consecutive month . the 8 . 5 percent decline was far worse than the 1 . 3 percent dip many analysts had forecast . the labor department also reported that the number of newly laid - off americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8 , 000 last week to 504 , 000 , the second - highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally associated with recessions . the russell 2000 index , the barometer of smaller company stocks , rose 6 . 97 to 434 . 62 . advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 9 - to - 7 margin on the new york stock exchange , where volume came to 1 . 02 billion shares , slightly below wednesday ' s pace . overseas , japan ' s nikkei stock average ended the day up 0 . 7 percent . in afternoon trading , germany ' s dax index was down 2 . 9 percent , france ' s cac - 40 fell 2 . 4 percent percent , and britain ' s ft - se 100 declined 1 . 6 percent . - - - on the net : new york stock exchange : http : / / www . nyse . com nasdaq stock market : http : / / www . nasdaq . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones this after defending him over the past few days .

( graphic : enron ( ene ) 16 . 91 up . 50 ) but you ' ve got to start somewhere . the placing of the leave of absence of andy fastow is a step of the right direction . clearly he had lost his credibility personally . there ' s a lot of questions remaining relative to these partnerships ; how they were put in place and why . i don ' t see anything untoward in them from an accounting point of view . and i don ' t believe that the sec inquiry is going to come up with anything untoward because there ' s been extensive reporting about these partnerships over the last couple of years that they ' ve been in existence . the questions come up now because of the financial ramifications that you referred to before ; 3 . 3 billion dollars of asset value that to some degree is unaccounted for currently in terms of the assets that are in those partnerships . ultimately , we think this is going to be resolved , perhaps partially with the issuance of some equity that - - to the debt holders behind those partnerships . but once they get cleared up and the credibility is restored , this is a very attractive valuation with which to own enron . velshi : all right . curt , thanks very much for joining us today . launer : thank you . velshi : curt launer is a natural gas analyst at credit suisse first boston . fred katayama is our stocks editor . enron , our " stock of the day .

2	Subject: friday p & l i have just been informed that our p & l was overstated by approx $ 6 million on friday . since it is quarter end , we are re - calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result . the mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month ( may became june , june became july , july became aug , etc . ) . starting tommorow , harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for east power . the vol curve changes that harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk p & l ( 1 - 2 million ) . most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position , however , the new albany spread option loses a corresponding amount . the recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the portland risk group being down to 2 people ( total experience of 3 months ) and many of our resources are getting sucked into west issues . continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes . the $ 23 million of p & l for friday business can be reconciled as follows : $ 6 million from thursday mistake ( p & l understated on thursday because wednesday curves were used after port calc failed ) $ 10 million in " true " friday p & l ( summer 01 , cal 02 & cal 03 all down approx . $ 1 / mwh ) $ 6 million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves . the final p & l issued by 2 : 00 pm today ( for cob friday ) will be approx . $ 17 million .

" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

" although pjm also conducted a " best practices " analysis , the other isos and ny tos do not agree with pjm ' s determinations of what practices from their isos are " best practices . " the judge acknowledges that support for option 3 - m ( the pjm plan ) " far outstrips " the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support . however , the judge believes that the pjm option assumes the pjm platform can work in new york and new england , even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in new york and new england than in pjm . the judge states that " impatience , haste and greed " should not be permitted to drive the rto process " at the expense of sound policy " and that optimal rto benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to " exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint . " see report , page 18 . governance the other substantive issues we have discussed are governance : interim governance , final governance , board make - up and stakeholder process . the judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead , he discusses the pros and cons of each option . here again , the judge strongly urges the commission to provide guidance to the participants on the commission ' s preferred governance approach . the judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures . pjm has stated that in order to meet its deadline of november 2003 ( and certainly earlier ) , pjm has to be in control of the implementation of the new rto . pjm proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing isos : 5 from pjm , 3 from new york , and 2 from new england . the board elects a voting ceo ( assumed to be phil harris if the pjm proposal wins ) . ny iso , new england iso , ny psc , ny tos and new england tos , along with other entities ( primarily those who are afraid to cross new york psc ) all support equal representation on the new board . one proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with a non - voting ceo . the other proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders . we support the pjm board make - up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single northeast rto and energy market based on the pjm system . post mediation the judge in his report recommends that the commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge . the judge urges the commission to not accept comments from participants , but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment . we are working on two sets of comments now , one on our own and one in conjunction with the one rto coalition . we will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared . although we are disappointed that the judge did not endorse the pjm proposal , we still believe that the commission is intent on implementing a single northeast rto as soon as possible and that the pjm proposal provides a well - reasoned ( even conservative ) approach to reaching that goal . therefore , even though the judge sided with new york , we are hopeful that the commission will stick to its guns and go with the pjm proposal . please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the report . sarah , dan , howard and tom

2	Subject: dash for potential deal with nstar all : as some of you may be aware , we appear to be getting close to entering a transaction with nstar to serve its all - requirements power needs for its residential and commercial customer class default service obligations . the deal would be for a term of 6 or 12 months commencing july 1 , 2001 . nstar ' s service territory covers boston and surrounds , as well as south - eastern massachusetts . this prospective deal is very similar in nature to the standard offer service deals we have entered into with united illuminating , nstar , and most recently , central maine power . here is the status at this point : nstar achieved various levels of signoff for the basic deal structure ( both with regulators and internal senior management ) . nstar has indicated that it has basically come down to price and they could potentially pull the trigger as early as monday , but certainly within a couple of days at the most . nstar has requested updated pricing by 10 am eastern on monday 3 / 26 to be held firm through cob same day ( contingent upon execution of definitive agreements by that time ) . they are seeking pricing updates from competing suppliers so we are not exclusive at this point . nstar / enron have worked through our extensive markups on their proposed contract , and have compiled a list of outstanding contract issues . ( note : marcus nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal , and can be reached at 5 - 8161 to discuss contract issues ) . while the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point , my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours . in fact , they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for standard offer service , so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay , thereby potentially making execution on monday a possibility . attached is a draft dash for this deal . i request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid - afternoon on monday so as to enable us to transact on monday if necessary . the parameters that are still in motion are : ( 1 ) price ( again to e updated monday morning ) , but will maintain same npv value ; ( 2 ) term ( they may end up just going for 6 months ) ; and ( 3 ) exact volume they source from us . as for volume , they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than 100 % of their requirements for the first 6 months ( they estimate anywhere between 50 - 100 % ) , and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second 6 months if they do end up doing a 12 - month deal . please feel free to call me ( 978 - 449 - 9936 office , 978 - 448 - 9260 home over the weekend ) if you would like to discuss in more detail . berney aucoin in structuring will be on point to run internal traps on monday as may be necessary . thanks in advance . regards john

2	Subject: fw : the road to competitive electricity markets in mexico - - - - - original message - - - - - from : sandputil @ standardandpoors . com [ mailto : sandputil @ standardandpoors . com ] sent : thursday , december 20 , 2001 10 : 02 am to : rohauer , tanya subject : the road to competitive electricity markets in mexico standard and poor ' s ratingsdirect link this report was reproduced from standard & poor ' s web - based credit ratings and research service , ratingsdirect . click here to get a free 30 - day trial ! your connection to standard & poor ' s utilities , oil & gas , and project finance ratings team standard & poor ' s is pleased to provide ongoing service to the investment community . research : need for capital investment the push toward competitive electricity markets in mexico is driven by the need for investment in power generation and the reluctance of the mexican government to continue to add off - balance sheet debt in the form of the ipp contracts . mexico is forecast to require investments in the power sector of about $ 5 billion per year during the next 10 years to keep up with demand , most of which is expected to come from private investors . although the current economic conditions may adjust this forecast downward , substantial investment will still be required in the sector . even though the ipp program has been successful thus far , standard & poor ' s views these contracts as off - balance sheet debt of cfe , which puts negative pressure on cfe ' s credit rating . because the obligations under many of these contracts cross default with cfe ' s debt , which in turn cross defaults with some of the sovereign debt , these contracts also apply negative pressure to the sovereign rating . while this pressure is not substantial today , if the ipp program continues to be the sole source of new generation in mexico , these obligations will have a greater affect on the sovereign rating over time . therefore , a move to a fully competitive electricity market , where private investors take all of the financing risks , will alleviate credit pressure on the sovereign from the electric sector . in the interim , the comision reguladora de energia ( cre ) is working on creating a framework for the potential liberalization of the industry . cre envisions the creation of an independent system operator to manage generation commitment , dispatch , and billing . state - owned generators would be divided into regional entities to promote competition . the distribution sector would also be divided into several regional entities , and a concession for the operation and maintenance of these systems could be granted . the transmission network would remain as a single public entity , although concessions for new transmission projects could be granted . liberalization of the electricity sector during the past nine years , mexico has gradually liberalized the restrictions on the power market . cfe enjoyed a monopoly in the electric power sector for many years , although reforms instituted in 1992 allowed ipps to sell power to cfe and industrial customers under self - supply regulations . in 1996 , cfe devised a financing plan to meet projected electric demand growth . the objectives of the plan were to lower the company ' s debt leverage , finance projects at a lower cost , and extend the maturities of these obligations . as a result , for the first time , several new projects were structured as build - lease transfers ( blt ) , which are similar to lease transactions . under this structure , a third party finances and builds a plant ( or transmission line , or transformer ) and leases the plant to cfe for a period during which the investment is amortized . at the end of this timeframe , ownership of the asset is transferred to cfe . these blt arrangements indirectly assigned much of the operating risk to cfe , as cfe was required to pay for service even if the asset was unavailable . new facilities are now being constructed under ipp contracts . these arrangements are structured as take - and - pay power purchase agreements whereby cfe will not pay for power if it is not delivered . the next step would appear to be the creation of an open market system where participants are free to buy and sell electricity . yet , the outlook for the creation of such a system is unclear in mexico , given the highly politicized tripartisan environment that governs the decision - making process . ratingsdirect link is a free service provided by standard & poor ' s . if you do not wish to receive further e - mails related to this topic only , please send a blank e - mail to leave -

" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . " prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , " said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . " but all that is out the window now . " deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . " you will see some cancellations and some delays , " predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . " most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , " he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in " patient but not passive , " the story that accompanies the list , " by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . " fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , " chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview . earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years . future options for the broadband business include " sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities " he said . " we still think over time that it will be a valuable business , " lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a " total meltdown " , he added . enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters . enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations . enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 6 - enron posts loss after taking $ 1 bln in charges . by c . bryson hull 10 / 16 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , oct 16 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses . enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company . " what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , " chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call . lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm . houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 . the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago . " they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield , " said meade . enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period . ill - fated businesses originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity . the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled . enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets . enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential . enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 . debt on credit review rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent . the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 . all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year . the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility . the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations . in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) 2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york ) enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) ( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . ) houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion . the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million , or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion . investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news is out . ` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' ' said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' ' investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas - pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t confident enron was detailing all its problems . failed businesses the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the past four quarters . included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and international business machines corp . new power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies . the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be more specific . enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers . the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron said . enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than $ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill , lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' ' lay said . excluding losses minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier . shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 . ` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 . ` ridiculous investments ' at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses . enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water , from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million . in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier . revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million . ` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments . ' ' while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money . the company gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including coal , forest products and steel . ` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' ' hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and clear , and that the effort is there .

2	Subject: southwest power financing louise , i spoke to chip and he mentioned your concern / question about the financing of this project . to be clear , the turbines and some of the equipment are in turbopark . however , global finance does not want to construct this project inside of turbopark because accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments . global finance ' s plan is to provide a jedi ii / ena bridge loan to the project for the non - turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from may 1 through sep 30 . the expected loan amount during this time period is $ 30 mm , split between ena and jedi ii . our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at 15 % . global finance has committed to arrange non - recourse project financing so that ena / jedi will have only a $ 40 mm combined investment once the financing closes by sep 30 . also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to sep 30 . hopefully that clarifies things . regards , chris

( i . e . advanced excel skills . . . etc ) i ' d like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training before coming to your group . advanced excel skills , preferably a level of understanding of positions and value at risk . please compile this information and forward it to me so i can put it into some on - boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of rotations . the first candidates will begin on february 1 , 2001 . thank you very much for you time and consideration . tom wilbeck x 57536

2	Subject: blessings to you and your family compliments , i hope that this mail will not be an embarrassment to you . you have been recommended by an associate from our foreign trade council who assured me in confidence of your trustworthiness and faith in god . as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday i am mrs . maria al - qadhi , a merchant in kuwait ; i am married to sheikh salem al - qadhi who worked with kuwait embassy in dubai for eight years before he died in the year 2002 . we were married for eleven years without a child . since his death i decided not to re - marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer , which has defiled all forms of medical treatment . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . with all my wealth , i was never generous and was always hostile to people and only focusing on my business . but now i regret all this , as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . i have willed and given almost of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so i have decided to give also to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . presently , my health has deteriorated so badly , that i can no longer do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money , which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan ; they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contented with what i have left for them . the last of my money , which no one knows of , is the cash deposit of twelve million united states dollars ( us $ 12 , 000 , 000 . 000 ) deposited with a finance / security company abroad . since i have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that i might not be able to survive this illness from all indications , it is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of hiv / aids , charity organizations , orphans and needy widows in your country . my relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness and i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to them . bearing in mind that your assistance is needed in this regard , i propose a commission of 10 % of the above sum to you for this purpose . i will not be able to use the telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and the presence of my husband ' s relatives around me always . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of the finance / security company and also issue you a letter of authority to take over the deposit and disburse it accordingly on my behalf . please assure me that you will act as i stated herein . kindly send your reply enclosing your contact and email address to my private email address of mariaalqadhi @ volja . net , for confidentiality . mrs . maria al - qadhi mariaalqadhi @ volja . net

2	Subject: interesting article about enron in japan ' s electricity newspaper japan ' s electricity newspaper ( " denki shimbun " , the equivalent of megawatt daily ) has been running a series of articles about the new century . several of these have focused on the power industry in the u . s . a friend of mine ran across one on enron that was published on april 13 and sent it to me . i thought you would find it interesting . the article focuses on ees in particular and about how we try to succeed by being first to meet our clients ' changing needs . it also describes how we use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive . the article also briefly mentions the new office in japan . the most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is about enron . given what i have read and heard about how nervous the japanese are about deregulation of the industry , i really did not expect such praise . denki shimbun also has a web site at " www . shimbun . denki . or . jp " . they have small summaries of the important articles of the day ( the site , however , is completely in japanese ) . another interesting site is " www . criepi . denken . or . jp " , the english home site of japan ' s central research institute of electric power industry ( denryoku chuo kenkyuujou ) . the site has many links to other english - language sites related to the power industry in japan . regards , eugenio

" the shipping ministry has given its in - principle approval to sci for investing an extra $ 13 million in greenfield which will be in the form of a loan to the company and not as extra equity . the additional investment by sci would not require clearance from the union cabinet , " government sources told business line . though the additional investment of $ 55 million is to be shared equally by the three promoters of greenfield in proportion to their equity holdings , this proposition has gone awry due to the fact that one of the promoters , enron - affiliate atlantic commercial inc with a 20 per cent stake , has clearly said no to putting its share of extra funds . in fact , atlantic commercial inc . is understood to have expressed a desire to exit from greenfield by selling its equity worth $ 11 million and the swap cost of $ 19 million . consequently , the extra investment of atlantic commercial inc of $ 11 million is being shared by the other two partners - sci and japan ' s mitsui o . s . k . lines - apart from their own share of the additional cost in proportion to their equity holdings of 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively . so , sci will put in an additional $ 13 million comprising its share of $ 11 million and $ 2 million of atlantic commercial ' s share . whereas , mol will pump - in an additional $ 42 million including its share of $ 33 million and $ 9 million of atlantic ' s share . the additional investment by the promoters of greenfield shipping company has become necessary after the bankers to the lng shipping deal led by anz investment bank had suspended disbursement of the last tranche of the project loan of $ 55 million , citing an event of default . the additional investment made by sci and mol will take the form of a loan to greenfield which would enable the company to take possession of the lng tanker on the scheduled delivery date of november 15 . greenfield was formed for owning an operating a 137 , 000 cubic metre capacity tanker for transporting lng to enron - promoted dabhol power plant . the tanker is ready for delivery at the yard of mitsubishi , japan . the promoters are negotiating with oman lng to deploy the lng tanker ' lng laxmi ' till the lng terminal of dabhol goes on stream . p . manoj copyright ?

) . takeover speculation gave enron shares a boost wednesday , helping it end a 10 - day losing streak . but it ' s unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a securities and exchange commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers . for investors , a short - term rally beyond the jump wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares . but at a closing price of $ 13 . 90 , enron shares are more than a texas mile from their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 last december . for enron itself , it ' s time to put its cards on the table with regulators and wall street . as the drexel saga showed , a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end .

2	Subject: quick note louise : i just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e - mail . it seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation . basically all i want to tell you is that i ' m here to help in this process , and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular i can help on . i have spoken and offered the same directly to miller , calger and duran . i ' m not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow . as i think you know , the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term , and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen ( as evidenced by the $ 1 . 375 million doyle insurance settlement finalized today ) . i ' m approaching you and others specifically because i have 2 years of chapter 11 bankruptcy experience . prior to me joining enron in may of 1998 , i was with kenetech corporation ( a 1 , 200 employee publicly traded ipp ) . in 1996 ( after having worked as an originator at kenetech since 1990 ) , kenetech filed for chapter 11 . as part of the chapter 11 process , i was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the company to be responsible for liquidating the company ' s assets . as such , i am very familiar with the chapter 11 process , and how deals get done in this context . enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude , but i believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable . again , as we go through this process , i just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area , and let you know that i stand ready , willing and eager to take on additional tasks . with respect to our current deal flow , i also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which i will get to you by friday ( or earlier if need be ) : 1 . transaction list , status , and valuation ; 2 . site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy ; 3 . projected site bank maintenance budget . i will , of course , also provide this information to miller , calger and duran . best regards , ben

2	Subject: pg & e sues to recover uncollected costs pg & e sues to recover $ 3 billion exploring yet another legal avenue , pacific gas and electric co . wednesday filed in san francisco ' s federal district court asking for a judicial ruling that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $ 3 billion in uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since may when price spikes in califonia ' s market left the state ' s major investor - owned utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 levels . the utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved , therefore , it filed in federal court . earlier in the fall , pg & e appealed to the california supreme court , asking to overturn a california public utilities commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover its wholesale costs , which it passes on to customers without adding a profit charge . " we ' re just keeping our legal options open , " said a san francsco - based utility spokesperson , noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status , which was challenged tuesday when fitch placed it and another california utility on a " rating negative watch . " state and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing investigations that california ' s current wholesale electricity market is broken and noncompetitive in its current state , said roger peters , senior vice president and general counsel for pacific gas and electric . " however , there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers must have , either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair prices , or through retail rates . these costs are continuing to grow . " noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale charges , pg & e ' s utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the charges from its almost four million customers , and it reiterated five steps it has taken to " increase supply , moderate customer demand , repair the broken wholesale market and provide stable , reasonable rates .

2	Subject: urgent mr . kingsley mario lagos - nigeria . reply to : kingsleymario @ web - mail . com . ar attn : the managing director . dear sir , i know this will come to you as a surprise but never mind , i got your contact in my search for a reputable and trust worthy person / company , who can stand confidently with me in this successful business arrangement . before i proceed , i will like to introduce my humble self to you . i am , the auditor general of a government accredited oil company here in nigeria . certainly , the prompting of this letter to you is anchored on my strong desire to solicit your sincere understanding and co - operation in this transaction that would certainly boost the financial stand of both parties involved when completed . as a matter of fact , we want to transfer to overseas ( us $ 152 , 000 . 000 . 00 usd ) one hundred and fifty two million united states dollars ) from the oil company ' s operating bank account here in africa , i want you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this money , even an empty account can serve to receive this money , as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important transaction , trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in the near future . in all honesty , during the course of our auditing i discovered a floating fund of the above mentioned amount in account opened with the bank in 1990 and since then , nobody has operated on this account again , after going through some old files in the records i discovered that the money in the account was mapped out for the refurbishment of the oil company ' s machineries . meanwhile , mr . magnus leon , the president of the oil company was the only signatory to the account , but unfortunately he died after a brief illness in 1993 . and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it , and the account has no other beneficiary . and my investigation proved to me that mr . magnus leon , until his death had wanted to siphoned that money into his personal account in new york hence he did not disclose the operating devises of the account to the board of trustees . i am only contacting you in this regard , based on the fact that you are a foreigner because , this money can only be approved to any foreigner who can present all documents that will prove that he / she is the next of kin / beneficiary to the account base on the fact that mr . magnus leon the owner of this account is a foreigner , and the money can only be approved into a foreign bank account . therefore , if you are capable of handling this transaction with me , lets make the necessary arrangement for the hitch - free transfer of this money to any safe bank account that you may nominate , on a share percentage bases . we will start the first transfer with fifty two million usd [ $ 52 , 000 . 000 ] upon the successful actualization of the first transfer , without any disappointment from your side ; we shall re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount , to your account . however , we shall sign a binding agreement , to bind us together as partners in this regard . i am revealing this to you with believe in god that you will never let me down in this business , you are the first and the only person that i am contacting for this business , so please reply urgently and indicate your sincere interest , so that i can inform you on the modalities already mapped out for the hitch - free transfer of the money out of africa here . i will require your direct phone and fax number for easy contacting you i need your full co - operation to make this work adequately . upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and willing to meet up with the instructions of the top bank official that is deeply involved with me in this business , i shall commence actions immediately to process the payment of the money in your favor as the beneficiary . with my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any reliable foreign bank account , which you can provide . i am looking forward in anticipation to hearing from you soon as possible . yours truly , mr . kingsley mario ( alternative email : kingsleymario @ web - mail . com . ar ) please send your reply to my confidential email address only : - - zon gratis adsl . de voordelen van gratis internet met de snelheid van adsl . zonder abonnementskosten en zonder vast contract . je betaalt alleen voor de tijd online . nu zonder aansluitkosten en met gratis modem . bestel snel op zonnet . nl .

2	Subject: california update 6 / 11 / 01 executive summary : ? california claims victory over easing power prices ? california ' s budget doesn ' t look good for a vote on friday power prices sources report that generator ' s acknowledge that the drop in power prices in california last week was due at least in part to the threat of price controls . generators and traders are reportedly increasingly unwilling to line up power inventory over the next few months , which sources believe is likely to lead to increased volatility . while governor davis issued statements attributing easing power prices to his negotiating long - term contracts and made no note of increased hydrogenation in the northwest and lighter demand from cool weather in california . california budget has friday deadline sources indicate that the california legislature missing the june 15 th budget deadline , which appears likely , may affect california ' s ability to secure future financing . coupled with poor macroeconomic indicators ( such as increasing unemployment ) , the outlook for the state does not look good . sources report that the budget would have to go to print today in order for it to be printed for a vote on friday . while not going to print today does not mean that there will not be a vote friday , sources are pessimistic that the legislature will agree on a budget by friday . the republicans are reportedly concerned that the 12 . 5 b in revenue bonds will not sell when they are issued . the republicans are asking for a $ 3 - $ 5 b budget reserve as insurance against this possibility . they want to achieve this by cutting the increases to programs ( such as education , which was increased more than was mandated by law ) while leaving base program amounts alone . however , to date there has been failure to reach agreement among members over which programs to cut .

2	Subject: re : enpower i have not personally talked to james about these issues in enpower . his concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate . it is currently working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use . it is also working on correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly . london trades many more swaptions and asian options than the us ; therefore , the impact of not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them . the majority of options in the u . s . are european monthly and daily exercises and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals . the idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the us , but other more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have . once the technology is in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt . the system was originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the us and as new markets and new ideas ( such as the us becoming more and more of a financial market ) we will need to enhance enpower to follow suit . swaption vols and asian options are two of these enhancements . also , it is difficult to get option data out of enpower . we have in stage an option sensitivity matrix that , once implemented into production . i will be sure that james knows about . it probably will not solve all his problems , but it will give him a starting place . stacey enron north america corp . from : sally beck 12 / 11 / 2000 11 : 00 am to : stacey w white / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : enpower in cleaning up e : mails , i ran across this one that i had not yet read . has james called and talke with you about enpower ?

despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their var . however , as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their ' model ' / vol curve generator ( i have today asked for a full explanation , details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle ) . the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility . i would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in houston some time ago and could do with some help . we are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of it time overcoming the inadequacies of enpower wich i do not think most people are aware of . consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but i would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying . sorry it ' s so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know . james

2	Subject: fw : london work hi , how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit . it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment . in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - " a fish rots from the head . " finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting " infrastructure " ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy . well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback . thanks , iris - - - - - original message - - - - - from : shanbhogue , vasant sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm to : mack , iris cc : dhar , amitava subject : london work hi iris , amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data . hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ? vasant
