2	Subject: california update 2 / 23 / 01 please contact kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) or robert johnston ( x 39934 ) for additional information . summary gov . davis is expected to announce a plan today , however , there have been no breakthrough deals in negotiations that would support a plan . sources report that at least 7 or 8 democrats have indicated to consumer advocate harvey rosenfield that they would join republicans in blocking any proposed bailout by governor davis . this coalition would be enough to kill any transmission purchase proposal . the emergency legislative session is closed , after which all current legislation would need to be introduced in a new session . 1 . bankruptcy outlook an advisor to mbia * is attempting to pull other creditors into an informal pre - petition committee . however , the creditors are finding that their interests are not always the same , and inter - creditor politics are becoming very active at this point . for instance : - bc hydro is not inclined to take aggressive action , even though they are one of the biggest creditors . as their power is hydro , they are operating with a huge margin - i . e . , they do not owe any other companies for gas used to produce their power . - reliant , using the " squeaky wheel " theory , took a hard line with the governor and succeeded in extracting a partial payment from dwr in exchange for a 30 - day agreement to supply power . other creditors have seen this and are thinking along similar lines . - the generators and qfs as a whole are not very organized yet . the qfs are negotiating with the state on reducing the amount they are prepared to get paid for the power they supply , but the negotiations reportedly are not going well , and there is no deal in sight . reportedly the state has offered to pay the qfs $ . 07 / kwh , but the qfs want $ . 09 / kwh . * mbia is a credit insurer . in other words , if a company issues revenue bonds , mbia , for a fee , will reimburse the bondholders for their losses up to a certain level ( e . g . the first 10 - 15 % ) . i believe it at one time stood for municipal bond insurers ' association . they have a aaa rating . 2 . legislative activity once the extraordinary session is closed by the governor it ends and all bills in that session are dead . they would have to be reintroduced with new bill numbers and run through the process again . if the bills have already been heard once in committee it is probable these bills will be taken up for a vote . the legislator is having so many hearings on bills this week to try and get as many through before the extraordinary session ends .

2	Subject: re : updates to processes dear rick , thanks for the update . i appreciate your input as i do not know what your discussions with rick buy have been . to address your points below : 1 ) i agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each individual review although i am under the impression that ted & sally ( by proxy cassandra and i ) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process . if my understanding is incorrect , please let me know . 2 ) i agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings . however , due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to delivery of the report to ted and sally , your group really has to be focused on completing the deal test . we don ' t need three different people obtaining the same information at the same meetings . if there has been a change in your group ' s role from what i originally understood ( we need lower level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test ) , we may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it is done on time ( by the time we leave the site ) . 3 ) agreed - i ' d like to hear what donna and mike neeves have resolved as far as the database is concerned before we meet again . best regards shona to : shona wilson / na / enron @ enron cc : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , cassandra schultz / na / enron @ enron , lynn bellinghausen / enron _ development @ enron _ development , donna lowry / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : updates to processes shona : thank you for your memo . i think it is a good idea to define roles and responsibilities and i appreciate the fact that you have taken the initiative to do so . however , i do have the following comments : 1 ) i have some accountability to rick buy for the success of this effort , therefore i ( or my designee ) need to be involved in doorstep pre - planning and post - mortem . i will be involved in reviewing the final report before presentation and will attend the meeting when the report is presented to buy and causey . 2 ) i realize that in the interest of getting a review done timely it is sometimes necessary to " divide and conquer " . however , where logistically possible , i believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in meetings held with commercial personnel . this facilitates understanding operations , document flow , points of contact , report writing as well as furthering our goal of educating " multi - functional " people so that we can continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews . 3 ) there are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding the database . let ' s schedule another meeting with cassandra and donna . please let me know if you have any questions , regards , rick

2	Subject: alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders dear generation / power marketing executive : the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred friday , december 15 1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order . ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s web site at : http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html ) 2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at california supplies ordered by richardson o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 , unless extended o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977 as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill richardson found " an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage of electric energy " and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts . the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm , eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power . the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe headquarters every 24 hours . the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the iso " are to be agreed to by the parties . " if no agreement is reached , then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson " will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable . " the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section from ferc to doe . the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities are ordered " to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by the " iso , " acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . " [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ; electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ] ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural reforms a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of region - wide price caps . ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s " seriously flawed " market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west . while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms . hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission had either " over - reached " or not gone far enough , just as they did on november 1 , as discussed below . highlights of key actions : ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately , the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) . ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh " soft cap " proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a " comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures " must be in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can be place by the may 1 , deadline . in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days . as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly basis and provide certain cost support . ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process . ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh " price benchmark " for assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing long - term contracts . to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participants . ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market . ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file generation interconnection standards . ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order , including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 , 2001 . ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and negotiating protective orders associated with data collection . ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient reserve requirements . commissioner responses comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a " missed opportunity " to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns , hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of the order ( " balanced and considerate " ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh " soft cap " proposal . hebert ended by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements . comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly " walked the line " by taking all of the competing interests into account , calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable . comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of 60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rules more like pjm . finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint , preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally , he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds . chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest . however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california situation , the chairman stated that competition or " deregulation " did not fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .

2	Subject: your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a " rac " dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to " swag " average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable " swag " approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results . 
2	Subject: re : energy derivatives hi vince , hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .

2	Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction . deal terms - - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing . - - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas . - - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares . - - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year . enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary . management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo . i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron . management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined . the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible . as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses . i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 . i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse . and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron . investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ;

2	Subject: california controller refuses to pay tab for cdwr staff ' s sushi and pizza blackouts don ' t justify takeout , connell says by ed fletcher bee capitol bureau ( published july 25 , 2001 ) while operating in " crisis " mode , department of water resources staff worked 20 - hour days , slept in conference rooms and were fed pizza and sushi by the state as the department tried to keep california ' s lights on . saying the department " charged enough to feed a small army , " state controller kathleen connell now is asking those employees to pay the state back about $ 3 , 600 for department food purchases in january . " we are not going to be paying these bills , " connell told reporters tuesday . the state does not buy business - hour meals for staff while they are in town , connell said . additionally , the use of a government - issued credit card to make the purchases was improper , she said . if the department does not require the employees to pay for the takeout meals , she said , the department will have to absorb the cost . the department of water resources began scrambling to buy power jan . 17 after gov . gray davis declared a state of emergency - - the same day northern california was hit with rolling power blackouts . as a result of the department ' s new responsibility , staff members buying power were asked to work nearly around the clock , said oscar hidalgo , a department spokesman . buying food for staff during crisis situations is nothing out of the norm , hidalgo said . " under emergencies such as these . . . we believe we were in a position to do this . our staff did nothing other than it would do during a flood , " hidalgo said . california ' s recent success in keeping the lights on has led people to forget the level of crisis the state was in , hidalgo said . " it seems at every turn . . . people are making monday morning quarterback calls , " he said . connell and her aides said buying power is not the same as firefighters getting food while battling a blaze . they said using the " cal - card " for buying food is specifically prohibited . " it ' s not an open line of credit , " she said . the bee ' s ed fletcher can be reached at ( 916 ) 326 - 5548 or efletcher @ sacbee . com .

2	Subject: anthrax scare in dc house speaker hastert has decided to close the entire capitol complex , including the office buildings on the house side , at the end of the working day today through monday , as a precautionary move to allow for special agents and germ experts to conduct a sweep of the ventilation systems and all remaining unopened mail . the senate side is expected to do the same . it has also been confirmed that the anthrax - laden letter sent to senate majority leader daschle ' s office was of a particularly potent , high grade military quality anthrax that quickly spread once opened . some 29 staff in dachle ' s office or the mail room have tested positive , and some anthrax spores were found in the ventilation system of the hart building ( where daschle ' s office is located ) and in one of the tunnels leading to the capitol itself . if there is even a hint that this military grade anthrax came from iraq , there will be a strike by the u . s . against iraq . another possibility is that the anthrax is of russian origin and was somehow illicitly acquired by al qaeda or the taliban . there has not been a second anthrax letter or a new outbreak of anthrax , nor is there any evidence of anthrax spores spreading to committee rooms located in the other senate or house buildings . this was a pre - cautionary move by house speaker hastert , though it in no way diminishes how ugly the situation is .

2	Subject: netco structuring re - start plan louise et al we have began the following initiatives to have a structuring function ready for operation within netco as well as other related issues to be addressed : structuring model capabilities - we are moving all of the existing gas and power structuring models into a directory to be transferred to netco at the appropriate time . we will need to provide the estate with formal documentation ( from yourself and / or jim fallon ) for the transfer of these assets into netco ( per vince kaminski ' s request ) . these models have historically been property of the research group . we have initiated the process of transferring the ownership of this to a designated it person within the netco organization . ( see attached for more detail ) deal processes / controls - once legal / credit formalize the contract forms we will be using for netco , we should discuss a deal approval process to implement . i would assume the old ena process would be the template we would follow with adjustments to be made for new corporate structure / ownership , appropriate approval levels of transactions , etc . issue - will there be a rac - like group to provide overall deal documentation ? i ' m sure this issue will be addressed as transactions start to hit the radar and the collective owners of netco will sign off on a control process . back office execution capability - once the structuring models and the risk systems have been formally moved to the new it enviroment , we will begin testing the models to the risk books to ensure valuation accuracy . we may want to talk about the reporting mechanisms from both the risk system and structuring models to include cash flow reporting tools in addition to mtm reporting . this may be a useful tool to front - end manage our cash position / exposure . i ' ve also attached a table with details of the above initiatives and estimated timelines . please call me with questions . berney x 34784

2	Subject: state senate oks bailing out edison from bankruptcy assembly plans own version for utility fyi . fairly accurate account of the activities in california . assembly released new version of hertzberg ' s bill late last night . another update to follow shortly . best , jeff state senate oks bailing out edison from bankruptcy assembly plans own version for utility lynda gledhill and robert salladay , chronicle sacramento bureau saturday , july 21 , 2001 ? 2001 san francisco chronicle url : http : / / www . sfgate . com / cgi - bin / article . cgi ? f  / c / a / 2001 / 07 / 21 / mnl 33267 . dtl sacramento - - the state senate approved a plan yesterday to keep southern california edison from falling into bankruptcy , but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and gov . gray davis faces an uncertain future . the bill by democratic sens . richard polanco of los angeles and byron sher of palo alto would give the state a five - year option to buy the utility ' s transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $ 2 . 5 billion of the utility ' s debt . edison amassed an estimated $ 3 . 5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen . the assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night , but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to california ' s botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers . davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before aug . 15 , a date set in the original agreement between davis and edison . lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night , but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town . " it ' s a firm deadline , which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess , " davis said of the aug . 15 date . davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills , but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days . " i have problems with both bills , " davis said . " i am heartened by the fact that there ' s a bill moving in each house . " both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote , and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process . in the senate , 22 democrats voted for the edison plan , while four democrats and all 13 republicans voted no . sen . jackie speier , d - hillsborough , said she would vote for the bill in its current form , but not if any substantial changes are made . " the legislature is ill - equipped to try to craft a deal , " she said . " this particular measure - - and only this one - - has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers . i ' m leery of the bill going to the assembly and being cannibalized . " the senate bill authorizes edison to issue $ 2 . 5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks . the bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged edison ' s largest customers and would not cover the $ 1 billion edison owes out - of - state generators . edison maintains that the senate bill will not make the company creditworthy , which would put it back in the position of buying power . the state has been spending upward of $ 50 million a day on power since january , and davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power . there is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get pacific gas & electric co . out of bankruptcy . in the assembly , two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill . the rescue plan by assembly speaker robert hertzberg of sherman oaks and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek , was undergoing changes to garner more support . some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal . assemblywoman elaine alquist , d - san jose , one of the undecided members on the edison agreement , said the original bill was too complex . " it ' s a cleaner bill , " alquist said . " i think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to pg & e . i would say i ' m tentatively satisfied . " alquist and other democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the edison negotiations . only a few members of the assembly - - all former state senators now in the lower house - - voted to approve the 1996 legislation , abl 890 , that brought deregulation to california . assemblyman joseph simitian , d - palo alto , said he gave a courtesy vote to the hertzberg - keeley plan in the appropriations committee , in order to get the measure to the assembly floor and continue debate . " as we ' ve learned from the experience of abl 890 , the devil is in the details . i have a lot of questions , " simitian said . " the difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline , and then once there is a deadline , too much gets done . " hertzberg acknowledged that some assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed , but he said lawmakers are well - informed about the energy crisis and its details . he said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis . a wild card in the assembly ' s plan was a bill by assemblyman rod wright , d - los angeles , that garnered republican support . the so - called " straight bailout " would give edison its $ 3 . 5 billion through a $ 2 - a - month fee levied on utility ratepayers . it was stuck in the assembly appropriations committee . e - mail the reporters at lgledhill @ sfchronicle . com and rsalladay @ sfchronicle . com . ? 2001 san francisco chronicle page a - 3

[ 65 , 229 ] in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march 30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential . the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore , edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly , edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon by edison states that rates " shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . " ( emphasis added . ) further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles [ 65 , 236 ] for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case , where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted . affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos . er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 ) turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months . without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we therefore uphold the judge on this point . we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be made as frequently . related to pmas reg - preamble , fercsr ? 36 , 710 , procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr 903 , 45 fr 86976 [ 36 , 741 ] historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules . many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations , loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 . these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa - type standards where applicable . many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts . the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra 6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate design . related to purpa fed - law , fercsr ? 5021 , purpa , sec . 111 . consideration and determination respecting certain ratemaking standards . ( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . fed - reg - notice , fercsr ? 37 , 503 , doe responsibilities under title i of purpa ( 4 ) seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season ; prop - reg - preamble , fercsr 1988 - 1998 ? 32 , 457 , administrative determination of full avoided costs , sales of power to qualifying facilities , and inter - connection facilities , march 16 , 1988 , docket no . rm 88 - 6 - 000 , 53 fr 9331 , 55 fr 31882 pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while [ 32 , 174 ] the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors . to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts , especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts . reg - preamble , fercsr 1977 - 1981 ? 30 , 128 , small power production and cogeneration facilities ; regulations implementing section 210 of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 , order no . 69 , february 25 , 1980 , docket no . rm 79 - 55 , 18 cfr 292 , 45 fr 12214 , 45 fr . . . rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation by juan . a . lozano associated press writer 10 / 31 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover . shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said . on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 . enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week . the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades . potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit . " shell tried to be in the merchant energy arena and didn ' t really succeed , " he said . " to buy into an established franchise must be attractive to shell . " enron officials did not immediately return telephone calls from the associated press on wednesday . while enron ' s stock price has made it attractive , coale said the energy marketer ' s problems present a substantial drawback . " i would fault a company for acquiring enron with all of this hanging over it , " she said . " there are too many uncertainties . " grubert said he believes enron has the ability " to weather the storm and restore their enterprise on their own . " since reporting its disappointing third quarter losses , enron has been negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines . the company last week decided to cash in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : few signs of domino effect among enron ' s peers . by andrew kelly 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , oct 31 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy traders such as dynegy inc . and aquila inc . have taken a knock as a result of enron corp ' s recent woes , but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered . " the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , " said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . " i don ' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , " he said . enron ' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company ' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks . and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said . " enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , " said prudential securities analyst carole coale . uncomfortable with disclosure coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron ' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron ' s profits . el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants . analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron . el paso ' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company ' s earnings . dynegy ' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy ' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors ' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio . asked about dynegy ' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any " related party transactions " . former high - fliers shunned analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies ' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines . in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks . on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an " asset - light " philosophy . williams ' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke ' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market . j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface . " enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn ' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , " he said . credit lyonnais securities ' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was . " trading companies have always had a history of winning big and losing big , " he said .

' ' myers joined the company in november 1999 as it struggled to track costs from acquisitions . he has put new financial - systems software in place and made other efforts to cut costs . the company has also raised prices where it ' s the dominant hauler . myers ' s efforts , along with the sale of overseas businesses , have helped the company regain regard among investors . the shares have risen 22 percent in the past year . pulp and paper most of waste management ' s solid - waste customers produce or consume pulp and paper . waste management collects , processes and sells more than five million tons a year of paper , plastic , glass , aluminum and other metals . recycled - cardboard prices fell 62 percent to $ 48 a ton in the second quarter from $ 125 a year earlier , and the price for recycled newsprint fell to $ 55 a ton from $ 90 , myers said in august . prices were little changed from the second quarter to the third quarter , said steve ragiel , waste management ' s vice president of recycling . waste management , which will report third - quarter results next week , had expected to begin trading in the third quarter . its plans were delayed because it took longer than expected to find people to run the operation , raigel said . jeff harbert , formerly of enron corp . , is heading the operation along with two other enron traders . enron , also based in houston , has created the largest business of trading commodities including electricity , natural gas , pulp and paper . risk management waste management ' s initial focus in the trading business will be on managing its own price risk . it probably only will complete five to 10 trades in each of the first few months , raigel said . the company hopes to set fixed prices for the commodities it picks up , then sell those commodities to a third company , such as a paper producer , at a higher set price . ` ` we ' ll get with a counter party such as a paper mill or a consumer - products company and cut a deal , ' ' raigel said . ` ` we can find a paper mill that wants to lock in a fixed price on what they buy and what they sell . they get a minimum return on their investment and greater control on their raw material costs . ' ' the company hasn ' t said how much it expects to make from trading . analysts aren ' t expecting the business to contribute significantly to waste management ' s earnings . ` ` they are looking at it as a good time to get in on trading but i don ' t see it as a major contributor to their business , ' ' said stewart scharf , an analyst with standard & poor ' s equity group . he rates waste management ` ` accumulate ' ' and doesn ' t own shares . republic services group inc . , the no . 3 u . s . waste company , contracts with individual mills to supply recycled commodities at fixed prices , but hasn ' t started a trading operation , spokesman will flower said . allied waste industries inc . , the second - largest trash hauler in north america , said it has no plans to get into trading . ` ` we ' ll leave trading to people like enron , ' ' allied waste spokesman michael burnett said . - - mark johnson in the princeton newsroom ( 609 ) 750 - 4662 enron ends 10 - day skid with 25 % jump lisa sanders cbsmarketwatch . com october 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked wednesday after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron added 25 percent , or $ 2 . 74 , to close at $ 13 . 90 . more than 43 million shares changed hands , making the stock the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . a . g . edwards ' analyst michael heim warned wednesday against buying enron shares . he noted that enron ' s troubles could be hurting its trading operations , the company ' s strength . " people interested in betting on ene should ask themselves this - - if a person offered to double your money when a coin lands heads and take away half your money when it is tails , would you take the bet ? what if the person flipping the coin is a magician you don ' t trust ? " a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . an enron spokesman said the company doesn ' t comment on such matters . enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris , said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point . " however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase , " he said . olson pointed out that enron ' s heavy losses over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday . " mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron , " he said . " mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today . " taking bets art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers . " it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle . " on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business . " it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly , " smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a " look - back provision , " which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ge capital or royal dutch shell making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report . " ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this , " smith said . " and shell always keeps us guessing . " olson also included aig and citigroup as potential acquirers . " enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture , " he said . smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive . " even if enron went away , it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging , " he said . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation by juan . a . lozano associated press writer 10 / 31 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover . shares of enron , the largest u . s . natural gas and power marketer , rose dlrs 2 . 74 to close at dlrs 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . though still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said . on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at dlrs 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 . enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of dlrs 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week . the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades . potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit .

" at this level the stock is attracting money . however , the near term is not going to be good , " said tim ghriskey , president of money managers ghriskey capital partners llc . " we don ' t own any enron . we have in the past and sold a while ago . we ' ve been tempted a couple of times during the slide , but the information flow is not that strong , and there is potential for more negative surprises . " enron closed up $ 2 . 74 , or 24 . 6 percent , to $ 13 . 90 on the nyse . the stock surged to an intraday high of $ 14 . 17 , recouping the past two days of losses , but is far from $ 33 . 84 , the closing price for enron on oct . 16 , the last day before the 10 - day tumble began . enron shares have been hammered over the past two weeks amid a series of unwelcome disclosures , including murky off - balance - sheet deals with partnerships once run by chief financial officer andrew fastow . the disclosures forced fastow ' s ouster , led to a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron and caused at least one credit rating agency to cut enron ' s senior - debt credit status . the company said fastow ' s removal was aimed at assuaging investor concerns as the almost daily disclosures forced it to draw down about $ 3 billion from existing credit lines . trying to quantify ' worst - case scenario ' but that ' s not enough , say analysts and investors . " enron needs to substantially improve the level of disclosures , " said nitin khandkar , a portfolio manager with dubai - based al majid investment co . , which owns enron stock . " the accounting policies it follows should not be merely legal but should also reflect the company ' s true profitability . " as an industry heavyweight , " investors expect enron to come clean on the controversial issues , " he said . one issue enron would do well to address is its partnerships and the liabilities they may have . " people are still struggling with trying to quantify what the worst - case scenario could be , " said mike heim , an analyst with a . g . edwards & sons , of the existing partnerships . " instead of dismissing the worst - case scenario , i think it would make sense to mathematically show that ' here ' s what happens under such a scenario ' and then let analysts make their own assessments . " enron ' s refusal to make public its finances with greater transparency is a hallmark of arrogance , noted one academic . " the lack of transparency is an arrogance that says , ' i don ' t have to explain anything because if people don ' t want to buy my shares , they can just sit and spin , ' " said paul kedrosky , a professor at the university of british columbia who sits on the board of exponentia , a company dedicated to improving communications with shareholders .

' s press release about its third - quarter results included this statement , attributed to louis gerstner , chairman and chief executive officer : ` ` ibm ' s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the technology industry , or any industry . ' ' the largest maker of computers and provider of computer services wasn ' t the only company to cite its balance sheet , a statistical summary of what a company owned , what it owed , and what was left over for shareholders on a specific date . general electric co . , the largest company by stock market value , and citigroup inc . , the no . 1 financial - services company , made similar references in their third - quarter releases . none of the companies really showed people what they were telling them . ibm , general electric and citigroup are among 19 members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent quarterly releases didn ' t include balance sheets . the evidence will come only when the companies submit their quarterly reports to the u . s . securities and exchange commission . balance sheets are required in the so - called 10 - q filings , along with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year . not much publicity by then , statistics about the companies ' assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the accounting terms for what ' s owned , what ' s owed and what ' s left over , will be rather outdated . u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year for 10 - k reports . these filings usually don ' t arrive until weeks after the publication of earnings releases . so it ' s easy to overlook the additional information they provide , especially when it doesn ' t receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does . yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at their own peril . enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs in the third quarter from an expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter . these numbers were part of the houston - based company ' s income statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or losses during a specified time period . income statements are the cornerstone of any company ' s earnings release . billion - dollar numbers the release didn ' t even mention a larger figure that affected the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders ' equity during the quarter resulting from the company ' s repurchase of 55 million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial officer last week . chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a subsequent conference call . such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors ' fortunes . since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron ' s shares have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 . enron ' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity ' ' which contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that item was later put at $ 35 million . the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall figure for ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs , and less than 1 percent of the company ' s $ 47 . 6 billion in revenue for the quarter . growing debt burden the $ 1 . 2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in dollars , but also in percentage terms . enron had $ 11 . 74 billion of shareholders ' equity as of june 30 , according to the balance sheet in its second - quarter 10 - q filing . the reduction equaled more than 10 percent of that total . among other things , the balance sheet also shows that the company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year ' s first half . short - term debt , due in one year or less , doubled to $ 3 . 46 billion . long - term debt , maturing in more than one year , rose 9 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 36 billion . there ' s even more to the story of enron ' s indebtedness . the company guaranteed $ 3 . 3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and marlin water trust , which bought some of its power plants . unless they pay off the debt by reselling the plants , the company may have to come up with the difference . nevertheless , any summary of a company ' s financial position provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone . this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better shape -

2	Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction . deal terms - - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing . - - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas . - - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares . - - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year . enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary . management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo . i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron . management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined . the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible . as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses . i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 . i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse . and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron . investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ;

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on . another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the " wiggling " that often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip ! a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to hear that so many people are enjoying the tips . talk to you again in a few weeks . jon garbison on - line editor woodsmith visit our other woodworking and home improvement sites : 100 + woodworking plans : woodsmith magazine : shopnotes magazine : workbench magazine : kits , jigs , tools , project plans : back issues : woodworking forums : to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at to unsubscribe , send empty email message to : note : your subscribed email address is

2	Subject: re : preface for book julie , the introduction looks fine . i have made some cosmetic changes ( typos and split infinitives that slipped by ) . you can safely ignore most of them . english is not even my second language . the corrections are in pink . vince " julie " on 08 / 01 / 2000 07 : 43 : 10 am to : " vincejkaminski " cc : subject : preface for book vince , ? hope you are well . ? we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are . ? thanks , julie ( we ' re getting close ) ? ? preface ? ? ? one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs . ? in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ? in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout the book . ? in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . ? chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . ? chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors . ? chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback options , and ladder options . ? chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model . ? chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options . ? chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . ? chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ? in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  ) illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed . ? chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var ) applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . ? finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives . ? before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however , the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !

2	Subject: thestreet . com : trade winds blowing enron further south trade winds blowing enron further south by peter eavis senior columnist 08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation . a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings . for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double . now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower . in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move . enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman . but skeptics remain unconvinced . " i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , " says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected . details , details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . ) enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . ) enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold . however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter . the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit . partners indeed the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently . the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line . the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results . then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as " significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . " some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels . skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ? in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million . put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ? an enron spokeswoman responds : " eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . " and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal . a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers . this person also says the gain was " immaterial " to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states . whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . " they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , " concludes off wall street ' s roberts . know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com . in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships .

" for the insurance buyer , such exchange instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle , but as long as they are quantifiable and indexable , they may represent a good surrogate , " he said . the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for over - the - counter securitized deals , if there are regular issuers of catastrophe bonds , mr . lane said . the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of exchange - based insurance products , said sean f . mooney , senior vp and chief economist at guy carpenter & co . , the reinsurance brokerage unit of marsh inc . in new york . " the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not looking for other ways of doing business , " he said . at least in concept , the exchange - based deals are generally similar to the mortgage - backed securities that have been a huge success since they were introduced in the 1970 s . " there is a belief that alternative means of transferring risks will grow , but it is difficult to predict when , " mr . mooney said . currently , the trading that is taking place typically involves established insurers and reinsurers , so the exchanges have not brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace , he said . guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities exchange reinsurance products . the bce did not take off , however , and was suspended last year after two years of little activity . the oldest of the insurance - related , exchange - based derivative products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board of trade , which began trading the options in 1996 . initially , there was substantial interest in the options , but the soft traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge catastrophe exposures , said carlton purty , an independent broker at the cbot who trades in options . no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot so far this year , he said . last year , there was increased interest in the contracts because of hurricane floyd , but few contracts were traded , mr . purty said . " i think a major , major catastrophe will have to happen before they really take off , " he said . the contracts offer real protection , and options dealers are keen to trade in a new niche , but the conventional insurance and reinsurance markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative coverage options , mr . purty said . the catastrophe risk exchange , located in princeton , n . j . , has radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in mid - 1996 , and it is well positioned to expand , said frank sweeney , chief operating officer . catex initially planned to be a computer - based facility for reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks and to build balanced portfolios . but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 , it was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance , mr . sweeney said . although there was some interest in risk swapping , only a handful of risks were posted on the system , and none was traded , mr . sweeney said . consequently , catex has become chiefly a " cash for cover " exchange , he said , noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange include property catastrophe coverage , aviation and liability coverages . catex also trades industry loss warranties , where coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry loss over an agreed threshold . other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible through the internet in november 1998 . and late last year , catex offered users the ability to set up smaller networks , allowing them form groups whose members do business only with one another . since its inception , catex has completed about 450 trades , totaling $ 400 million in premium and more than $ 3 billion in limits , he said . catex ' s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers , insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their captives , mr . sweeney said . " we obviously have a long way to go , but we are pretty satisfied with what we have achieved so far , " mr . sweeney said . the exchange sees increased activity after major losses , as cedents seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their existing cover , he said . for example , mr . sweeney said , there was a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last year . last september , the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field of insurance - related derivatives when it began offering weather derivatives . thus far , 420 futures contracts have been traded , said larry grannan , senior director in product marketing at the cme . such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against weather - related losses . for example , a utility may sell less power in a mild winter , and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a resultant fall in revenues . the exchange first offered heat - based indexes for atlanta , chicago , cincinnati and new york . in january , it added philadelphia , dallas , des moines , las vegas , tucson and portland , and it began offering contracts based on cold weather . currently , most of the trades are between securities dealers themselves , but , eventually , the contracts will likely be used more extensively by utilities and insurers , mr . grannan said . in addition , the futures contracts could be used as hedges for over - the - counter securitized deals , he said . copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

2	Subject: upw presents : meltdown - wednesday july 20 th ! wednesday , july 20 th , 2005 8 : 00 pm meltdown only hours away ! that  s right , as we speak , i am counting down the hours , minutes , and seconds until upw once again invades its old stomping grounds ( literally ) at the galaxy theatre . as if the upw returns of luther  horshu  reigns , sakoda , kazarian and hardkore kidd , 10 huge matches , and a musical performance by tijuana bullfight were not enough  lil nate : out to prove that he is for real . at upw  s last outing at the galaxy ,  homecoming havoc  , one of the unquestionable highlights was lil nate  s upset victory over the longest reigning lightweight champion in upw history , frankie kazarian . the match was a true classic back and forth battle in which nate finally bested kazarian with a reversal and roll up . since then , many have stated that nate  s victory was a fluke , and that he will be unable to live up to kazarian  s lofty standards . the current lightweight champion is no stranger to having the odds against him , in fact , he thrives on it . nate began training at the young age of 14 . at 135 lbs . soaking wet along with a big red afro , just about everyone broke into laughter when they heard of nate  s intentions to become a wrestler . as it turns out , it would be the perennial underdog who would have the last laugh . since he started his training , nate has blossomed into one of southern california  s most dynamic and talented in - ring performers . he recently helped wwe  s best prepare for their wrestlemania 21 matches as he participated in the pre - mania workouts sessions . he has also been on the road with hall of famer , rowdy roddy piper . now he finds himself the upw lightweight champion after scoring the biggest win of his career . it is now on to the next challenge , proving that he is a deserving champion . nate made it clear that he would be a fighting champion who will take on the best lightweight challengers in and out of upw . he will have a chance to do just that when he defends the gold against davie richards at meltdown . richards who has wrestled matches for wwe , tna , nwa , pwg , and other promotions will bring his skills and wealth of experience into a upw ring for the first time . will nate silence his critics with a successful defense , or will richards capture lightning in a bottle and the upw lightweight championship in his upw debut ? regardless , this should be a very competitive title match . skulu and predator clash in a battle of upw  s big men ! while nate and richards will most likely put on a clinic when it comes to high - flying and scientific wrestling , don  t expect too much in the way of finesse as two of upw  s biggest and most popular superstars lock horns in this  colossal jostle  ! both men have gleaming win / loss records in upw . as a result , it is very difficult to pick a favorite in this one . both have become international stars in japan . predator is in the best condition of his life as he has been training for mixed martial arts competition as part of valor fighting . if the match goes past the five - minute mark , predator may have the advantage due to conditioning . countering that is the fact that skulu will have no less than 30 family members and friends on hand to cheer him on . will this be enough to inspire the powerful polynesian to pick up a very rare victory over predator ? make sure you are on hand to find out ! japan  s sumie sakai makes upw debut @ meltdown ! as a special added bonus attraction , one of the most respected and impressive female performers from japan , sumie sakai will make her upw debut at the galaxy . this is another example of how upw is working to showcase the skills of many of the world  s greatest grapplers for its dedicated southern california fans . over the years upw has brought in the likes of ohtani , tanaka , hoshikowa , konnan , psicosis , juventud guerrera , the late great shinya hashimoto , and many more . no word yet on who sakai will battle in her debut match . all tickets only $ 15 tickets on sale now : the galaxy box office ( 714 - 957 - 0600 ) , ticketmaster outlets and ticketmaster . com featuring appearances by featuring in in ring action : the masterpiece chris masters frankie kazarian sakoda hardkore kidd jesus aguilera upw heavyweight champion tom howard - vs - luther horshu reigns skulu - vs - the predator old school oliver john - vs - joey ryan upw lightweight champion lil ' nate - vs - davie richards scott lost - vs - antonio mestre upw tag team champions the ballard brothers - vs - the southside g ' s triple threat tag team match tommy wilson shawn riddik the good guys lionheart the human tornado also featuring in in - ring action : ma ' koa andrew hellman card subject to change featuring a live musical performance by : tijuana bullfight ' s official website listen to a sample of tijuana bullfight : stream lo - fi mp 3 stream hi - fi mp 3 mp 3 streams courtesy of cdbaby . com wednesday , july 20 th , 2005 8 : 00 pm all tickets only $ 15 tickets on sale now : the galaxy box office ( 714 - 957 - 0600 ) , ticketmaster outlets and ticketmaster . com to be removed from the upw mailing list , please send a blank email with remove in the subject field to news @ upw . com

2	Subject: calpine plant did you see the following in the gas daily today ? calif . approves calpine plant the california energy commission on monday gave the final go - ahead for calpine to begin con - struction on its 600 - mw , natural gas - fired metcalf energy center in san jose , the company said . the approval follows a two - and - a - half year battle against local interests opposed to the proj - ect , which will be located in power - hungry silicon valley . calpine is partnering with bechtel enter - prises to build the plant . the initial tide of local opposition was finally turned by widespread support for the proposed facility from state energy agencies , gov . gray davis and environmental groups . san jose ' s city council had initially refused to give zoning approval for the facility but changed tack after the groundswell of statewide support and the seriousness of the state ' s energy shortage became apparent . " we have always believed this is an ideal location for a plant , in a region without its own local source of significant power generation , " ken abreu , general manager for joint development for the companies , said in a statement . calpine and bechtel will begin construction next month , with the start of commercial opera - tions set for the second half of 2003 .

2	Subject: b 2 b at enron tom , i am sending you the information about our new b 2 b unit . i have talked yesterday with greg whalley who is heading the new unit about the e - commerce project at wharton and recommended that enron join this program . i have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me . the meeting with jeff skilling has been pushed till the 2 nd half of july . i talked to him briefly twice that jeff shankman and i want to discuss with him building a relationship with wharton . jeff shankman is , by the way , a great friend of your institution . vince * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * companies & finance : the americas : enron sees bricks and bytes mix reshaping energy market : purchase of mg only a start in building b 2 b platforms , writes hillary durgin : companies financial times ; 16 - jun - 2000 12 : 00 : 00 am ; 604 words by hillary durgin if jeffrey skilling is right , enron ' s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the iceberg . enron ' s president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the houston energy company , aimed at making it a dominant " new economy " player across various industrial markets . the dollars 446 m acquisition last month of mg , the uk - based metals trader , is only the first of more than dollars lbn in estimated new investments the company is targeting . it is seeking vehicles on which to build business - to - business ( b 2 b ) platforms in sectors such as logistics , chemicals , agricultural products and pulp & paper . mr skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets . he argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal b 2 b sites for those sectors , but reshape those industries . as an example , he points to enron ' s new e - commerce platform , enrononline , which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales . the company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power - saw wholesale , physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first quarter . critics argue that enron ' s move away from its familiar energy business into new industries , where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched , is risky . yet a number of industry analysts point out enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the uk , the largest trader of gas and power in the us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth . " it ' s a prudent strategy , but it ' s got to be done in an orderly way , " says ronald barone , analyst with paine - webber in new york . " what they ' re doing here is what they ' ve been incredibly successful at doing , " he adds , noting that enron posted dollars 1 . 3 bn in earnings before interest and taxes ( ebit ) from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999 , up 34 per cent from the previous year . earnings from that division accounted for two - thirds of the company ' s overall income before interest and taxes last year , and mr barone sees the unit ' s ebit increasing 15 - 30 per cent annually over several years . as with gas and power and now broadband , where enron is standardising contracts and creating a market in bandwidth , it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant , risk management and financial services over the internet . " we will provide electronic commerce , but we will provide liquidity and we will provide settlement , or fulfilment of that contract , " mr skilling says . " that is an extremely powerful model . if you look at other b 2 b sites , they don ' t do that . " mr skilling argues enron ' s e - commerce platform will triumph over the other , bulletin board - type exchanges , where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing , price , credit and fulfilment . not everyone shares that view . some energy companies , for example , would rather not do business with a competitor . bp amoco recently purchased a 3 per cent stake in altra energy technologies , a houston - based , neutral wholesale energy exchange . with koch industries and american electric power , it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity . just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals , enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets . in acquiring mg , enron got a stable of warehouses , lending it a strong physical position . " it should provide ( mg ) with a more vibrant , more active physical spot market in more markets in the world , " says greg whalley , chief executive officer of enron net works , the new division enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets . he argues that in metals and other markets , enron will deliver better pricing , price risk management services , cross - commodity transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers . mr skilling says there are significant rewards for restructuring an industry . " if you can take that platform , and you use the capabilities the bricks bring to the table , e - commerce the industry and change the structure , you ' re selling for more than a 50 multiple .

2	Subject: vince and vasant : here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at the east desk , related to gas transmission : typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay $ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( " shrinkage " ) and 6 . 5 % for overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( " basis " ) , and might call brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is $ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow . as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity . also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum ( " it ' s not worth their time to haggle " ) ( there is a further issue of " secondary markets " not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take ( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline , in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts . clayton

duran , w . david subject : fw : onondaga louise / dave : we have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding onondaga as i mentioned in our meeting yesterday . for whatever reason , our interest in onondaga ( through the cash flow interest agreement ) is viewed by accounting as a receivable . from a commercial standpoint , this is incorrect , but at the end of the day , it doesn ' t really matter . billy ' s e - mail below basically states that because of how the onondaga interest has been classified , we should reduce the $ 7 . 9 million by the $ 1 . 1 million payment received last week , but then readjust the value of the asset . based on our internal valuation , and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser , adjusting the value of the " receivable " to $ 10 million ( after application of the $ 1 . 1 million payment received ) would be very conservative . this would net a gain of $ 3 . 1 million for q 3 . with your concurrence , i will work with billy to support the adjustment of onondaga to $ 10 million ( and therefore the gain of $ 3 . 1 million ) . i will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise . please let me know if you have any questions . regards , ben - - - - - original message - - - - - from : fleenor , william sent : wednesday , september 19 , 2001 5 : 57 pm to : jacoby , ben subject : re : onondaga ben , based upon the review of the cashflow interest agreement , partnership agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income . the basis that is carried on our books currently ( approx . $ 7 . 9 mm ) represents a long - term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ena and oclp . in addition , this asset does not qualify for the mtm or fair value accounting models . the payment received from oclp based on the cashflow interest agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books . however , it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce / write - off $ 8 million of this long - term receivable based upon the best information available at the time . as stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been . this would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible . this will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year . this basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as mtm . a few things need to be noted : 1 ) support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset . please provide this to me 2 ) you will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset . supposedly corp took the write down . . . . may cause problems . 3 ) somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create . it is my understanding that rac and credit are not involved . 4 ) we need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year . we will probably get questioned by aa . please call me if you would like to discuss . regards , billy - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jacoby , ben sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 9 : 37 pm to : fleenor , william ;

british columbian government exploring energy issues ? bc hydro readies itself for transmission line sale ? bpa aborts additional rate increase , refutes california ' s overcharge claims bc government the bc liberals have announced that they are putting together a new policy task force on energy to deal with energy issues going forward . they will be looking at the province ' s energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward . the task force includes : jack ebbels , deputy minister of the ministry of energy and mines , chair peter meekison , energy policy consultant john bechtold , oil and gas expert erik westergaard , hydroelectricity expert brenda eaton , deputy minister to the premier our information is that the policy task force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process . additionally , the canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the 19 . 4 % us tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the states . a bc cabinet minister has made veiled threats to tie canadian energy exports to the united states to eliminating the softwood timber tariff . jean chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks , but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in northern bc along . bc hydro bc hydro chair larry bell is soft - peddling the bc liberals ' message of deregulation . coming under intense scrutiny , bell has already gone public to defend bc hydro ' s rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and powerex operations will not be deregulated . we noticed , however , that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off - which appears is indeed going forth . we believe that bc hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the short - to - medium term . two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are : trans - elect corporation , which has indicated it is watching the british columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in calgary ; and transconnect , which has been working with the rto - west group , which could eventually plug bc hydro ' s transmission systems into the rto west grid . bell has been talking about instituting a tiered - rate plan for bc ' s own energy - intensive industries , allowing energy - efficient plants to maintain their preferred rate , increasing rates for others . he is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in bc . however , bell has not been as hot on " clean coal " generation as neufeld , having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology , which has been economically and environmentally sound . strategically , hydro ' s export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border . from what we are seeing of the new chairman ' s position , it appears that bc hydro will attempt to sever the " feeling of entitlement " that bc ' s own energy - intensive industries have relied on . that is , hydro is snooping around the states for greener pastures after having had a taste of the california windfall last year . why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere ? bpa financial conditions to everyone ' s relief , bpa last week announced there would be no additional rate increase . in early august the agency had warned that its pre - third quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financial - based cost recovery adjustment clause ( fb crac ) , one of three cracs bpa and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices . the load - based ( lb ) crac has already driven a 46 percent rate increase , and the fb crac could have added another 4 . 5 mills . but the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger , so there will be no additional rate hike . additionally , we have also heard that bpa is still committed to spending roughly $ 186 million next year on fish and wildlife issues . ferc refunds although bpa has not issued an official statement , as a net supplier to california it is likely that bpa would be opposed to california ' s attempt to recoup over $ 1 . 5 billion in perceived overcharges from the pacific northwest . earlier this year , bpa responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled " bpa response to california iso study " on 13 april 2001 which maintained that its operations were above reproach . bpa will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from cal - iso ' s allegations . pacific northwest utilities and other energy - using entities , such as the city of tacoma and the port of seattle , also have joined in the fray to pursue $ 2 billion in perceived overcharges . the name of the game on the west coast is to say that you were a net importer , not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by ferc and the federal judge . everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers , not sellers . spill issues the power planning council has recommended spending more than $ 7 million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year . most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the john day river in oregon , with $ 1 . 6 million to pay for irrigation screens in the yakima river . the $ 7 million is in addition to $ 24 million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at main - stem dams . bpa had agreed to fund $ 9 . 3 million worth of the council ' s list . other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the south fork of idaho ' s clearwater river , spending $ 300 , 000 to improve fish passage in a tributary of oregon ' s umatilla river , and installing stream flow gauges in the entiat , okanogan and wenatchee rivers .

2	Subject: petrochem desk i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group . from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research . nelson

2	Subject: california update 9 - 19 - 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summary ? weekend developments of the socal mou ? socal & creditors weigh bankruptcy options california senate adjourns without a bailout vote as previously reported ( 9 / 14 ) , our prediction of sen . john burton discouraging support of the socal bailout did , in fact , play - out . burton ' s last minute vote polls indicated that there were only four senate democrats favoring the mou and an in extraordinary move , burton adjourned the senate without bothering to let ab 67 xx face a floor vote . the following outline the prevailing factors that led to burton ' s decision : ? reportedly , in addition to virtually no republican support , a coalition between at least 7 far left democrats and pro - business democrats convinced legislators not to vote on bailout legislation . ? at one point treasurer angelides pulled senator bowen aside and told her that the revenue bonds might sell with direct access after all . she then accused angelides of having lied to her about this in originally telling her that a bond sale would not be possible if direct access was included . ? both governor davis and treasurer angelides appear to have damaged their relationship with the senate . davis stated that he would not sign burton ' s legislation due to its ineffectiveness and additionally he would veto burton ' s bill separating the revenue streams for bond payment and payments for power . given the state of relations in sacramento , senators are likely to offer little or no cooperation on a bailout plan if davis calls another emergency session . see burton ' s response ( paraphrased ) : " i ' m going to be on jury duty , and i ' m not going to exercise my right to be excused . " he ' s also not going to ask people to come back and , as of last saturday ( 9 / 15 ) , most people on the business democrat and republican side at least were not planning on doing so . bankruptcy looms for socal it currently looks bleak for socal . davis and bryson have expended their political capital on this effort . the creditors ' committee is reportedly meeting to discuss how , when and by whom a filing should take place . edison executives have assured davis that the company will not file for bankruptcy and that its creditors will show restraint . however , it ' s unclear whether all of the utility ' s creditors will forebear on an involuntary bankruptcy filing . spokespersons for several large generators said friday ( 9 / 14 ) afternoon that they couldn ' t speculate on what their companies would do if the legislature failed to act on the edison rescue bill that night . davis aides say the governor would seek a reduced rescue package for edison when the legislature returns , but in the meantime , davis continues informal negotiations with legislators in effort to stave - off socal ' s bankruptcy .

2	Subject: good day good day . dear friend , as you read this , i don ? t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is hans leif jnr . a merchant in dubai , but i hail from norway . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . i am presently in a hospital in london . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give also to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria , malaysia and denmark . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars $ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 that i have with a fuditiary company . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside 10 % for you and for your time . god be with you . hans leif jnr . n / b : reply to hanslief @ mail 2 norway . com

2	Subject: microsoft update warning - january lst minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack " indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

2	Subject: re : uk portfolios and books setup in risktrac tanya the books were set up incorrectly when the spreadsheet feeds were implemented . this has since been corrected . currently the european risk trac numbers do not feed into the corporate reporting of var . the books should now contain gas exposures in uk gas and power in uk power and have no duplication . i have previously discussed with naveen and kirstee that it would be a good idea if we set up a regular meeting to projecct manage the implementation of european var numbers , from risk trac , into the daily reporting . if you have no objections i suggest we discuss this at the next weekly rac / research meeting . rgds oliver tanya tamarchenko 03 / 01 / 2001 21 : 05 to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect subject : re : uk portfolios and books setup in risktrac david and vince , in my e - mail below i pointed out to a inconsistency in the portfolio hierarchy for uk positions in risktrac that i found out , namely : some books ( for example elsb 1 and elsb 2 ) belong to uk - gas portfolio and to uk - power portfolio . i wanted to clarify this in order to reconcile positions in risktrac and in the spreadsheet . tanya . tanya tamarchenko 01 / 03 / 2001 02 : 09 pm to : naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron , matthew adams / corp / enron @ enron cc : rabi de / na / enron @ enron , jaesoo lew / na / enron @ enron , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : uk portfolios and books setup in risktrac naveen and matthew , i started looking systematically through uk positions and corresponding var numbers in the risckrac . i found a few inconsistencies so far . 1 . the portfolio elsb 1 - nbp has a book elsb 1 under it . the sum of delta positions for this book is 239 , 021 , 655 , the sum of gamma positions is - 211 , 031 , 450 . var for the portfolio elsb 1 - nbp is zero . the same refers to a few other portfolios , for example elsb 2 - nbp , elsb 3 - nbp , e 2 xxl - nbp . 2 . the portfolio elsbp 1 - ppp also has the book elsb 1 under it . this book contains the positions on pppwdl through pppwd 6 and pppwel through pppwe 4 . the same refers to the other books , for example elsb 2 . this looks messy . can someone in rac go over all the portfolios , all the corresponding books and curves in risktrac and make sure they are set up properly ? thank you , tanya .

( otc bb : apym ) is a credit card processing and merchant services company that provides credit card services to merchants and financial institutions in china . the company ' s objective is to be the first national provider of world - class third - party processing services in china to bankcard accepting merchants , issuers of bank credit cards , issuers of petroleum station retail cards , issuers of merchandise and grocery retail cards . the chinese market for credit cards , in terms of total credit card loans , is expected to grow over the next six years at a compounded annual rate of 88 % , from u . s . $ 300 million in 2003 to u . s . . $ 13 . 2 billion in 2009 . the population of china exceeds 1 . 26 billion and is growing at just under 1 % annually . however , gross domestic product ( gdp ) is growing by approximately 8 % , or eight times population growth , and as a result , a vibrant consumer society is starting to emerge in china . in late 2003 , china had 544 million domestic - use debit cards and 25 million credit cards , the majority restricted to domestic use . total cards issued grew 64 % in 2002 alone . the number of retailers who accept the cards has grown by 51 % per year . the total sum of transactions has increased by 76 % per year , and the number of card - issuing banks has increased from the initial four major state - owned commercial banks to over 20 banks . visa expects that 60 million credit card holders at the end of 2003 will grow on present trends to 200 million by 2010 . both beijing and shanghai have mandated that at least one - half of all merchants must accept credit or debit cards by the end of 2004 and 90 % by 2008 in order to be ready for foreign and domestic visitors at the 2008 beijing summer olympics and the 2010 shanghai world expo . demand for the company ' s services will remain substantial for many years to come conclusion : apym is an exciting special situation with enormous growth potential . asia payment addresses a virtually untapped credit card market in china that is projected to grow at an annual compounded rate of 88 % over the next six years . this fully - reporting company has a world - class management team that is well - connected and committed to major success . the current market cap of less than $ 3 . 5 million indicates that the shares are extremely undervalued relative to the company ' s high growth potential . we feel that our 12 month target price of $ 1 . 50 is very attainable and realistic ! within two to three years , apym could easily be trading in double digits . otc alert is a communications arm of otcreporter . com . otc alert is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accor dan ce with such , otc alert is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . otc alert is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e - mail alert contains or in corp orates by reference forward - looking statements , including certain information with respect to plans and strategies of the featured company . as such , any statements contained herein or in corp orated herein by reference that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward - looking statements . without limiting the foregoing , the words believe ( s ) , anticipate ( s ) , plan ( s ) , expect ( s ) , project ( s ) , forecast ( s ) will , estimate ( s ) , understand ( s ) or that by statements indicating certain actions may , could , or might occur and similar expressions which are intended to identify forward - looking statements . otc reporter has been compensated one hundred twenty five thousand free trade shares by a third party . there are a number of important factors that could cause actual events or actual results of the companies profiled herein to differ materially from these forecasts and projections as indicated by such forward - looking statements . statements that are not strictly historical are forward - looking within the meaning of the safe harbor clause of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . investors are cautioned that such forward - looking statements invoke risk and uncertainties that may cause the company ' s actual results to differ materially from such forward - looking statements . prior to making an investment , investors should consult with their financial advisor and visit edgar at www . sec . gov . otc alert p . o . box 273 rumson , nj 07760

2	Subject: marketpoint license agreement john / vince : i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people . as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire bundled product , which includes ? north american gas , short and long term ? north american electricity , short and long term ? world gas ? western european gas ? world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business . as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under the fully bundled price . i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward . ) i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business . if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar . our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar . thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later . thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted . dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc . 27121 adonna ct . los altos hills , ca 94022 ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com - license . doc

2	Subject: hanover gkh merger idea jeff , the following provides background information for your call with mel klein at gkh ( ref : the gkh memo you sent to me ) . over the past year , a number of groups / individuals have assessed the merits of acquiring gkh ' s interest in hanover and all have declined due to strategic as well as financial considerations . please give dick or me a call if you have any further questions . regards , brian - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by brian redmond / hou / ect on 04 / 09 / 2001 09 : 51 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - richard lydecker @ enron 04 / 06 / 2001 01 : 53 pm to : brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : hanover gkh merger idea the following is a quick review of the gkh merger analysis and the reasons we do not support it . it is also important to keep in mind that gkh is motivated to create a short - term exit from hanover due to the exigencies of their investment partnership expiration . klein ' s agenda is transparent . 1 . while hanover is a well - managed , growth company , it is not a " turnaround " or " special opportunity " situation for which application of enron ' s business model would promise the extraordinary returns required in order to justify an investment of $ 3 billion . 2 . as enron ' s stock price has declined , the attractiveness of using it as a currency in any acquisition has decreased . the pe decline also tends to make stock deals more dilutive to enron . 3 . the gkh analysis asserts $ 128 million in initial year synergies and cost savings . however , these benefits are largely predicated upon ( a ) use of the enron nol ( which is an asset enron already owns and can be applied to earnings from any acquisition ) - - $ 55 million and ( b ) speculative economies of scale , i . e . higher revenues and margins and significant sg & a reductions - - $ 38 million . the remaining $ 36 million of cited benefits relates to a proposed decapitalization of hanover from a proposed transfer of assets to a non - recourse trust ( although credit enhancement and operational guarantees would be required ) . achieving these benefits would require obtaining the best possible outcome on a number of accounting , financial and credit issues . however , even if all of these issues were resolved , the economic result is insufficient to justify the transaction . the gkh analysis does not consider transaction , transition or capital costs . 4 . after taking into account the capital expenditures required for hanover to achieve its aggressive growth targets , the company appears to be at best cash flow neutral or slightly cash flow negative for the three years presented in the gkh analysis ( even including all claimed synergies and cost savings ) . 5 . enron and hanover could achieve and share many of the synergistic benefits claimed for the merger in a properly structured joint venture . ( however , this would still require finding an internal enron " sponsor " to assume ownership of the relationship ) . 6 . much of hanover ' s growth in the future is predicated upon an aggressive expansion and expenditure program internationally . given enron ' s domestic opportunities , this international orientation in a non - core business is inconsistent with our present strategy . 7 . like gkh , enron has been a seller of our hanover position . an abrupt reversal of strategies could create significant uncertainties and confusion on the street about enron ' s strategic direction . additional background to demonstrate the magnitude of the limitations of the gkh analysis with respect to increasing enron ' s eps : 1 . if pooling of interest accounting is available , any acquisition enron makes of any company that has a lower pe ratio than enron is accretive to enron ' s eps . there is nothing " remarkable " about this , it is simple mathematics . 2 . if purchase accounting is required , even if the entire purchase price were accounted as " goodwill " and never amortized , this would only replicate the results of pooling of interest . however , in actuality , a significant proportion of the purchase price would have to be allocated to assets ( tangible and intangible such as contracts ) which would produce additional depreciation and amortization expense not mentioned in the gkh analysis . 3 . the largest single " synergy " by far in the gkh analysis is usage of enron ' s nol to shield hanover ' s taxable earnings . enron can obtain the benefit of its nol by acquiring any profitable company . gm recorded about $ 3 . 4 billion in income tax expense last year which would offer even greater opportunity to utilitize this enron asset . 4 . the gkh analysis is totally silent with respect to the biggest single immediate risk of a transaction , i . e . the potential negative impact on enron ' s own pe . dick

2	Subject: organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron wind , will report to cliff . corporate staff we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources , government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . committee structure in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be drawing on this group to lead company -

2	Subject: urgent reply . from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon chambers & associates no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria private email address ( @ shymail . com ) dear i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became necessary for me to seek your assistance . i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company ) here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he tendered to the security company while opening the account . therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum given to me confiscate the account . according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my way . since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple . i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate that will be required on documentation . first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information : your full names . contact address . telephone / fax numbers . with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking 60 % . all i require is your honest co -

2	Subject: alliance update note : alliance says they are flowing 40 - 50 % of capacity at this time ( 400 - 500 mmbtu / d hitting the chicago market ) . it sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the aux sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through . some predictors are saying the delay may get longer . alliance service delay extended to end of november alliance pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in - service date will have to be delayed for the third time , this time until the end of november , because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync . the 1 , 900 - mile project originally was supposed to be in service oct . 1 . " normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line , " says alliance ceo norm gish . " however , periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the aux sable liquid products processing facility near chicago . " a spokesman said the debris included " bits of foam " that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing . the complexity of the alliance pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service . the pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1 . 325 bcf / d of natural gas from british columbia and northern alberta through 1 , 900 miles of pipe to the aux sable liquids extraction plant near chicago . the pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown calgary control room . alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines : a physical pipe , a paper pipe and an e - pipe , which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year . " it ' s a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent , for it to work , they all have to work together . " regardless of the delay , however , alliance already is flowing a large amount of gas into the chicago market . " at this point in our commissioning activities , the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50 % of capacity . we expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm delivery capacity of 37 . 5 million cubic meters ( 1 . 325 bcf ) per day prior to the end of november .

2	Subject: fw : analysis of orion power acquisition ; maintaining belowconse nsus estimates ; reducing target price - - - - - original message - - - - - from : stein , neil [ mailto : neil . stein @ csfb . com ] sent : friday , september 28 , 2001 7 : 02 am to : undisclosed - recipients subject : rri : analysis of orion power acquisition ; maintaining belowconse nsus estimates ; reducing target price > good morning , attached , please find our fc note on reliant resources . summary : 1 . on september 27 , 2001 , rri announced it would acquire orion power for $ 26 . 80 in an all - cash transaction . ? 2 . in our view this deal has very positive implications for the sector . the purchase price is essentially in - line with our estimate of the private market value of orn ' s asset portfolio ( $ 26 . 83 ) . overall , the deal gives us addition confidence in our valuation framework and reinforces our view that valuations in the sector are extremely attractive . ? 3 . rri is leaving unchanged its 2002 eps guidance of $ 2 . 05 - $ 2 . 15 . in doing so , rri noted that the earnings contribution from this deal ( + $ 0 . 30 ) will offset the negative impact of sluggish conditions in the western power markets . ? 4 . our 2001 and 2002 eps estimates remain unchanged at $ 1 . 62 and $ 1 . 95 . our 2002 estimate continues to be below company guidance , giving us comfort in our forecast . ? 5 . importantly , for 2002 rri ' s western generation assets are currently less than 50 % hedged , which is well below the company ' s peers including cpn ( strong buy , $ 19 . 75 ) and mir ( buy , $ 19 . 60 ) . as such , the company is relatively more exposed to commodity price volatility in that region of the country . 6 . we are reducing our target price to $ 30 from $ 40 . we derive this valuation from our discounted cash flow ( dcf ) analysis , which employs an 11 . 4 % discount rate . our revised target price reflects : 1 . the $ 2 . 9 billion acquisition expenditure ; 2 . the $ 1 . 8 billion of assumed net debt ; 3 . the incremental earnings and synergies associated with the deal ; and , 4 . the earnings shortfall at rri ' s western operations and slower overall growth prospects for the business . regards , neil stein 212 / 325 - 4217 this message is for the named person ' s use only . it may contain confidential , proprietary or legally privileged information . no confidentiality or privilege is waived or lost by any mistransmission . if you receive this message in error , please immediately delete it and all copies of it from your system , destroy any hard copies of it and notify the sender . you must not , directly or indirectly , use , disclose , distribute , print , or copy any part of this message if you are not the intended recipient . credit suisse group and each of its subsidiaries each reserve the right to monitor all e - mail communications through its networks . any views expressed in this message are those of the individual sender , except where the message states otherwise and the sender is authorised to state them to be the views of any such entity . unless otherwise stated , any pricing information given in this message is indicative only , is subject to change and does not constitute an offer to deal at any price quoted . any reference to the terms of executed transactions should be treated as preliminary only and subject to our formal written confirmation .

' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb . the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue " notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power " was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said . according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra  , s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : " the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . " while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a " protest payment " of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . " we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh " , a senior mseb official said . " we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members " , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept " protest payments " anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the " purported protest or reservation " . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s " enabling resolution " did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . " this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting " , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  * like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  * even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a  +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .  +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  , s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , " bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of " interested party " . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . " we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , " he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as " unfortunate " . " we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision " , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb . " if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , " the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a " protest payment " of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8 the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron  , s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs  & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8 mid day ' dpc may not wind up ' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , " bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . " in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , " we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . " deshmukh had earlier said , " we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . " enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , " i am not going to give any comment . " mid day , april 27 , 2001 enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . " we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , " the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government " is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . " mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company . " renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , " deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , 2001 ' enron ' s on ! ' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . " enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , " he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , " let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . " when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . " it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , " he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .

" believe me , no matter where you believe those " feelings " come from , i thank every day that i had that feeling . i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be doing had i not . read on . it ' s true . every word of it . it is legal . i checked . simply because you are buying and selling something of value . as seen on national tv : making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home . thanks to the computer age and the internet ! be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say " bull " , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are " absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can ' follow the simple instructions ' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost " . due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained , it is currently working better than ever . this is what one had to say : " thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received a total $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in .

   you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost $ 5 x 5  $ 25 . 00 . within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it will not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends ' / relatives ' names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical to your success . * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but let ' s just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s 100 people who responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each  $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total  $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report .            available reports                     the reason for the " cash " is not because this is illegal or somehow " wrong " . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : " the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net " order report # 1 from : robert borowczyk ul . j . olbrachta 118 c m . 28 01 - 373 warsaw poland report # 2 : " the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net " order report # 2 from : mohammad faraziyan engelbertstr . 25 40233 dsseldorf germany report # 3 : " secret to multilevel marketing on the net " order report # 3 from : luis pastor apartado 81 48080 bilbao spain report # 4 : " how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net " order report # 4 from : ali reza auf den holln 68 44894 bochum germany report # 5 : " how to send out one million emails for free " order report # 5 from : j . siden krondikesvgen 54 a 83147 stersund sweden $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :    if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do .    after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now !

" mitchell wolf m . d . , chicago , illinois " not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative as i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back . i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders . i made $ 319 , 210 . 00 in the first 12 weeks . the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live . there simply isn ' t a better investment with a faster return and so big .

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 20 ol have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( " gccc " ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the " act " ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words " plan , " " confident that , " " believe , " " scheduled , " " expect , " or " intend to , " and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 5 o we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . oo we feel this is our best pick since december of 20 o 4 ! ! please watch this one trade tuesday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

this is critical to your success . * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but let ' s just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s 100 people who responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each  $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total  $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report .            available reports                     the reason for the " cash " is not because this is illegal or somehow " wrong " . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : " the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net " order report # : 1 from rui sousa santos p . o . box 132 taylors lakes vic 3038 australia report # 2 : " the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net " order report # 2 from : richard moulton p . o . box 82 hot springs , mt 59845 usa report # 3 : " secret to multilevel marketing on the net " order report # 3 from : j . siden krondikesvdgen 54 a 83147 vstersund sweden report # 4 : " how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net " order report # 4 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 5 : " how to send out one million emails for free " order report # 5 from : j . johns p . o . box 277806 sacramento , ca 95827 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :    if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do .    after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now !
