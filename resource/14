2	Subject: business partnership ( urgent / confidential ) mr . vincent nnaji , standard trust bank ltd , lagos , nigeria . dear sir , i am mr . vincent nnaji , bank manager of standard trust bank , lagos , nigeria . i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you . on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant foreign contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation mr . james herbert made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 20 m ( twenty million united states dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 20 m has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe - keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $ 1 m . i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney . all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple . i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes . the money will be shared in the ratio of 70 % for me and 25 % for you and 5 % will take care of all expenses . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately via my private email address . upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest . thanks and regards , mr . vincent nnaji .

2	Subject: re : list of topn 50 counterparties thanks . will talk with you tomorrow . one issue that should be discussed is the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today . my guess is that any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they will want to use as well as credit department needs . and so sending out language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder . this is only a timing issue i think but is important nonetheless .

( legal ) sent : wednesday , november 07 , 2001 7 : 30 pm to : belden , tim cc : sager , elizabeth ; bradford , william s . ; ngo , tracy subject : update on srp margin call importance : high tim , as you know , srp made a margin call to epmi on monday , by letter , seeking $ 5 . 5 million in margin under a " one - off " contract . tracy and i sent a letter back on tuesday , arguing that the contract does not permit srp to call for additional margin unless ene is downgraded to junk status . srp responded to our letter this afternoon . predictably , srp disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin . srp says that it will treat our failure to post $ 5 . 5 million by monday , november 12 , in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit , as an event of default and will terminate the contract . if this happens , epmi would have to make a payment of $ 5 . 5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from srp . as you know , tracy and i strongly believe that the contract does not support srp ' s right to call for margin at this time . however , the contract is not perfect ( they drafted it , after all ) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position . i recommend that we treat the srp - epmi dispute regarding the margining criteria under this agreement as a " dispute " under section 17 . disputes are first submitted to authorized representatives ( each company designates an authorized representative ) to resolve . if the authorized representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days , then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at srp ( the " executives " ) . the executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue . if the executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days , then both parties can choose arbitration , or either party can take the matter to court . in summary , best case , this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate / litigate the issue . otherwise , we better prepare to post collateral monday . if you want to handle this matter by taking the " dispute " route , i should send a letter out tomorrow to srp giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract ' s " dispute " provisions . steve ( i should also mention that tracy has informed me that srp plans to issue a margin call on our wspp contracts ( approximately $ 4 . 5 million ) as soon as it calculates the amount due . )

2	Subject: overview of investor conference call today , enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company . here ' s an update of what we discussed during the call . we told investors that we ' re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence . our focus remains on our credit quality , balance sheet and liquidity , which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses . it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today . here ' s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation : - - in hindsight , we definitely made some very bad investments in our non - core businesses over the past several years . those include investments in azurix , india and brazil . they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments ; - - because of these bad investments , we ' ve become over - leveraged as a company . the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet ; - - we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence , which has been very damaging ; - - we ' ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard - to - understand financial and operating disclosures ; and - - on top of it all , we discovered errors in our financial statements , as discussed in our 8 - k filing last week , that required a restatement of previously reported earnings . we ' ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas : core businesses , non - core businesses , and businesses under review . core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company . they ' re our competitive advantage . these include : - - natural gas pipeline businesses ; - - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ; - - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and - - coal businesses in north america and europe . the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it ' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 . i also remain optimistic that the actions we ' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships . non - core businesses our non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal . we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals . businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation . reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available . credit rating / 10 - q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows : - - moody ' s at baa 3 " under review for further downgrade " - - fitch at bbb - " evolving status " - - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 . in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered " participants in the solicitation " of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .

2	Subject: california update - - 10 . 02 . 01 : puc turns down davis ' proposed rate agreement with dwr in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event , the california puc today voted down davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc . the vote was 4 - 1 , with the two republicans voting with davis ' hand - picked appointees lynch and wood . davis ' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another davis appointee - - geoff brown - - who made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve davis ' proposed rate agreement . what is davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc ? it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers . it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs , no questions asked . what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject davis ' proposal ? with the vote , it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the dwr power contracts . the political pressure to re - negotiate - - or break - - the dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably . it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months . under the structure devised by davis , the revenues flowing from the cpuc / dwr rate agreement would be used to both 1 ) pay for the dwr power contracts and 2 ) service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california ' s general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january . in short , there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds . safe to say that today ' s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis , and left his approach to " solving " california electricity crisis in shambles . what next ? a broad left - right coalition of energy interests supported a bill ( 18 xx ) that passed the legislature with broad bi - partisan support . the bill would create a " dedicated rate component " on every customers bill to service the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue . proponents of the bill - - and just about everyone else - - argue that the " dedicated rate component " is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget . the bill is silent , however , on how california would pay for the dwr contracts , and the bill ' s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result . all four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill . the left - right coalition ( from nader types to oil companies ) is also working hard to get davis to sign it . davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel . given today ' s vote , however , davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid . update on edison bailout still appears that chances are very small that edison and davis will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an edison bailout when it returns for another " special " session next tuesday . if you have any questions , just let us know . best , jeff

2	Subject: pancanadian buys montana power note : this article gives some of the strategy and economics of the purchase of montana power by pan canadian . we will look at the oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipe - - with the switch in ownership , they may be receptive to strategy changes . lorna pancanadian says montana power purchase ' beautiful fit ' to extend what it sees as dominance in canada ' s natural gas market and to boost its production by 10 % , pancanadian petroleum ltd . yesterday agreed to purchase montana power co . for $ 475 million . the properties will extend pancanadian ' s existing shallow gas properties in southern alberta into northern montana , adding 94 mmcf / d and 3 , 800 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids . the acquisition will give pancanadian properties in alberta , montana , colorado , oklahoma and wyoming , along with three gas pipelines linking alberta and saskatchewan to montana . " we have a focus on natural gas , " said ceo david tuer during a conference call yesterday in calgary . " this is clearly our future . it is difficult to put any negative on this ( acquisition ) and it ' s likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future . " montana power ' s production is more than 90 % natural gas and associated liquids , and the acquisition substantially extends pancanadian ' s land and infrastructure , allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the alberta - montana border . " the montana power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas , " tuer said . " the potential in these assets is significant , and over the next few years , we will add substantially to pancanadian ' s daily natural gas production . " tuer said that the acquisition extends the company ' s dominance in shallow gas , and called montana power a " beautiful fit with pancanadian ' s gas strategy , land position and technological capability . " pancanadian ' s newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 bcf and 20 mm barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one - half probable basis , said officials . production and reserves account for $ 520 million of the purchase price , while the remainder is made up of $ 135 million for the midstream and marketing assets , $ 40 million for the undeveloped land ( about 600 , 000 acres ) , and $ 7 million of working capital . tuer said the company was paying 77 cents / mcfe of proven and on - half probable reserves . the price for daily flowing production , based on a 6 : 1 ration of gas to boe is $ 4 , 450 / mcfe , or $ 26 , 710 / boe . along with the added alberta and montana properties , pancanadian also picks up some land in colorado ' s denver basin , which now produces about 31 mmcf / d . other land that is part of the sale is located in the anadarko basin of oklahoma and the green river basin of wyoming . three natural gas pipelines that cross from montana into alberta and saskatchewan also are included . the pipelines allow direct access to the u . s . markets for southern alberta and saskatchewan gas , and serve more than 1 . 2 million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands , with most of it concentrated in parcels that span the canada - montana border . midstream assets that go to pancanadian include a natural gas marketing company in butte , mt , along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in colorado . the fort lupton , co plant processes more than 60 mmcf / d and 5 , 500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate . in all , the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1 . 2 million net acres , or 1 . 7 million gross acres , said pancanadian . " montana power fit us like a glove , " tuer said during the conference call . he said the acquisition will help pancanadian to remain " best of class " for what it does . " it makes our sandbox that much bigger . " the acquisition , which is expected to close around oct . 31 , will increase both pancanadian ' s net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years , said tuer . the added gas production will immediately increase the company ' s natural gas , as a percentage of total production , to 58 % , based on a 6 : 1 ratio of gas to boe . about 25 % of the natural gas being acquired from montana power now is being sold to montana power utilities for $ 1 . 50 to $ 1 . 60 mmcf until july 2002 , and because it ' s priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good . " as that contract expires , there ' s a lot of potential from the price in this transaction , " tuer said . and what ' s to become of montana power ? earlier this year , the 88 - year - old company , headquartered in butte , announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses . by selling its coal production , natural gas transmission and distribution , independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses , it plans to reinvest the proceeds in touch america , a fiber optics and telecommunications business , which is also a subsidiary of montana power . " the process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust , and we are delighted with the result , " said montana power ceo robert p . gannon . " we believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergy ' s exist between the purchased companies and pan canadian . " he noted that montana power has had a canadian presence for almost 50 years . pancanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division , which now employs about 170 . pancanadian plans to maintain a regional office in butte , invest in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production . there was no word on whether any jobs would be lost . - -

" it will be another good example of how the market does work . . . it will regain people ' s confidence in the market , " said guy america , vice president for credit derivatives at j . p . morgan chase in london . image problem however , other dealers predicted a messy conclusion . " the impact is clearly a loss of confidence in the credit derivative market overall , " said a default swaps trader with a european bank . the most recent corporate failure to trigger a large number of default swaps , that of u . k . rail operator railtrack , resulted in banks calling in lawyers to see if they had to pay out on certain obligations . dealers said enron was an actively traded name in the default swaps market , mainly in new york . as a privately negotiated market , it is difficult to get accurate figures for the value of contracts outstanding on enron , however , dealers said well over a billion dollars of protection on enron had been written . " ( it was ) one of the benchmark names for the us credit ( derivative market ) . . . so you can guess that a lot of people were involved in this credit through default swaps , " said the european bank trader . uncertain credit insurance potentially more damaging for the credit derivatives market is the failure of enron credit . the subsidiary specialised in selling credit risk mitigation tools to companies who wanted to hedge against customers going bankrupt and failing to pay . if end - users now find the derivatives they bought no longer give them the level of credit protection they expected , it may make it harder for banks in future to convince more of their customers to start using the tools . on the back of demand from end - users , enron credit was active in the inter - dealer default swaps market . a filing for bankruptcy by enron corp . could trigger settlement on all the contracts into which enron credit entered . this would involve a large number of contracts and dealers say this would be concentrated among the limited circle of banks , mainly enron corp . s bank lenders , which accepted enron credit as a dealing counterparty . " it was not broadly accepted as a counterparty , " said one dealer , who added that he hadn ' t seen the firm in the market since october . lenders face biggest loss however , most dealers concur that any losses the banks might incur on credit derivatives contracts would be small compared to potential lending losses . " counterparty losses would be dwarfed by direct lending exposure , " said the head of credit derivatives at a euroepan bank . dealers said some banks had looked at taking on the enron credit trading book but that this now looked unlikely . " the banks that were involved in trying to rescue the bank recently . . were also involved in overlooking their credit book and potentially making a bid to take it into their own book , " said one trader . shares in enron fell 85 percent to 61 cents after a rescue deal by smaller rival dynegy inc fell apart on wednesday . on thursday the company said it may not pay previously declared dividends . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . uk : enron europe splits from u . s . parent . 11 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - enron ' s european business said on thursday it has been operating separately from its u . s . parent company since wednesday when headquarters in houston stopped cash tranfers to the european trading business . accountants in london were appointed administrators on thursday to the european operation of crisis - hit enron .

" they haven ' t had any defaults yet . but nobody ' s trading with them at the moment , " a dealer at a major oil company which had trading links with enron said . dealers said enron had been missing from the european oil otc market for over a week and many companies had stopped trading with them a month ago as signs emerged of financial difficulties at america ' s largest energy trader . in the oil market , enron ' s trading activities extended right across the petroleum product chain as well as various brent crude derivatives contracts . they said the dated to front line ( dfl ) brent contract , which balances the risk of dated brent against the front - month ipe futures contract , had seen substantial activity on thursday amid speculation that some players had moved to square off their positions against exposures to enron . " it ' s a case of closing up positions , " a brent trader said . dealers said enron was believed to have closed positions on london ' s international petroleum exchange . the ipe declined comment . the dealers said a shortlived price spike late on wednesday on ipe and nymex crude oil and nymex natural gas futures markets suggested a brief session of short covering . " there was a short spell when the natural gas market was strengthening and wti moved up . one broker was doing most of the buying and most people thought he was covering for enron . but the market came straight back down , " said one futures dealer . an spokeswoman for the ipe said its compliance department was looking at enron ' s positions on the market and had been talking with financial services authority and clearing house .

" the dollar is a little heavy across the board , " said robert sinche , head of global currency strategy at citibank in new york . " unless you get something completely outrageous , it looks likely to remain that way . " the dollar has fallen below key support levels against both the euro and the yen , as traders moved to liquidate a spate of long dollar positions . while the enron situation doesn ' t have a direct effect on foreign exchange markets , analysts said that it wasn ' t helping dollar sentiment . " the market was ripe for an unwinding of long dollar positions , " said mr . sinche . " enron . . . is the kind of situation that just acts as a catalyst . " as is often the case , the euro ' s gains appeared to be more a result of pessimism towards the u . s . rather than any optimism about the euro zone . the market largely shrugged off third quarter euro - zone gross domestic product data earlier thursday which came in exactly as expected : up 0 . 1 % on the quarter and 1 . 3 % on the year . the dollar ' s direction thursday will also be influenced by u . s . shares , with prospects for a marked rebound looking slim in the wake of the enron woes . analysts said a sustained move above the 89 cent level could set the euro up for a test of 89 . 45 cents and then 90 cents , which is expected to offer more formidable resistance . its difficulty in making a concerted push for 90 cents is probably down to the potential outflows related to the morgan stanley capital international indexes rebalancing , and the deutsche telekom / voicestream deal . the first phase of the new msci weightings comes into effect friday , and should involve fund managers reducing their exposure to euro zone equities . so far , this seems to have been discounted , although it could still help to keep a lid on the euro . the lockup period for voicestream shareholders to keep hold of their deutsche telekom shares expires dec . 1 , which could prompt them to offload the stock , in effect resulting in sizable euro - zone outflows . benign inflation data from switzerland out earlier thursday - up only 0 . 3 % in november on the year - has paved the way for the swiss national bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting dec . 7 . " with the market looking only for a rate cut of 25 basis points , we would expect the swiss franc to remain capped around current levels , " said ubs warburg analysts . grainne mccarthy of dow jones newswires contributed to this article copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . electrabel says exposure to enron " insignificant " 11 / 29 / 2001 dow jones international news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 331 - 4017 - 1740 ; sarah . wachter @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones halts trading with enron 11 / 29 / 2001 pr newswire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire ) charlotte , n . c . , nov . 29 / prnewswire / - - duke energy ( nyse : duk ) today expressed confidence in the vitality of the energy sector and said it had taken steps to manage its exposure during the very serious difficulties being experienced by enron , including instituting a trading halt .

" the market is larger than any one player and is very resilient . enron ' s role and activities in the energy market have significantly diminished over the past several weeks . and , market liquidity is provided by many active trading and marketing companies that have effective risk management practices and sound capitalizations , " osborne noted . " we at duke energy are committed to our customers and fulfilling our contracts and services without disruption . we also continue to see strong growth opportunities ahead and are extremely confident in our ability to achieve or exceed our financial targets this year and next , " osborne said . the company remains fully committed to deliver earnings growth within its stated guidance of 10 percent to 15 percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of $ 2 . 10 in 2000 . based on the strong results reported for the first three quarters of this year , duke energy had previously communicated it will likely exceed 15 percent earnings growth in 2001 . yesterday ' s developments do not change that view . duke energy , a diversified multinational energy company , creates value for customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and expertise . duke energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and electric supply , delivery and trading businesses - - generating revenues of more than $ 49 billion in 2000 . duke energy , headquartered in charlotte , n . c . , is a fortune 100 company traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol duk . more information about the company is available on the internet at : www . duke - energy . com . contact : jennifer hillings epstein of duke energy , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 1221 , or 24 - hour , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 8333 . make your opinion count - click here / contact : jennifer hillings epstein of duke energy , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 1221 , or 24 - hour , + 1 - 704 - 382 - 8333 / 09 : 30 est copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dominion reports that enron exposure not expected to affect earnings forecast 11 / 29 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) richmond , va . - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 29 , 2001 - - dominion ( nyse : d ) said today that it has pre - tax credit exposure to enron of $ 11 million for past sales . dominion said it has forward commodity sales contracts with enron that represent an exposure of less than 5 percent of earnings , based on today ' s forward prices . dominion reaffirmed its public operating earnings per share targets of $ 4 . 15 or better in 2001 , $ 4 . 90 to $ 4 . 95 in 2002 and 10 percent annual earnings growth after 2002 . dominion is one of the nation ' s largest producers of natural gas and power . contact : dominion , richmond media : mark lazenby , 804 / 819 - 2042 hunter applewhite , 804 / 819 - 2043 or analysts : tom wohlfarth , 804 / 819 - 2150 suzette mata , 804 / 819 - 2154 09 : 06 est november 29 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . s & p lwrs rtg on yosemite ' s 2000 - a linked enron notes 11 / 29 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) london - - ( business wire ) - - standard & poor ' s - - nov . 29 , 2001 - - standard & poor ' s today lowered its rating on the gbp 200 million 8 . 75 % series 2000 - a linked enron obligations issued by yosemite securities co . ltd . to ' b - ' from ' bbb - ' . concurrently , the ratings have been placed on creditwatch with developing implications . the rating action reflects the nov . 28 , 2001 downgrade of enron corp . - - which supports yosemite securities co . - - which was prompted by standard & poor ' s concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynergy inc . and the liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . yosemite securities ' creditwatch developing situation reflects the possibility that enron corp .

last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on the table . mark mcgwire , the home - run - hitting baseball player for st . louis , retired . and he let it be known that he never signed a two - year , $ 30 million contract his agent negotiated last spring . why ? because he wanted to find out if his injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before . it didn ' t , and he decided he wasn ' t worth that kind of money . then ken lay , chairman of enron corp . , said he won ' t take the $ 60 . 6 million he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when enron is sold to dynegy corp . of course , neither mcgwire nor lay will ever have to consider my fallback retirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket , carrying them to the car and hoping for a big tip . still , it was a class act on both their parts . mcgwire only hit . 187 last season , well below his lifetime average . and lay ? well , let ' s say that rarely in the history of american capitalism has a company sunk as fast as enron . remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $ 82 a share . now it ' s hovering in the single - digit level , and enron is being forced to sell itself to a smaller rival . the stock price incentive how did enron get into this position ? put the blame on the company ' s relentless drive to push up its stock price . and a big reason for that push comes from the way american companies compensate top executives . in the last couple of decades , executive compensation has soared . the average chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary , bonuses and stock options as the average factory worker . apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren ' t relevant . most of the money top executives receive doesn ' t come from base pay or bonuses but from stock options . such options usually work this way . executives are given hundreds or thousands of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future date . the sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the stock on the date the options were granted . if the stock increases past the exercise price in the option , the executive can buy the stock and then sell it , making big bucks . it the stock has dropped below the option price - it ' s underwater , in the jargon - then those options are worthless . granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareholders , those who favor this sort of incentive say . and that ' s true , if you talking about in - and - out traders . but it ' s not true if we ' re looking out for the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term . keeping the debt hidden keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down enron . to hype the stock , enron ' s execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel its amazing growth and some of its dicier investments , in partnerships . enron was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals . that way it could move a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership . that , in turn , made the company ' s earnings look better . when enron ' s executives finally fessed up , they had to write down their profits over the past few years by 20 percent . but the real irony here is that 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money . but by that time , the majority of shareholders simply had no faith in enron ' s bookkeeping . now look at lay ' s compensation . in 1999 he exercised stock options and made $ 44 million on them . in 2000 , sales of options brought him $ 123 million , and this year about $ 26 million , according to a study published by bloomberg news . was lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitable ? i don ' t think so . he was simply following the latest fad in corporate governance . he was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders . the shareholders were happy with that high stock price . nobody - besides some stock analysts - complained about enron ' s often - impenetrable bookkeeping until that stock price started to fall . would enron ' s bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fewer stock options ? maybe . fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys . and no one would want that job if he were only going to make $ 10 million a year instead of $ 100 million . just kidding . copyright ?

' ' these very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities , ' ' said tina vital , an oil and gas analyst at standard & poor ' s , who recommends a broad group of integrated oil companies , including exxon mobil , chevrontexaco , royal dutch / shell , bp and totalfinaelf . ' ' they have excellent management , a top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors , ' ' she said , provided that investors are patient and can bear short - term swings . last week ' s price declines were set off by russian oil companies ' refusal to accept demands by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries for big production cuts . they were a reminder that the sector is extremely volatile . ' ' oil could go to $ 10 a barrel short term , ' ' she said , but there is no certainty of that . the oil producers could reach an agreement by january , sending prices upward . over the long term , she expects to see production cuts . demand for energy has grown only 0 . 5 percent this year , and prices have been declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline - - as drivers have seen at the gas pump . west texas intermediate crude closed friday at $ 18 . 03 on the new york mercantile exchange , up 58 cents from its thursday close , the lowest since june 1999 . but an economic recovery , expected by late 2002 , could cause demand to pick up , analysts say . as oil prices have dropped , so have the prices of most oil stocks , but not as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000 . over that period , the s . & p . energy index has lost 8 percent , while the s . & p . 500 - stock index is down 23 percent . a report issued last week by the energy department said that while the sept . 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country ' s economic slowdown , ' ' they are not expected to result in any long - term volatility in energy markets . ' ' the report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1 . 7 percent a year through 2020 , instead of the 1 . 2 percent predicted only a year ago . its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment , and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks . while they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead , other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term . l . bruce lanni , senior oil analyst at a . g . edwards his 12 - month target is $ 34 . ' ' we remain confident , ' ' he said , ' ' that the company ' s annual oil and gas production should grow by about 4 percent , on average , over the next several years . ' ' conoco ' s debt , at 55 percent of capital , is relatively high , but he expects the company ' s strong cash flow - - it equaled $ 5 . 33 a share last year - - to reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003 . the company ' s after - tax interest cost is only 3 . 5 percent , he said . mr . lanni also favors kerr - mcgee , a natural gas exploration and production company , and bp , calling both undervalued . he regards exxon mobil , royal dutch / shell and chevrontexaco as fully priced , so he is not recommending buying them now . ' ' if you own them , hold them , ' ' he said . william featherston , executive director and an oil and gas exploration analyst at ubs warburg , said he felt ' ' near - term caution but medium - term optimism for sustainably higher ' ' natural gas prices . he said he would encourage investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies over the next two months . his top picks are apache , kerr - mcgee and eog resources . such stocks are highly volatile , he said . they are ' ' trading - oriented vehicles , and short - term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the most attractive entry and exit points , ' ' he said . ' ' while natural gas prices declined throughout most of this year , prices rose at a startling pace , from $ 1 . 75 per million cubic feet at the end of september to over $ 3 per million cubic feet within weeks . ' ' he cited three reasons for the price rally : a decline in gas surpluses , predictions of a colder - than - normal winter and what he has called ' ' pathetic third - quarter natural gas production , ' ' despite record drilling activity . the tangled finances of the enron corporation were also a factor in the recent price increase for natural gas futures , he said . enron , which marketed 25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas , or more than 40 percent of the nation ' s demand , is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and announced a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from deals with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer . it also reported a third - quarter loss and restated earlier earnings . enron has agreed to be taken over by dynegy , a smaller rival , for about $ 9 billion in stock . dynegy is also assuming about $ 13 billion in debt . anxiety over whether the enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or have other market repercussions led to an increase in prices . while it is ' ' difficult to quantify the enron factor , ' ' mr . featherston said , the short - term effects on natural gas prices seem to be over . other factors , of course , could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors over the next several months . the status of the war against terrorism , president bush ' s decision to fill the strategic petroleum reserve , thus helping opec in reducing excess global capacity , and a united nations review of the food - for - oil deal with iraq expected in december could each have a significant impact on battered oil prices . nevertheless , ms . vital said , for the long term , energy will probably be in short supply , and new sources must be developed . so she also likes the prospects of two drilling companies , noble drilling and nabors industries . both took a beating last week , along with the oil companies , so again she sees buying opportunities . bern fleming , portfolio manager of the axp utilities income fund in minneapolis , who has stakes in dynegy , duke energy and dominion resources , said all three had good prospects for growth , thanks to a mix of assets , ' ' management i respect and solid business plans .

it will take months , if not years , to untangle the details , but it is clear that the main culprit was greed , closely followed by hubris . not too many years ago enron was a small , struggling , gas pipeline company in houston . as deregulation spread to more and more states , enron began acquiring pipelines , gas producers and utilities . it also acquired friends in high places , especially the bush family and their key political advisers . and , it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it . enron sold many of its generating plants and became the biggest " power broker " in the nation . though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked california consumers of tens of billions of dollars , enron was one of the first power barons to take advantage of california ' s flawed deregulation law - - virtually written by in - state and out - of - state utility companies . the california fiasco soured ( probably ) most americans on utility deregulation , but enron was not singled out for calumny , and management saw no reason to examine its business ethics . contrarywise . management had visions of even greater profits , which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders . the chief financial officer and other high - ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary partnerships which made deals with enron . i do not understand the details of these arrangements , but neither do independent accountants , the securities and exchange commission or congressional investigators . it does seem clear that the enron insiders made millions for themselves . enron acknowledges , without explaining , that stockholder equity dropped $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overstated profits by some $ 600 million . whether this was by design or by mistake is in dispute , but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the confidence of investors . so much for greed . back to hubris . it seems not unlikely that enron ' s leaders felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner - cutting because they had friends in high places . the chief executive , kenneth l . lay , was and is a personal friend of george w . bush and has easy access to the white house . for many months after the new administration took office , karl rove , bush ' s top political strategist , owned enron stock valued at $ 100 , 000 to $ 250 , 000 , and sold it only after he had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gains tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest . lawrence lindsey , the president ' s chief economic coordinator , and i . lewis libby , vice president cheney ' s chief of staff , owned stock in enron , and lindsey was paid $ 50 , 000 last year as a consultant for enron . enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to bush ' s four political campaigns - - one ( unsuccessful ) for congress , two for governor and one for president . in 2000 , enron and its employees gave $ 113 , 000 to bush ' s campaign , $ 250 , 000 to the republican national committee , and $ 300 , 000 to the presidential inauguration committee . cabinet appointments affecting energy policy , key sub - cabinet appointments , administration action or inaction in the california energy mess , and the overall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favorable to the interests of enron . and now a couple of questions : is it possible the unusual financial maneuvers by enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy texas oilmen in the bush administration ? were those of them with heavy investments in enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company ? was enron right in thinking its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand ? or , in light of our preoccupation with terrorism , will the enron case get much attention from the federal government ? or from voters ? waldo proffitt is the former editor of the herald - tribune . copyright ?

" many americans , contemplating the losses they ' ve suffered this year in the stock market , might say there was nothing " best " about what happened to them - - in fact , nothing good at all , perhaps other than that it might have been worse . with share prices on the rise again , the damage to portfolios has been lessened . even so , stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks to keep this from being the market ' s worst calendar year since 1977 . the blue - chip standard & poor ' s 500 index rose 1 . 6 % last week , but it ' s still down 13 . 8 % year to date . yet those losses , while certainly not trivial ( especially when they ' re yours ) , can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year ' s experiences . with investing , adversity can be a more important teacher than success . if you ' re having trouble this thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful about anything investment - related , try these on for size : * " asset allocation " is no longer just a quaint theory . the paramount investing rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk . but it took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home for many people who thought equities only rose in value . now , millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much they can lose in stocks - - and how bonds and short - term cash savings can offset market losses and preserve capital . it has been a hard lesson , to be sure . but investors who take asset allocation to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in the long run . and don ' t underestimate what that can mean for your peace of mind long term . * the wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned . in the late 1990 s , many economists lamented how the u . s . savings rate continued to shrink . some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be rising nonstop . in other words , many americans were letting the stock market do their saving for them when share prices were rising 20 % or more each year . now , with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns on stocks in this decade , it ' s clear that many people will have to find a way to save regularly if they ' re going to meet their long - term financial goals , especially retirement . this may not be a pleasant reality , but it ' s better for most people to have faced this fact sooner rather than later , while there may be time to make up lost ground . * a healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and those who tout them . the market ' s slide has discredited a legion of wall street analysts , money managers and others whose knowledge , understanding and judgment were clearly lacking , in retrospect . investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present themselves as " experts " is a highly dangerous strategy , if it can be called a strategy at all . sure , it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the moon and nobody had much use for reviewing a company ' s fundamentals . but that wasn ' t investing - - it was speculating , and on a massive , and ultimately ruinous , scale . people have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the market , and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their portfolios in the long run . just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401 ( k ) retirement savings sum into aggressive - growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000 - - right before the market peaked - - because of the bullish comments of some 25 - year - old tech stock analyst . those investors aren ' t likely to make a move like that again . * free - market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies . capitalism may be harsh , but it ' s efficient when the good times end and it ' s time to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power - - and deserve more capital . hundreds of dot - coms have failed , but who really misses them ? is it any harder to find what you want on the internet ? it probably would have been much worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors ' funds for another year instead of failing when they did . but the market isn ' t just eliminating small companies that never had much of a future . the financial near - collapse of energy giant enron corp . exposed a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit - - to the point that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to 1997 " should not be relied upon . " also to be weeded out , though over a longer time period , will be mutual fund managers whose performance running other peoples ' money has been a nightmare for those investors - - meaning , the returns produced have been far worse than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that particular sector . these managers know who they are - - and , hopefully , their shareholders know by now as well , and will vote with their feet . the free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control prices . once again , the organization of petroleum exporting countries has lost its ability to prop up crude oil prices , which have sunk to two - year lows amid the weak global economy . that ' s lousy for opec , but it ' s great for every energy consumer . * the market ' s woes have altered many investors ' priorities for the better . the wild bull market of the late 1990 s demanded peoples ' attention , and got it . for some , stocks became an obsession . their portfolios dominated their lives , especially if they were actively trading shares . they believed they were going to be rich , or richer , and that it was all because of how smart they were . now , most people have been humbled by the market . in the process , some have realized that they don ' t want their mood determined by their portfolio ' s day - to - date price changes . the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , of course , also changed many peoples ' view of what truly matters to them . money is important , but you aren ' t your stocks , and they aren ' t you . life is more than a daily stock quote . * tom petruno can be reached at tom . petruno @ latimes . com . for recent columns on the web , go to www . latimes . com / petruno . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial investing james k . glassman don ' t be a pudd ' n ' head , diversify james k . glassman 11 / 18 / 2001 the washington post final hol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved warren buffett , who was probably the greatest investor of the 20 th century , is fond of quoting the salacious actress mae west as saying , " too much of a good thing can be wonderful . " in the market , such a motto would lead you to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks you really , really like . peter lynch , who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20 th century , calls spreading yourself too thin " diworseification . " smart , witty and brilliant at picking stocks , buffett and lynch may not need diversification , but the rest of us do . when you own one stock , you ' re out on a limb . for example , very few analysts - - with or without a conflict of interest - - predicted that shares of enron , the energy and trading company , would tumble by 90 percent in a year . put all your eggs in a basket like that and you end up with a gooey mess . the more stocks you own - - as long as they are in different industries - - the more the overall riskiness of your portfolio is modulated . the reason you don ' t want a super - risky portfolio is simple : while warren buffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the value of his holdings , most investors are not . a portfolio that increases in price by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year , rises by three - quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third . but reasonable investors prefer the consistent ride . it prevents them from doing something stupid , such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money during that first disastrous year . consider the sad case of james d . mccall , who earlier this month resigned as manager of the merrill lynch focus twenty mutual fund . two years ago , merrill wanted mccall ' s services so desperately that the firm went to court to pry mccall away from his previous employer , pilgrim baxter , where he rang up impressive gains in the late 1990 s . ( his big success was called pbhg large cap 20 . ) and when they got mccall , merrill ' s brokers raised more than $ 1 . 5 billion from their clients for him to invest . while the average growth - stock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks , with the top 10 holdings representing about one - fourth of the portfolio ' s total value , mccall specialized in what are called " concentrated portfolios . " in the case of merrill lynch focus twenty , he owned , as the name implies , just 20 stocks . at last report , his top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two - thirds of the fund ' s assets . if mccall had spread his 20 stocks among , say , a dozen different industries , he might have smoothed his ride . instead , 69 percent of his assets went to technology firms . the focus fund and a smaller one that mccall ran called premier growth were launched in march 2000 . within just 17 months , all but $ 650 million of the clients ' original $ 1 . 5 billion had vanished . it is hard to imagine losing as much as focus twenty did even if you tried . as of nov . 9 , the week mccall resigned , the fund was down 72 percent for the year , compared with a loss of 14 percent for the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index , the benchmark for fund managers . according to the latest report from morningstar mutual funds , 19 of mccall ' s 20 stocks had declined during 2001 , the only exception being harley - davidson . more amazing , 16 of the 19 losers had fallen by at least half . ( by the way , enron was mccall ' s seventh - largest holding . ) " this fund has had a wretched existence , " wrote morningstar analyst kunal kapoor , who did admit a grudging admiration for mccall ' s perseverance . mccall ' s " faith may turn out to be well placed over time , " kapoor said . unfortunately , time ran out . my point here is not to pick on mccall but to reveal the perils of concentration . buying focus twenty as a technology fund , and consigning it to no more than one - fifth of your holdings ( with the rest of your assets in diversified , conventional stocks or funds ) might have made sense , but focus twenty was touted as a " long - term capital appreciation " fund , not a sector fund . here , it failed , but maybe it didn ' t have to . the manager who made the concentrated fund popular , tom marsico , who ran janus twenty , took care to spread his holdings around . his successor , scott schoelzel , has suffered losses lately ( he is down 28 percent year - to - date , but that ' s after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years ) , but they have not been nearly so catastrophic - - and for good reason . schoelzel ' s last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks , two financials , one drug company , one energy firm ( whoops , enron again ) , one industrial , one consumer - durables company and one services firm . for investors in individual stocks , the important question is this : how much diversification is enough ? some risk is inherent in even the broadest portfolio . this is called market , or " systematic , " risk . over the past 75 years , market risk , as measured in standard deviation , has been about 20 percent . in other words , in two - thirds of the years the annual return of the s that is , between a loss of 9 percent and a gain of 31 percent . that ' s still volatile , but if you invest in stocks you have to live with it . what you don ' t have to live with is anything more volatile . so your objective in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avoid what is called " idiosyncratic , " or extra , risk . a portfolio with just a few stocks , or one like mccall ' s , that is overloaded in a single sector , has lots of idiosyncratic risk . in 1977 , an influential study found that investors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a wide variety of sectors ; in fact , owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk sharply . recently , however , the market has appeared to be far more volatile , and a new study by a group of economists headed by john campbell of harvard found that many more stocks were needed - - around 50 - - to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market . what campbell ' s group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the 1990 s , but that stocks within those sectors had , so you need to own more of them . but owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck - - and it brings up the buffett - lynch admonitions about too much diversification . it is hard just to take the time to make the selections , but even buy - and - hold investors need to keep track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management , product failures or new competition ( not to mention enron - style accounting shenanigans ) - - signs that it ' s time to sell . one good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual funds and stocks . for example , you might want to put 50 percent of the money you have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the s & p itself , like vanguard index 500 , which charges rock - bottom expenses and guarantees that risk won ' t exceed systematic levels . you could also consider a broad fund that ' s managed by human beings , such as meridian value or baron growth , which are recommended by sheldon jacobs , editor of the no - load fund investor newsletter . then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector funds that specialize in technology , real estate , energy and small - caps , and the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks . ( i own 16 , at last count . ) there are many valid variations . just don ' t emulate mark twain . in a letter to clients recently , anthony m . maramarco of david l . babson & co . , the cambridge , mass . , investment firm , recalled the aphorism of twain ' s pudd ' n ' head wilson : " put all your eggs in the one basket - - and watch that basket ! " unfortunately , such a philosophy emphatically does not work in stock investing - - as twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fortune into the paige linotype , a machine that flopped . we all make mistakes . ( it was twain , after all , who pointed out that " human beings are the only animals that blush - - or need to .

2000 dow jones over many years they have pointed out that all the benefits of deals , and often more than all , accrue to the shareholders of the companies taken over , while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution . investors know this , and in normal market conditions news of a takeover will depress the bidder ' s share price . but in a bubble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria , as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equity . also , it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low . two years ago , companies such as marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices . now , when prices are much lower , hardly any acquisitions are being made ( and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees ) . an exception to the deal famine is gold mining , which just happens to have been one of the stock market ' s strongest sectors this year . another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks . over recent years their earnings - per - share forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average 8 per cent too high . this has not just been a mistake ; they have been paid to be over - optimistic . admittedly , attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here , as the embarrassed investment banks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market , but it remains to be seen whether much will really change . the mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts , and indeed many professional investors do not . that merrill survey , incidentally , shows that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings per share growth over the next year , while the stockbrokers ' analysts are still clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent . a final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their executives the wrong sort of incentives . the ruin of marconi may appear irrational , when multi - billion - pound acquisitions are being declared worthless after only two years . but executives with lucrative stock option plans , which pay off if their gambles go right , combined with golden goodbye and pension packages that are triggered if things go wrong , may well consider it perfectly rational , from their viewpoint , to take much bigger risks than other shareholders , or employees , would consider acceptable . moreover , sir christopher gent , shareholders of vodafone will remember , received a controversial # 10 m personal bonus last year for clinching the mannesmann takeover , a deal that requires # 10 bn of write - offs . in normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rational , but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window . many investors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly . that is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of winning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration . barry . riley @ ft . com .

up call by joe berardino 12 / 04 / 2001 the wall street journal al 8 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones in particular , our role as auditors of year - end financial statements presented by management . we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities , train our people and enhance quality . when a client fails , we study what happened , from top to bottom , to learn important lessons and do better . we are doing that with enron . we are cooperating fully with investigations into enron . if we have made mistakes , we will acknowledge them . if we need to make changes , we will . we are very clear about our responsibilities . what we do is important . so is getting it right . enron has admitted that it made some bad investments , was over - leveraged , and authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors , credit - rating agencies , and trading counter - parties . enron ' s trading business and its revenue streams collapsed , leading to bankruptcy . if lessons are to be learned from enron , a range of broader issues need to be addressed . among them : - - rethinking some of our accounting standards . like the tax code , our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science . in the process , we have fostered a technical , legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported . enron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what ' s going on in a business . like many companies today , enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities ( spes ) and other off - balance - sheet structures . such vehicles permit companies , like enron , to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet . wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings , which are well known to analysts and investors . as the rules stand today , sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements , even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards . basing the accounting rules on a risk / reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity ' s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet ; certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide . the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years . it ' s time to rethink the rules . - - modernizing our broken financial - reporting model . enron ' s collapse , like the dot - com meltdown , is a reminder that our financial - reporting model - - with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings - per - share number - - is out of date and unresponsive to today ' s new business models , complex financial structures , and associated business risks . enron disclosed reams of information , including an eight - page management ' s discussion & analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report . some analysts studied these , sold short and made profits . but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that , although they were confused , they bought and lost money . we need to fix this problem . we can ' t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial - reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past , but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what ' s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future . the current financial - reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age . that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few . there were no derivatives . no structured off - balance - sheet financings . no instant stock quotes or mutual funds . no first call estimates . and no lou dobbs or cnbc . we need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model . disclosurs needs to be continuous , not periodic , to reflect today ' s 24 / 7 capital markets . we need to provide several streams of relevant information . we need to expand the number of key performance indicators , beyond earnings per share , to present the information investors really need to understand a company ' s business model and its business risks , financial structure and operating performance . - - reforming our patchwork regulatory environment . an alphabet soup of institutions - - from the aicpa ( american institute of certified public accountants ) to the sec and the asb ( auditing standards board ) , eitf ( emerging issues task force ) and fasb ( financial accounting standards board ) to the pob ( public oversight board ) - - all have important roles in our profession ' s regulatory framework . they are all made up of smart , diligent , well - intentioned people . but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today ' s complex financial issues . standard - setting is too slow . responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession . all of us must focus on ways to improve the system . agencies need more resources and experts . processes need to be redesigned . the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review , and address them . some criticisms are off the mark , but some are well deserved . for our part , we intend to work constructively with the sec , congress , the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest . - - improving accountability across our capital system . unfortunately , we have witnessed much of this before . two years ago , scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects . the dot - com bubble cost investors trillions . it ' s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us . in particular , we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises . millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security . of course , investors look to management , directors and accountants . but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders . they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework - - and walk away from companies they don ' t understand . they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep . for our system to work in today ' s complex economy , these checks and balances must function properly . enron reminds us that the system can and must be improved . we are prepared to do our part . -

the - street rival breached its merger agreement by breaking off the deal this past week . the suits escalate a war of words between the two houston companies over who was responsible for the merger breakup that contributed to enron ' s tumble into bankruptcy - court proceedings and they threaten to be a serious distraction for dynegy , another energy - trading highflier . credit agencies continue to penalize dynegy for gambling on an effort to buy enron , and dynegy ' s stock is off more than those of other companies with significant energy - trading operations . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , dynegy shares fell $ 3 . 18 to $ 27 . 17 each , below their 52 - week low . " there is no question that something as high - profile as this will attract senior management ' s attention for some time , " said robert grossman , chief credit officer with debt - rating agency fitch inc . , which has had dynegy on its credit watch since dynegy agreed to the merger . " the very fact that the lawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors ' minds and it could limit the upper end of the stock for awhile , " says ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . still , dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy - trading business . dynegy ' s president and chief operating officer , steve bergstrom , who worked for enron in the early 1980 s , is considered one of the brightest lights in energy trading and dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipelines , production and power - plant capacity to complement its trading operations . as enron was cratering last week , dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron ' s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural - gas - supply deals . as enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgorge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers , " dynegy was a direct beneficiary , " an enron trader said yesterday . " when we couldn ' t do it , people just thought ` let ' s go across the street and talk to dynegy . ' " he said dynegy was offering the best deals late last week . since oct . 1 , the number of customers executing agreements on dynegydirect , dynegy ' s online trading platform , has increased 20 % and dynegy ' s physical trading business also has increased , mr . bergstrom told analysts yesterday . " we continue to experience a clear flight to quality by customers , " he said . " we will not be distracted by these events . " many enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion of the company . " these traders are going to be looking for jobs and maintaining their relationships will be very important , and they may even be interviewing at dynegy , " said jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons thomson financial / datastream copyright ? 2000 dow jones now , lifeline is sought for trading unit by wall street journal staff reporters mitchell pacelle , jathon sapsford and ann davis 12 / 04 / 2001 the wall street journal a 3 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) turning to some of its largest creditors as potential saviors , enron corp . secured as much as $ 1 . 5 billion in new financing from j . p . morgan chase the move comes after enron ' s $ 10 billion suit against dynegy filed sunday for breaching its merger agreement . - - enron lays off about 4 , 000 employees mostly among its 7 , 500 employees in its houston head office . the layoffs come in addition to 1 , 100 jobs in london cut friday . - - congress steps up up its probe of enron , with house commerce committee staff set to meet this week with the sec and in houston with enron executives . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . fall of a power giant : burst of chapter 11 filings marks big year for the bankruptcy bar by richard b . schmitt staff reporter of the wall street journal 12 / 04 / 2001 the wall street journal al 0 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) how many lawyers does it take to file a chapter 11 bankruptcy - law proceeding ? in the case of enron corp . , about 30 . that ' s the number of attorneys new york law firm weil , gotshal & manges , enron ' s bankruptcy counsel , says it had on the case before it was filed over the weekend in federal bankruptcy court in new york . enron ' s chapter 11 filing , one of the largest in corporate history , is also apt to be one of the most lucrative - - for lawyers representing the company and those counseling its creditors , as well as an expected army of financial advisers and turnaround pros . the slackening economy and the burst of large chapter 11 cases - - five of the 15 biggest chapter 11 s of all time have been filed this year - - have left the formerly insular bankruptcy bar busier than ever and with a new cachet . with demand growing , rates are rising , reaching $ 700 an hour for the top lawyers . that is starting to put bankruptcy lawyers in the same league with merger specialists and trial attorneys . the pending chapter 11 case of pg & e corp . ' s utility unit this spring , some experts predict , could generate legal and other fees topping $ 400 million . " the phone has been jumping off the hook , " said andrew rahl , a partner and bankruptcy specialist at anderson kill & olick in new york . mr . rahl says his firm already has been retained by one client in the enron case , who he declines to identify , and is actively negotiating with two others . besides weil , enron has retained new york firm skadden , arps , slate , meagher & flom as " special counsel " to represent its outside board members , among other tasks . heading the team : mergers specialist peter atkins , best known for representing a special committee of rjr nabisco inc . in the $ 25 billion takeover fight celebrated in the best - selling book , " barbarians at the gate .

' s general electric capital corp . litigation between enron and its erstwhile merger partner , dynegy inc . , is also expected to trigger many billable hours . dynegy , which sued enron yesterday , seeking the right to complete the acquisition of enron ' s crown jewel pipeline system , has retained houston firm baker botts , along with akin gump strauss hauer & feld , based in dallas and washington . enron , which launched its own pre - emptive lawsuit in bankruptcy court on sunday against dynegy , is represented by weil securities litigator greg danilow and corporate chief thomas roberts , who recently handled amr corp . ' s acquisition of trans world airlines in delaware bankruptcy court . martin bienenstock , weil gotshal ' s chief bankruptcy lawyer on the enron case , said rates of firm partners likely to be involved in the matter range from $ 450 to $ 700 an hour . mr . bienenstock , who charges a $ 675 hourly rate , has recently represented holders of millions in bonds issued by excite @ home corp . , as well as such bankruptcy - law debtors as ames department stores inc . and g - i holdings inc . , an asbestos concern . with 80 bankruptcy lawyers , one of the largest such law - firm practices in the country , he added , " you can do a lot more .

' s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marks the beginning of complicated jockeying as hundreds of creditors seek to get the most they can at the expense of other creditors . filings expected to be submitted to the court subsequent to enron ' s original petition sunday will at least partially lift the veil of secrecy that has long hovered over the company ' s dealings . but for now , few of enron ' s many unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover , thanks to enron ' s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked away in partnerships not consolidated onto the company ' s balance sheet . in its chapter 11 filing , enron corp . listed $ 13 . 15 billion in debt . when combined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedings , on - balance - sheet debt totals $ 31 . 24 billion . some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional $ 27 billion in off - balance - sheet and contingent liabilities . the combined list of creditors attached to enron ' s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long . precisely because there are so many claims , the contesting among enron ' s creditors is expected to be especially fierce . while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims - - with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid , the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom - - bankruptcy proceedings aren ' t always set in stone . " chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the rights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses , " said stephen case , a bankruptcy lawyer with davis polk wardell in new york . in coming weeks , enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors , who buy distressed debt , for information about the ultimate value of the company . until now , many distressed - debt players have been on the sidelines , citing the impossibility of understanding enron ' s business operations , the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron . " traditionally , immediately after a bankruptcy filing , a flurry of opportunistic investors will look at the company , " said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy lawyer with coudert brothers in new york . " it is easier to analyze after bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available . " " after a filing , the paper tends to get concentrated , " added mr . case of davis polk . " many institutional investors have to dump their securities because they don ' t want to be seen in [ or aren ' t allowed to hold ] defaulted paper . so they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands . " complicating the negotiations : claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests , reflecting enron ' s combination of physical and financial assets - - thousands and thousands of financial contracts , whose value is uncertain and likely to be highly contentious . usually , it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a share of the assets . in order to compete , the savviest creditors , such as the distressed - debt funds , which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices , engage in a variety of strategies . for instance , they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn - out legal battle unless concessions are made . or , because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement , one party may buy up others ' claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class - - enough to influence the entire outcome . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . auditor andersen is added to enron 401 ( k ) lawsuit 12 / 04 / 2001 the wall street journal al 0 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) houston - - a lawsuit on behalf of members of enron corp . ' s employee - retirement plan has been expanded to allege that the company ' s independent auditor , arthur andersen llp of chicago , " knowingly participated in enron ' s breaches of fiduciary duty " by actively helping enron conceal its true financial condition and the imprudence of investing in enron stock . the amended suit , filed yesterday in federal court in houston by the gottesdiener law firm in washington , seeks to recover $ 1 billion in plan losses as well as the return of fees paid to andersen , which totaled $ 52 million in 2000 , the law firm says . at least three other lawsuits have been filed on behalf of enron ' s 401 ( k ) retirement plan members . enron filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy - court protection from creditors on sunday . " as enron collapses , we are obviously going to have to look elsewhere to get some justice for enron employees , " said eli gottesdiener , lead counsel for the plaintiffs . spokesmen for arthur andersen and enron said the companies don ' t comment on pending litigation . copyright ? 2000 dow jones former trans world dome by scott thurm staff reporter of the wall street journal 12 / 04 / 2001 the wall street journal al ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) two years ago , standing outside a half - built baseball stadium , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay announced that the high - flying energy giant would pay roughly $ 100 million over 30 years to put its name on the new home of the houston astros . that was well before fatal questions arose about enron ' s questionable finances . but after that , enron never had a chance . it was destined to join fruit of the loom inc . , trans world airlines , psinet inc . and others that spiraled downward after emblazoning their brand names on sports stadiums . it ' s as if putting a corporate name on a stadium is an act of such hubris that the sports gods demand retribution . for fruit of the loom , that meant filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999 , three years after putting its pro player athletic - wear label on miami ' s football and baseball stadium . twa took down its shingle from the home of football ' s st . louis rams earlier this year , after being acquired out of bankruptcy by american airlines . and psinet , a new - economy telecom firm that agreed in 1999 to pay more than $ 100 million over 20 years for naming rights to the baltimore ravens ' new football stadium , filed for bankruptcy protection in june . call it the stadium - naming jinx . " as soon as you put your name on something , you might as well go to the lawyers and draw up the bankruptcy petition , " jokes paul swangard , managing director of the warsaw sports marketing center at the university of oregon . shares of 3 com corp . , the maker of computer - networking equipment , were trading at $ 39 . 50 on sept . 7 , 1995 , when it agreed to pay $ 1 million a year to put its name on san francisco ' s windswept candlestick park , generating howls of local protest . six years , several corporate reorganizations and one tech downturn later , 3 com last month said it had had enough and told football ' s san francisco 49 ers it didn ' t want to renew . 3 com shares closed at $ 4 . 66 in 4 p . m . nasdaq stock market trading yesterday . compaq computer corp . doubled down on stadiums , attaching its name to indoor arenas in houston , its hometown , and in san jose , calif . now , compaq is struggling to sell itself to hewlett - packard co . edison international , namer of the anaheim angels ' edison field , saw its southern california edison co . unit flirt with bankruptcy after california deregulated its electricity market . most recently , anc rental corp . , parent of national car rental , filed for bankruptcy protection on nov . 13 , raising questions about the home of hockey ' s florida panthers . the hex is fodder for sports fans from the boardroom to the bleachers . " will it create some kind of stigma , and will people ask about it ? yes , " says richard sherwood , president of front row marketing services , in newtown , pa . , which works on stadium - naming deals . in baltimore , many fans had never heard of psinet before its name was affixed , in big purple letters , to the ravens ' stadium . psinet ' s bankruptcy filing is " an embarrassment and predictable result of the shortsighted greed of ownership , " says attorney and football fan neil brafman . he suggests renaming the ballpark " creditors ' committee stadium . " in houston , longtime astro season - ticket holder steve cross proposes that enron field be renamed " enron folds . " " that way you ' d only have to change a couple of letters , " says the 58 - year - old financial adviser . on - the - field success is no antidote . the astros won their division this year . the ravens won the super bowl in january , as psinet was sliding toward bankruptcy . their predecessors as nfl champs were the rams , playing under twa ' s soon - to - be - gone logo . " maybe i should run a regression to see if i should bet the team and short the company , " says new york hedge - fund manager seth tobias . mr . tobias says he likes just two of the stadium - namers as stocks : qualcomm corp . and fedex corp . in august 2000 , once - high - flying internet incubator cmgi inc . agreed to pay football ' s new england patriots more than $ 114 million over 15 years to put its name on the patriots ' new stadium in foxboro , mass . watching the new stadium rise in the distance while attending a patriots game earlier this year , mr . tobias says he wondered to himself whether cmgi would still exist by the time the new stadium opens next august . cmgi had a net loss of $ 5 . 4 billion for the fiscal year ended july 31 . its shares , listed on the nasdaq stock market , have fallen from $ 150 in early 2000 to $ 1 . 90 yesterday . stadiums have carried corporate monikers ever since men such as william wrigley and august busch put their names on stadiums used by teams they owned . but the commercial name - game really started in 1973 , when rich foods paid $ 1 . 5 million to put its name on the home of football ' s buffalo bills for 25 years . it was another 15 years before atlantic richfield co . and great western financial corp . put their names on basketball arenas in sacramento , calif . , and los angeles in 1988 . now , there are 62 major - league stadiums sporting the names of companies , which have agreed to pay a collective $ 3 . 4 billion for the privilege , over as long as 30 years , according to dean bonham , a naming - rights consultant in denver . as the deals have multiplied , the jinx has spread . beyond bankruptcies and other brushes with death , corporate stadium - namers are frequent takeover targets . arco , for example , was acquired by bp plc last year . pacific telesis , parent of pacific bell , agreed to be acquired by sbc communications the day before it announced a $ 50 million naming - rights deal with the san francisco giants in 1996 . shawmut national corp . paid to put its name on a new indoor arena in boston in 1993 , but the company was acquired by fleetboston financial corp . before a single game was played . the philadelphia arena formerly known as the corestates center morphed into the first union center and will become the wachovia center as soon as next summer . the deteriorating financial health of airlines imperils naming deals at six indoor arenas . the former chief executive of ual corp . , whose united airlines unit named the arena in chicago , raised the prospect of filing for bankruptcy next year . some analysts believe the parent of america west airlines , namer of the arena in phoenix , may have to file sooner , if it doesn ' t get requested government aid . not every naming - rights deal leads inexorably to a company ' s demise . general motors corp . ( whose name graces the arena of hockey ' s vancouver canucks ) and pepsico inc . ( the denver nuggets and colorado avalanche ) are in no danger of disappearing . ( of course , the same would have been said about enron a few months ago . ) those who pay the big bucks believe they are getting their money ' s worth for stadium deals , through improved name recognition and an association with active lifestyles . " it provided a unique branding opportunity that only comes around every so often , " says robert waldrop , senior vice president of communications at reliant resources inc . , another houston energy firm . reliant last year agreed to pay roughly $ 300 million over 32 years to put its name on a football stadium for the houston texans , who will begin play next year , and adjacent livestock show and convention center . mr . waldrop says it would be " a real long stretch " to associate enron ' s woes with its stadium - naming deal . consultants say the deals are particularly useful for companies that are not household names , such as european electronics giants telefon ab l . m . ericsson and koninklijke philips electronics nv . philips uses part of the atlanta arena that it named as a showcase for its products . still , consultants say prices for stadium - naming deals are drifting lower , because of the weak economy and the disappearance of internet firms , many of which were active bidders . more than a dozen u . s . stadiums and arenas are seeking sponsors , including the superdome in new orleans , home to february ' s super bowl , comiskey park in chicago , and the former trans world dome in st . louis . wayne huizenga , who owns the dolphins and pro player stadium , has been seeking a replacement sponsor for more than a year . some companies say they ' ve learned to shy away . " it ' s very expensive , " says kristin schroer , a spokeswoman for southwest airlines , one of the few major airlines that doesn ' t have its name on an arena . " we would rather be able to charge our passengers lower fares so they can afford to fly to games and still have money in their pocket to buy a foam finger or eat out .

" do we find any value ? not in the equity , but as bondholders we ' re quite happy . " the first official indication of investor interest is expected early tomorrow , about 12 hours after the deadline passes for current shareholders to exercise their rights to acquire more shares . unlike a traditional european share rights offering , however , these rights can ' t be traded . that structure has helped keep hedge funds from selling shares in hopes of buying them at a lower price . the dutch government has already committed itself to buying 34 . 7 % of the new shares , and a syndicate of banks have promised to buy the remaining 65 . 3 % shares at 2 . 75 euros , about half the current share price . some professional money - managers are expected to seek shares this way . but others , including u . s . investors , who can ' t participate in the rights portion , are expected to wait until afterward . they have until thursday evening to order shares but , unlike with the rights issue , can specify at what price they ' re willing to buy . many aren ' t expected to place their orders before thursday . " if you ' re a recent investor , you may well want to take up your full rights , " said an asset manager at a major dutch pension fund . " but if you purchased shares in the last offering [ in november 2000 ] , at 17 euros , you ' re not going to be eager to buy more kpn shares . " the share offering nonetheless comes at a time when investors are turning more positive toward the telecom sector in general after shunning it for more than a year . finland ' s sonera corp . , another heavily indebted telecom group , raised one billion euros through a heavily discounted rights issue to existing shareholders last month . the mood has soured somewhat in recent days , hurt by signs that the u . s . economy won ' t recover as quickly as investors had been hoping . the collapse of enron corp . also has refocused investor attention on credit risk . investors note that it ' s particularly difficult to estimate kpn ' s fair value because its heavy debt load means a small change in financial assumptions about the company can create a big change in the valuation . " we like telecoms as a house , and we think they should be overweighted " in a portfolio , says alia baig , a london - based european portfolio manager at axa investment managers , which has gbp 160 billion in assets under management . " individually we ' re very particular about what stocks we do like , and we tend to prefer mobile [ operators ] over fixed - line [ operators ] . " kpn isn ' t a " must - own " stock , she said and she doesn ' t intend to exercise her rights . she predicts the final share price won ' t be above four euros and says the price would have to be between three euros and 3 . 50 euros to be interested . " that ' s just to reflect the risk in the turnaround and that there ' s new management . " but joost eijsink , an asset manager at dutch investment bank eureffect , predicted that while selling pressure will increase throughout the week , most of the fall in the share price has already occurred . " last week there was a lot of optimism over the issue price , with a lot of people seeing it somewhere between five euros and 5 . 50 euros , " he said . " people were maybe a little too positive . " mr . eijsink said funds the firm manages are likely to subscribe to the issue . but its advice to other clients will vary . - - - yesterday ' s market activity asian markets were mixed as taiwanese stocks soared after the weekend parliamentary elections and tokyo stocks fell sharply . european shares were generally lower , while brazilian and argentine shares jumped after buenos aires introduced a series of capital controls . overall , the dow jones world stock index fell 1 . 56 points , or 0 . 90 % , to 172 . 27 . excluding the u . s . , the index dropped 1 . 17 points , or 0 . 95 % , to 121 . 59 . in tokyo , the nikkei stock average dropped 3 . 1 % , or 326 . 82 points , to 10370 . 62 , its lowest close since nov . 14 . credit - risk concerns prompted by enron ' s collapse and a stronger yen unleashed selling in major banks and high - tech heavyweights . ufj holdings ended down 9 . 8 % at 367 , 000 yen , while sumitomo mitsui banking lost 4 . 9 % to 637 yen . baby clothes wholesaler kimuratan plunged 25 % to 89 yen , and baby - care - goods maker pigeon dropped 19 % to 1 , 270 yen . baby - related stocks had been soaring following news of the princess ' s pregnancy but investors have begun selling ahead of her delivery . in taipei , the weighted price index rose 4 . 6 % , or 205 . 49 points , to 4646 . 61 following stronger - than - expected gains in the legislature for the democratic progressive party of president chen shui - bia . stocks also got a boost from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co . , the world ' s biggest contract chip maker , which forecast a sharp jump in fourth - quarter net profit . its shares , which comprise a large part of the benchmark index , rose 6 . 2 % to 77 . 50 new taiwan dollars . in london , the ftse 100 index closed down 0 . 7 % , or 39 . 0 points , to 5164 . 6 . banking stocks suffered on concerns over loan defaults stemming from the enron situation . royal bank of scotland fell 34 pence , or 2 . 0 % , to gbp 13 . 91 following weekend news reports that it has a gbp 600 million exposure to enron . enron also said barclays was the largest unsecured creditor for one of its divisions , enron north america corp . , with a claim of $ 126 . 1 million . shares in barclays fell 62 pence , or 2 . 8 % , to gbp 20 . 88 . in buenos aires , the merval index closed 6 . 1 % , or 12 . 30 points , higher at 214 . 75 . over the weekend economy minister domingo cavallo announced a series of capital controls to stem a run on banking deposits . the measures are also aimed at increasing transparency and government tax collections and making it necessary for more argentines to hold checking or savings accounts . shares in galicia , the country ' s largest private bank , jumped around 19 % to 47 . 9 centavos . - - - msci indexes % from nov . 30 nov . 29 12 - 00 u . s . . . . . . . . . . . . 1079 . 0 1079 . 6 - 13 . 7 britain . . . . . . . . 1582 . 1 1579 . 5 - 14 . 1 canada . . . . . . . . . 937 . 6 933 . 8 - 18 . 9 japan . . . . . . . . . . 655 . 2 651 . 3 - 18 . 9 france . . . . . . . . . 1485 . 2 1471 . 6 - 21 . 9 germany . . . . . . . . 636 . 9 629 . 2 - 22 . 1 hong kong . . . . . . 5765 . 4 5676 . 6 - 25 . 0 switzerland . . . . 790 . 8 796 . 9 - 22 . 2 australia . . . . . . 672 . 5 668 . 0 + 5 . 1 world index . . . . 997 . 9 992 . 7 - 18 . 3 eafe msci - p . . . . 1148 . 4 1134 . 4 - 23 . 1 as calculated by morgan stanley capital international perspective , geneva . each index , calculated in local currencies , is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 . p - preliminary . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . small - stock focus : genesis energy , valentis plummet , as small - cap stocks fall slightly by larry bauman dow jones newswires 12 / 04 / 2001 the wall street journal c 6 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - - small - capitalization stocks fell moderately in unusually light trading , though the group managed to retrace about a quarter of its intraday losses . the overall nasdaq market ended in negative territory , although the nasdaq composite index of both small and large stocks did close above its session lows . the small - cap market was weighed down by the weakness of financial stocks , which fell on concerns about the extent to which banks and financial - services companies were exposed to the collapse of enron , which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . financial stocks make up the second - largest industry group in the russell 2000 small - stock index , following technology . the russell 2000 fell 3 . 75 , or 0 . 81 % , to 457 . 03 , after posting an intraday decline of 5 . 27 , and the nasdaq composite , at 1904 . 90 , fell 25 . 68 , or 1 . 33 % . investors " are concerned the economy will weaken , " said david wabnik , senior portfolio manager at brinson partners .

" whenever there ' s a considerable amount of discretion that companies have in reporting their earnings , one gets concerned that some companies may overstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make earnings goals , " says abn amro analyst paul patterson , who follows energy - trading firms . mark - to - market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding energy - related contracts on their balance sheets , either as assets or liabilities , at the end of a quarter . for example , these could be agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices . under the rules , companies estimate the fair values of the contracts . quarterly changes in value - - representing unrealized , noncash gains and losses - - then are run through the companies ' income statements . one way to gauge the size of some companies ' past unrealized gains is to dig through their cash - flow statements , which sometimes specify the noncash portion of trading gains . at enron , unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company ' s $ 1 . 41 billion of originally reported pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax profit of $ 1 . 13 billion in 1999 . at dynegy , unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its $ 762 million in 2000 pretax profit and about half its $ 227 million in 1999 pretax profit . dynegy executives say there isn ' t anything wrong with the quality of their company ' s earnings . and they point to financial reports for the first nine months of 2001 showing that none of the company ' s reported earnings for this year came from unrealized gains . other energy traders whose earnings have been boosted in recent years by mark - to - market gains include american electric power , duke energy , el paso , entergy , mirant , pinnacle west capital and williams cos . how much discretion do energy traders have in valuing their contracts ? the rule , pretty much , is that there aren ' t many rules . for instance , during a conference last week sponsored by the fasb and the american accounting association , attendees were shown a hypothetical example under which the fair value of a power contract could range from $ 40 million to $ 153 million , depending on which assumptions of future trends were used . and the mark - to - market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafted in large part on approaches that enron and other traders lobbied for . " we developed those rules , " enron ' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an august interview . over the past three years , members of the fasb ' s emerging issues task force have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy - related contracts . what they have decided is that companies should be left to their own discretion , though the task force recognizes that could create problems . in a june 2000 report , for instance , the group noted that two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy contracts , resulting in widely different valuations . " those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value , " the report said . the task force ' s chairman , tim lucas , says it simply is too difficult to draft a one - size - fits - all solution : " there ' s no one way to do it . there are various models , and we think it requires professional judgment to assess . " further , he says , requiring companies to disclose all the estimates underlying their earnings would produce disclosures so voluminous that they would be of little value . that is in line with the industry ' s longtime position . in a june 2000 letter to mr . lucas , for instance , mr . causey said " the valuation process should be determined by individual companies , " and the task force " should not address the valuation methodology for energy or energy related contracts . " in its financial filings , dynegy explains that when market - price quotes aren ' t available for certain long - term contracts , " the lack of long - term pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments . " as a result , actual cash returns may " vary , either positively or negatively , from the results estimated . " quoted market prices offering independent guidance on many short - term energy contracts have become more readily available in recent years . even then , there aren ' t rules specifying which market quotes companies must use . for instance , should companies mark their contracts based on the " bid " price , which is the price a market maker would offer to pay for a given contract ? or should they use the " ask " price , which is the price at which a trader is willing to sell ? or somewhere in between ? currently , individual companies decide for themselves . on most contracts for short - term deliveries of natural gas , bid - ask spreads are fairly small , about 1 % or so . but even for some short - term electricity contract prices quoted on enron ' s now - shuttered online trading portal , spreads of 20 % were common . on contracts for short - term delivery of telecommunications bandwidth , enron often posted " ask " prices that were as much as eight times the posted " bid " prices . for other long - term derivatives , such as electricity contracts stretching 20 years or longer , market quotes don ' t exist . in such cases , companies are allowed to base contract valuations on their own undisclosed estimates , covering everything from future commodity prices to credit risks and discount rates . " it would seem wise for energy companies in this highly skeptical environment to provide the disclosures necessary for financial statement readers to understand the quality of their earnings , and provide the disclosures voluntarily , " says tom linsmeier , an accounting professor at michigan state university . for now , however , energy traders aren ' t stepping up their disclosures . dynegy ' s senior vice president and controller , michael mott , for instance , says his company " is committed to full disclosure and to eliminate any cloudiness around these disclosures . " but he says dynegy won ' t disclose any information about the market assumptions or methodologies underlying the unrealized gains it has recorded over the years . he says that would place dynegy " at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace .

' ' it has it all , ' ' said robert j . rosenberg , a partner who heads the bankruptcy practice at the law firm of latham the firm confirmed last week that it had received s . e . c . subpoenas in the agency ' s enron investigation . judge gonzalez , a brooklyn native who has been a bankruptcy judge since 1995 , conducted yesterday ' s hearing in businesslike , no - frills style . among the law firms with major roles in the enron case are weil gotshal shearman and davis polk & wardwell , among those representing the other lead bank , j . p . morgan chase . lawyers for these and the other firms taking part in the case will quickly find that there is little straightforward about either enron ' s liabilities or its assets . many of the company ' s transactions , for example , involve forward contracts for the delivery of goods - - gas , electricity or other commodities , mr . rosenberg noted . companies on the other side of not - yet - completed transactions have different rights from other creditors . rather than having to file a claim in bankruptcy court , they can take whatever steps their contracts permit in the event that enron defaults . moreover , while enron ' s bankruptcy filings show assets significantly more valuable than the company ' s liabilities , the company also has extensive off - balance - sheet debts that were not listed . ' ' that ' s a good question , whether at the end of the day there ' s enough to reorganize around , ' ' mr . rosenberg said . another crucial question will be whether enron can convince judge gonzalez that the decision by its houston rival , dynegy , to back out of an agreement to purchase enron precipitated its bankruptcy filing . along with its chapter 11 filing , enron sued dynegy on sunday in the bankruptcy court , seeking $ 10 billion in damages for canceling the merger . lawyers expect enron to point to a delaware judge ' s decision earlier this year requiring tyson foods to complete its merger with the meat packer ibp after tyson , citing what it said were undisclosed problems at ibp , tried to walk away from the deal . but that decision was in delaware ' s chancery court , not bankruptcy court , and lawyers said it was hard to predict the success of any attempt to impose that logic on the specifics of enron ' s deal with dynegy .

' ' the durability of such views is a sign of how effective enron was during the last decade in keeping washington at bay as the company pushed to restructure the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy markets . enron and its employees were the largest contributors to president bush ' s campaigns over the years , and enron gave more money to politicians in the last election cycle than did any other energy company . since 1993 , its employees and its chairman , kenneth l . lay , have donated nearly $ 2 million to mr . bush . in the 2000 election cycle , more than $ 1 million was donated to federal political campaigns , most of it to republicans . mr . lay also had powerful friends . he recruited wendy l . gramm , the top commodities regulator in the administration of president bush ' s father and the wife of senator phil gramm , republican of texas , to serve on enron ' s board in 1993 . the appointment came just five weeks after ms . gramm helped push through a ruling at the commodity futures trading commission that exempted many energy contracts from regulation . last year , as congress and the clinton administration debated whether to exercise more oversight of the financial instruments used by enron and other companies to trade energy contracts , mr . lay courted linda robertson , a senior treasury official who was the department ' s liaison with congress . ms . robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives while she was still employed at the treasury , her financial disclosure shows . the measure that became law , the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 , specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applied to brokers of money , securities and commodities . ms . robertson , who became the head of enron ' s washington office , did not return a phone call seeking comment . last spring , when the bush administration drafted a new national energy policy , mr . lay had a 30 - minute meeting with vice president dick cheney to discuss the report . the policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control of electricity transmission networks , an enron goal that was spelled out in a memorandum mr . lay discussed during his meeting with mr . cheney . enron also had an unusual opportunity to influence mr . bush ' s choices for the federal energy regulatory commission , which oversees the markets in which enron operates . mr . lay met mr . bush ' s personnel adviser , clay johnson , to discuss nominees . when mr . bush picked people to fill two vacant republican slots on the five - member commission , both had the backing of enron as well as other companies . enron did not always get its way in washington . it failed to win regulatory exemptions for some futures products it wanted to trade , for example . and with enron now discredited , its longtime nemeses like the southern company hope to turn the regulatory agenda in a direction that favors their interests . the southern company has long been enron ' s main challenger for influence in washington . the company has nurtured a loose coalition of southeast lawmakers - - the senate minority leader , trent lott of mississippi , most prominent among them - - in support of its view that the states should retain leeway in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation . so far this year , its political action committees have outspent all other energy companies , including enron and big oil companies like exxon mobil , in supporting members of congress , according to the u . s . public interest research group . southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of local regulators to supervise electricity pricing , production and transmission . ' ' we have long felt that enron ' s vision of open markets does not work with electricity , ' ' said dwight evans , executive vice president of the southern company . ' ' i think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events . ' ' mr . evans said that the federal energy regulatory commission under mr . bush had tried to ' ' design systems that meet what enron needs . ' ' congress should slow the commission , mr . evans argued , or risk a fresh bout of instability and volatile prices . some states have halted the introduction of open markets for electricity . nevada , oklahoma and new mexico are among those that have put off deregulation , while california and a few other states that once promoted unfettered competition are debating ways to reimpose regulatory control . enron ' s assiduous efforts to keep its energy trading free of government interference could be another casualty of its collapse . as the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars - - at one point up to half all electricity and natural gas transactions passed through enron ' s trading operation , by some estimates - - enron scrambled to hold off congress and regulators . but some regulatory experts now say that enron ' s collapse is reminiscent of the failure of long - term capital management . long - term capital was the hedge fund based in greenwich , conn . , that operated without direct federal oversight and , by some accounts , threatened world markets when its elaborate portfolio of derivatives crumbled in late 1998 . with its exemption from scrutiny in hand , enron revealed relatively little about its trading portfolio , leaving analysts guessing how it had made its profits . enron ' s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to plummet in recent weeks , after the company revealed some unorthodox financial arrangements that benefited top executives . ' ' enron was getting very heavily into derivatives , and along with wall street banks , they went to bat to keep us away , ' ' said michael greenberger , who was director of trading and markets at the commodities futures trading commission until early this year . ' ' this should be as scary for regulators and congress as long - term capital was . ' ' representative markey agreed that congress should demand more oversight of energy trading . he said regulators should begin requiring transparency from companies like enron , while examining the adequacy of their capital and the stability of their trading portfolio , much as banking and securities regulators do for companies in their domain . ' ' we ' ll do it now , ' ' he said , ' ' or we ' ll do it when we get the next shock .

2000 dow jones section a a defining issue by paul krugman 12 / 04 / 2001 the new york times page 21 , column 6 c . 2001 new york times company when a seemingly profitable enterprise suddenly goes bankrupt , there are surely lessons to be learned . when that enterprise is the most admired company in america , lauded by business theorists as the quintessential 21 st - century corporation , one wonders if it is the tip of an iceberg . and how many of us have , without knowing it , booked passage on the titanic ? it will take time , and many legal proceedings , before the full story of enron ' s collapse becomes known . but one thing is already clear : the case shows how adept corporate executives have become at shifting risk away from themselves and onto others , in particular onto their employees . enron ' s leaders have walked away from the debacle chastened but very , very rich . many of enron ' s employees - - no doubt including the loyalists who sent irate letters every time i criticized the company - - have lost their life savings . behind this disaster for ordinary workers lies a little - remarked sea change in america ' s retirement system . twenty years ago most workers were in ' ' defined benefit ' ' plans - - that is , their employers promised them a fixed pension . today most workers have ' ' defined contribution ' ' plans : they invest money for their retirement , and accept the risk that those investments might go bad . retirement contributions are normally subsidized by the employer , and receive special tax treatment ; but all this is to no avail if , as happened at enron , the assets workers have bought lose most of their value . it ' s easy to make the theoretical case for defined - contribution plans . such plans expand an employee ' s choices ; he can choose how much to save , and how to invest his money . and more choice is ordinarily good . but the sad fate of enron ' s employees highlights the difference between theory and practice . as gretchen morgenson of the times pointed out on sunday , workers across the country have been cajoled or coerced into holding a high proportion of their retirement assets in their employers ' own stock . the exploitive nature of this financial incest was emphasized by enron ' s now - notorious ' ' lockdown , ' ' in which - - purely by coincidence , say executives - - new rules forced employees to remain invested in the company ' s stock just as the firm began its death spiral . so much for freedom of choice . and even when employees have real choices , one wonders whether they fully appreciate the risks . the shift away from old - fashioned pensions coincided with an enormous bull market ; surely many workers who have never seen stock prices fall since they became investors underestimate the risk of capital losses . one hopes that corporate collapses will not become commonplace . still , it ' s highly likely that millions of american workers will have near - enron experiences , learning to their dismay that big chunks of their retirement savings have evaporated . they will be left dependent on the one great defined - benefit program that remains : social security . that is , if it ' s still around . the bush administration ' s commission on social security reform issued its latest report last week , just as enron entered its death throes . most of the criticism of that commission ' s work , my own included , has focused on its , yes , enron - like accounting : items seem to migrate onto or off the balance sheet to suit the commission ' s convenience . thus when the social security system takes in more money than it pays out , as it does at present , this has no significance - - the federal budget is unified , you see , so it doesn ' t mean anything when one particular piece of it is in surplus . but in 2016 , when the social security system starts to pay out more than it takes in , there will be a crisis - - social security , you see , must stand on its own . but the commission resorts to bogus accounting only to make the case for its ultimate objective : to convert social security from a defined - benefit system , which guarantees retired americans a certain basic income , to a defined - contribution system , in which the unwise or unlucky can find themselves destitute in their old age . some analysts i know think social security will be converted to a defined - contribution system , not because it is a good idea but because the financial industry - - which has enormous clout in our money - driven political system - - has so much to gain from the conversion . i hope they ' re wrong . but if they are right , the fate of enron ' s poor employees , victimized by a management team they thought was on their side , may truly be the shape of things to come . copyright ?

- - the combination of big losses and white house ties would have long since produced cries for a special prosecutor to see what ( if anything ) enron ' s buddies have done on behalf of the company . the upcoming hearings in the republican - controlled house should be fascinating , and there will doubtless be more hearings in the democratic - controlled senate . " we ' ve had no contact with the white house " since enron ' s meltdown started , says company spokesman mark palmer . " i ' m not aware that there have been any requests [ from enron ] for anything , " a white house spokesman says . even though enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out , lay isn ' t going to the poorhouse . unlike enron employees whose retirement accounts have been vaporized because they consisted largely of enron stock the company wouldn ' t let them sell , lay has plenty of wealth left . last year alone , he made $ 123 million of profit on stock options , according to enron filings . this year he has made an additional $ 25 million or so . note : on friday , with its stock at around 30 cents , enron changed its policy and allowed employees to sell it . ironically , what brought down enron from its lofty perch on the fortune 500 list ( no . 7 ) is that the markets , whose virtue it preached , lost faith in it after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief financial officer . and now , let ' s proceed to the syllabus of enron 101 : 1 . bubbles didn ' t end when dot - coms bombed enron , a major trader of electricity and natural gas , grossed $ 200 billion a year and had $ 60 billion of assets , but it turned out to be a bubble . its business depended on borrowing lots of money . people lined up to lend as long as enron seemed healthy . when suspicions arose six weeks ago after the company revealed its partnership problems , money trickled away . then it started leaving in a flood . as enron tottered , it lost trading business . its remaining customers began to gouge it - - that ' s how trading works in the real world . don ' t blame the usual suspects : stock analysts . rather , blame arthur andersen , enron ' s outside auditor , which didn ' t blow the whistle until it was too late . ( andersen says it ' s far too early for me to be drawing conclusions . ) 2 . deregulation can be dangerous it ' s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up , given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems . besides , breakthroughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufacturing plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid . letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else . but dereg has caused lots of problems . in 1998 , the midwest had huge spikes in the price of electricity and rolling blackouts : some utilities had sold power outside their service areas , and the traders they were relying on to replace that power didn ' t deliver . upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in several states , sticking established players with big costs . and , of course , there ' s california , which got caught with too little energy in the spring ( helping enron and others make big profits ) and now is stuck with too much expensive energy . this has crippled the state ' s finances , driven its biggest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers . leaving vital necessities such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market is risky . especially when a big player such as enron can vanish overnight . 3 . beware your own hype enron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas , and it was the primo player in that field . but it came to believe that it was good at everything . it wasn ' t . some of the debacles : losses of $ 2 billion each in the water and telecommunications businesses , and another $ 2 billion lost in a brazilian utility investment . it blew an additional $ 1 billion on an electricity - generating plant in india . hence , i think , the need to obscure rising debt levels and less - than - stellar results by dealing with so - called off - balance - sheet partnerships with " star wars " names such as jedi ( for joint energy development investments ) and chewco ( as in chewbacca , the wookiee ) . the fact that enron executives were involved in these partnerships and made money while the company got clocked didn ' t help . the summary the enron affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are . to wit : when someone tells you he ' s changing the world for the better and getting rich at the same time , hold onto your wallet . and when something sounds too good to be true , it probably isn ' t true . michael isikoff contributed to this column . sloan is newsweek ' s wall street editor . his e - mail address is sloan @ panix . com . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones rival dynegy sues for pipeline network peter behr washington post staff writer 12 / 04 / 2001 the washington post final eol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved enron corp . ' s record bankruptcy action rattled its houston home base yesterday , as the energy trader prepared to lay off 4 , 000 headquarters employees and began a bitter legal struggle with dynegy inc . , its neighbor and would - be rescuer , over the causes of its monumental collapse . enron told most of its houston workers to go home and await word on whether their jobs were gone . meanwhile , dynegy filed a countersuit against enron demanding ownership of one of its major pipeline networks - - an asset dynegy was promised when it advanced $ 1 . 5 billion to enron as part of its aborted nov . 9 takeover agreement . the legal battle began sunday , when enron filed a $ 10 billion damage suit against dynegy , claiming it was forced into a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding when dynegy pulled back its purchase offer following intense negotiations the weekend after thanksgiving . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , chuck watson , said yesterday in a conference call that enron ' s lawsuit " is one more example of enron ' s failure to take responsibility for its own demise . " " enron ' s rapid disintegration , " he added , follows " a general loss of public confidence in its leadership and credibility . " dynegy ' s shares fell $ 3 . 18 , or 10 percent , to $ 27 . 17 yesterday because of investors ' fears that the bankruptcy process will tie up dynegy ' s claim to the omaha - based northern natural gas co . pipeline , forcing it to write down the $ 1 . 5 billion payment to enron . " dynegy is now entangled in this enron mess , " said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . " investors fear the $ 1 . 5 billion investment might not be easily converted into ownership of the pipeline , " said tom burnett , president of merger insight , an affiliate of wall street access , a new york - based brokerage and financial adviser . on the broader impact of enron ' s bankruptcy , donald e . powell , chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp . , said in an interview that regulators believe so far that losses on loans to the ailing energy company will be painful but not large enough to cause any bank to fail . however , he said that the ripple effect on other enron creditors , who in turn may find it harder to repay bank loans , is more difficult to gauge . " enron is a complex company , " said powell . " it will take some time to digest the consequences to the banking industry . " the fdic insures deposits at the nation ' s 9 , 747 banks and thrifts . shares of enron ' s major european bank lenders also fell yesterday on overseas markets . the stock price of j . p . morgan chase , one of enron ' s lead bankers , fell 3 percent , or $ 1 . 17 , to $ 36 . 55 . enron told a bankruptcy court judge in manhattan that it has arranged up to $ 1 . 5 billion in financing from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup to keep operating as it reorganizes under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , according to the associated press . the charges and countercharges between enron and dynegy are the opening rounds in a what legal experts predict will be a relentless battle between the two houston companies . hundreds of lawyers representing investors and employees are lining up to question enron executives and the former enron officials who quit or were fired in the past four months as the fortunes of the powerful energy trading company disintegrated . ahead of them are securities and exchange commission investigators probing whether enron concealed critical information about its problems from shareholders . investigators from the house energy and commerce committee are headed for houston this week to pursue a congressional inquiry into the largest bankruptcy action in u . s . history . and in the lead position is u . s . bankruptcy judge arthur j . gonzalez in new york , who has sweeping powers under federal law to oversee claims against enron , as the company tries to restore its trading business and settle creditors ' claims . dynegy ' s immediate goal is to have the ownership of the northern gas pipeline decided in state court in texas , where the companies are located , said dynegy attorney b . daryl bristow of baker botts .

2000 dow jones investors pay for this advice . but the biggest stockbroking outfits are owned by investment banks that also do other types of business : advising companies on mergers , helping them to issue shares or bonds . these advisory businesses create a conflict of interest : in order to cultivate corporations that may hire them , banks are reluctant to allow their stock analysts to issue sell recommendations on their stock . the " chinese walls " that are supposed to guarantee analysts ' objectivity by separating them from other parts of their banks are ineffective , and sometimes nonexistent . in some banks , stock analysts who are supposedly working in investors ' interests are also expected to work on corporate advisory projects . this kind of conflict may explain why many analysts continued to recommend enron ' s stock just a few days before the company ' s bankruptcy . in one unfortunate case , lehman brothers rated enron a " strong buy " as it headed toward disaster . it may or may not be coincidental that lehman was in line to earn a large fee for advising on the takeover of enron - - a takeover that fell through partly as a result of falls in enron ' s stock price . a similar conflict of interest plagues audit firms . auditors are supposed to serve investors by certifying the accuracy of companies ' financial statements . but auditors also earn consulting fees when they advise companies on information technology and other management issues . the desire to win consulting contracts may reduce auditors ' appetite for dust - ups with companies whose accounts seem suspicious . enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen , earned $ 27 million in consulting fees from the company last year - - slightly more than the $ 25 million it got paid to audit enron ' s books . at the same time it failed to challenge enron ' s habit of hiding some of its dicier business in partnerships that went unreported on the balance sheet . the conflicts of interest at stockbrokers and auditors , while similar , demand different remedies . investors themselves are in a position to correct some of the stockbroker problem : they can ignore advice from analysts at the integrated investment banks , and route their business through smaller independent stockbrokers . but the auditor conflicts need to be fixed by regulators at the securities and exchange commission . the commission ' s last chairman , arthur levitt , took a tough line with the auditors ; his successor , harvey pitt , has struck a softer tone . with luck , mr . pitt will now adopt more of his predecessor ' s outlook . without objective auditing , there will be more and more enrons - - and more and more investors , lenders and employees who get unfairly burned . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ?

2000 dow jones financial desk some power customers could see disruptions nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 12 / 04 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . warned electricity customers monday that it might be unable to serve them all because of the financial problems that led the houston energy giant to file for the largest bankruptcy in u . s . history . such a pullout could cause short - term disruptions in california if done with little notice , especially on a cold day with many power plant outages and extra demand from holiday light displays , energy officials warned . but the state ' s relatively new power - buying operation would be up to the task of lining up any extra electricity that might be needed for enron ' s customers , officials said . they just want as much notification as possible to avoid the frightening shortfalls of last winter and spring , when power buyers frantically scoured the west by phone to scare up any available megawatt to prevent rolling blackouts . " if the entire amount was dumped back on the grid without giving the grid time to absorb it , that would not be such a good thing , " said pete garris , acting deputy director in charge of the california department of water resources ' power - buying division . enron is believed to supply as much as 1 , 400 megawatts of electricity demand by institutional and industrial customers in california , including the university of california and california state university systems . that is equivalent to the usage of slightly more than 1 million average homes , or nearly 4 . 5 % of peak use on a typical winter ' s day . for nearly a year , dwr has been charged with buying about one - third of the power needed by the customers of southern california edison , pacific gas & electric and san diego gas & electric . a severe cash crunch and the collapse of the state ' s primary power market left those utilities without the means to buy electricity . enron is best known as an energy trader - - once the world ' s largest - - and pipeline owner , as well as a politically powerful proselytizer for the deregulation of electricity and other commodities . but the company also runs a fast - growing marketing business that delivers power to industrial customers as a kind of utility surrogate . enron continues to operate under protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code while it comes up with a plan to pay off its more than $ 31 billion in debts . " so far , the enron situation has not affected the reliability of the electrical system , " said stephanie mccorkle , spokeswoman for the california independent system operator , which runs the grid of long - distance transmission lines that serves about 70 % of the state . however , some customers have received unsettling " dear customer " letters from enron . " they assured us that things would continue as before , but they also said that they are reviewing the situation , " said chuck mcfadden , spokesman for the uc system , which uses enron power at seven of nine campuses . the cal state system , which relies on enron to light 19 of 23 campuses , has received no direct communication from enron , said spokeswoman clara potes - fellow . on its web site , enron sought to reassure electricity and natural gas customers that it would continue to provide service . but the company went on to say : " if . . . for some reason , enron does not provide gas or power , the utility will automatically serve these customers . " that could be a problem in california , where utilities no longer buy additional power for their customers and regulators have ended the program that allows new customers to pick an electricity provider other than the traditional utility . if enron were to drop customers , they would revert to their former utility , and any extra power would have to be supplied by the state , said terrie prosper , a spokeswoman for the california public utilities commission . " i don ' t think it would be a problem , " she said . " it ' s not like a whole city coming online all at once . " in a signal that enron is already pulling back , the company informed the department of water resources on monday that it would no longer fulfill a short - term contract with the agency to supply 800 megawatt - hours a day of electricity to state buyers . pg & e spokesman john nelson noted that the utility would deliver power to any customer that needs it , but regulators and power buyers would have to work out where that power would come from . gov . gray davis said he doubts enron ' s bankruptcy filing will have an immediate effect on california , although he predicted it could result in rising wholesale electricity prices in coming days . " it just shows you what a chancy business electricity deregulation is , " davis said in mexico city , where he was meeting with president vicente fox . * times staff writer dan morain in mexico city contributed to this report . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk markets enron , mideast weigh on stocks wall st . : dow declines 0 . 9 % , and nasdaq is down 1 . 3 % . oil prices rise ; bond yields fall . from times staff and wire reports 12 / 04 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 4 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company stocks closed broadly but modestly lower monday , pressured by concerns over enron ' s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the latest wave of violence in the mideast . crude oil prices rose above $ 20 a barrel for the first time since nov . 13 on fears the deepening conflict between israel and the palestinians could threaten oil supplies . on wall street , the dow jones industrial average fell 87 . 60 points , or 0 . 9 % , to 9 , 763 . 96 , while the nasdaq composite gave up 25 . 68 points , or 1 . 3 % , to 1 , 904 . 90 . the blue - chip standard & poor ' s 500 index fell 0 . 8 % to 1 , 129 . 90 , its fourth decline in five sessions . losers outnumbered winners 3 to 2 on the new york stock exchange and 23 to 13 on nasdaq , though in relatively slow trading . stocks fell in early trading , then pulled up from their lows in the afternoon . the latest u . s . economic data suggested the picture may be brightening somewhat , but that failed to stir much new buying interest in the stock market . still , " it ' s an amazing market that it has held up this well , given that it was thrown a lot of bad news with everything in the middle east and argentina , " tom schrader , head trader at legg mason wood walker in baltimore , told bloomberg news . in commodities trading , worries about a further escalation in the israeli - palestinian conflict helped push near - term crude oil futures up 65 cents to $ 20 . 09 a barrel in new york . analysts cited fears that terrorists might try to disrupt oil shipments from the middle east . concern about enron ' s bankruptcy helped send many bank and brokerage stocks lower , though analysts said major banks ' losses on enron debt are likely to be smaller than some investors fear . in the bond market , long - term treasury yields continued to ease . many economists say the federal reserve will cut its key short - term rate , now 2 % , to as low as 1 . 5 % when policymakers meet dec . 11 . on monday , fed chairman alan greenspan had lunch with president bush . the 10 - year t - note yield fell to 4 . 69 % from 4 . 75 % friday , and now is the lowest since nov . 14 . the five - year t - note yield eased to 4 % from 4 . 06 % . among monday ' s highlights : * enron ' s bankruptcy helped pull j . p . morgan chase down $ 1 . 17 to $ 36 . 55 and citigroup down 99 cents to $ 46 . 91 . among power companies , former enron suitor dynegy dived $ 3 . 18 to $ 27 . 17 , calpine slumped $ 3 . 06 to $ 18 . 50 , and reliant resources lost 47 cents to $ 15 . 80 . * oil and natural - gas stocks rallied as crude prices rose . chevrontexaco gained $ 1 . 44 to $ 86 . 45 , apache rose $ 1 . 07 to $ 47 . 06 , and unocal jumped $ 1 . 12 to $ 34 . 01 . * major technology stocks were mixed . chip maker micron technology rose $ 1 . 40 to $ 28 . 56 , and microsoft added 56 cents to $ 64 . 77 . but software giant oracle slipped 33 cents to $ 13 . 70 after merrill lynch lowered its earnings and revenue estimates for the company . the brokerage cited a challenging environment for software spending . * internet stocks pulled back . ebay fell $ 1 to $ 67 . 07 , amazon . com lost 83 cents to $ 10 . 49 , and aol time warner slid $ 1 . 32 to $ 33 . 58 . * airline stocks were mostly lower as oil prices rose . delta fell 91 cents to $ 28 . 07 , united parent ual lost 57 cents to $ 16 . 30 , and northwest gave up 56 cents to $ 17 . 36 . * retail shares struggled . may department stores lost $ 1 . 31 to $ 34 . 53 , kohl ' s slid $ 1 . 45 to $ 66 . 40 , and sears was off $ 1 . 16 to $ 44 . 35 . * household international fell $ 2 . 60 to $ 56 . 39 . the consumer - finance company may be using accounting practices to obscure loan losses , barron ' s magazine said , citing analysts . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk banks ' enron losses seen limited bankruptcy : the firm says it owes three major lenders $ 7 . 55 billion , but analysts say that total overstates the exposure . bloomberg news 12 / 04 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 6 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company new york - - enron corp . ' s bankruptcy filing says the firm owes citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and bank of new york co . a combined $ 7 . 55 billion . but analysts say the actual amount owed the big banks may be less than half that , because the loans have been syndicated among other lenders . banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk . the big banks also are listed as holders of enron bonds and other securities , but analysts say many of those securities are owned by investor clients of the banks . " it ' s very difficult to piece together the reality " of lenders ' exposure to enron , said robert napoli , an analyst at brokerage abn amro inc . who owns citigroup shares . worries about financial companies with credit extended to enron pushed many of those stocks lower on monday . citigroup fell 99 cents to $ 46 . 91 , j . p . morgan chase lost $ 1 . 17 to $ 36 . 55 and bank of new york lost $ 1 . 04 to $ 38 . 20 , all on the new york stock exchange . among brokerages , goldman sachs fell $ 2 . 99 to $ 86 . 01 and morgan stanley slid $ 3 . 17 to $ 52 . 33 , also on the nyse . citigroup , the largest u . s . financial services company , is listed as having $ 3 billion in unsecured claims against enron . but the bank itself probably is owed $ 1 billion at most by enron , analysts say , and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines , on which citigroup should be able to collect . citigroup ' s earnings may be lowered by between $ 250 million and $ 500 million before taxes , or a relatively small 3 cents to 5 cents a share after taxes , as a result of its involvement with enron , napoli estimated . j . p . morgan chase - - which enron says is owed $ 2 . 1 billion - - says its true exposure totals about $ 900 million . of that sum , $ 500 million is unsecured and $ 400 million is backed by collateral . that exposure could result in a 15 - cent drop in earnings per share for j . p . morgan chase , said goldman sachs analyst richard strauss . the company had been expected to earn $ 2 . 02 a share this year and $ 3 . 16 a share next year . j . p . morgan chase also acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds , so although the company is listed by enron as a creditor on $ 1 . 9 billion of bonds , it may not be on the hook for a cent of that debt . citigroup and j . p . morgan chase on monday helped provide $ 1 . 5 billion in debtor - in - possession financing for enron . such new financing is considered low risk once a company is in bankruptcy , because it moves ahead of debts on the books before the bankruptcy filing . copyright ?

" the ones who seemed the most depressed , " she said , " were the ones who were left behind . they ' re going back to their jobs tomorrow , and it ' s really going to be empty . " only months ago , enron had the reputation for being a pot of gold , a place where a secretary could become a millionaire . the high - flying energy trading company seemed to be soaring , and employees were enjoying the ride with hefty salaries , lucrative stock options and pension plans . but their company ' s stock dropped from a high of $ 84 to less than the price of a soda at enron field in a year ' s time . for many of the employees , the spectacular collapse of their company is a financial and personal tragedy . many feel betrayed and angry . " these people who made $ 50 million a year , they destroyed the company because of their greed , " said charles weiss , former director of capacity managment in the broadband services department . " they ' re putting families at risk , they ' ve destroyed people ' s retirements . " one singled out one of their villains . " somebody said there was a picture of jeff skilling being used as a dart board . that pretty much sums it up , " said bob jones , a contract worker who had been employed in the creative services division . " i feel lucky i ' m so young , " said leigh estes , 26 , a software engineer . " people in their 60 s with many thousands of dollars in retirement , and now it ' s gone . it ' s tragic . " estes knows that finding a job will not be easy . the information technology market in houston isn ' t that good , she said , nor is the economy in general . and so many former it professionals from enron will be flooding the local market . some said they plan to move . division heads broke the news to their former staffers , giving them about 30 minutes to pack their bags and leave . they were given handouts with " frequently asked questions " about benefits , stock options and health insurance , but many said that much was still up in the air . " they wanted everybody to go home , " weiss said . " basically it was just crowd control to get everybody out of the building without a riot . " later in the day , new york bankruptcy judge arthur gonzalez accepted enron ' s request for $ 4 , 500 in severance pay for each terminated employee . " we anticipate that we will make additional requests in subsequent weeks for additional severence , " said karen denne , a spokeswoman for enron . but there is no guarantee the court will give more severence pay for employees , said robert rice , an employment lawyer with rice & associates . " it will depend largely on enron ' s overall financial picture , " he said . cobra , the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act , entitles enron employees to group rates for health coverage for 18 months . employees do have the right to apply for unemployment benefits . they will be paid through friday . medical insurance will be provided through the end of december . former enron employees are networking . they ' ve created their own web site to help the job search process and stay in touch . about 4 , 000 have already listed their names on the site . many at enron know of colleagues who worked there 30 years and lost $ 1 million or more . that ' s because many employees grew accustomed to a steady diet of lucrative stock options that tied them to the company with velvet handcuffs . they built homes , second homes and bought luxury cars . but now , with their options worthless , many are worried how they ' ll keep up those payments . for one employee in the financial mangement area of enron , losing $ 100 , 000 on his 401 ( k ) was bad enough . it paled in comparison to the $ 400 , 000 he lost with his employee stock ownership plan . many of his shares , which were given to him january 1994 , had a strike price of $ 15 a share . it was a sweet deal when he could resell at $ 84 a share . but he didn ' t need the money and opted to hold it for retirement when the tax hit wouldn ' t be as big . some employees blame enron for a good share of their losses in their retirement plans . the company was changing benefit administrators and froze assets in the plan on oct . 17 , the day after enron officials shocked the market by announcing it was taking a $ 1 . 01 billion third - quarter charge to its earnings to unwind unprofitable investments . steve lacey , an emergency repair dispatcher for enron - owned portland general electric , said he watched helplessly as his enron stock plummeted in value . he had invested all of his 401 ( k ) funds into enron stock . one 68 - year - old had been looking forward to a quiet retirement , buying a few acres , planting some crops and spending time with his granddaughter . but his wife , who had worked at enron for more than 20 years , lost nearly everything . now they ' re looking for new jobs . they never imagined that the big , aggressive company would ever come crashing down on them . they weren ' t sophisticated investors and put almost everthing they had into enron stock . " we don ' t know a bond from a stock , " he said . " we ' re just working people .

" this is collateral damage , " said analyst john olson of sanders morris harris of the stock price , although in his view the company itself is not damaged . the pain level is high for dynegy officials , he said , but " i think they have the facts and law on their side . " " stocks don ' t tend to perform well when you ' ve got a $ 10 billion lawsuit hanging over your head , " said carol coale of prudential securities research . in prudential ' s view , dynegy ' s stock would have been better off if it had never approached enron . in addition to the lawsuits , the widely publicized deal led to increased scrutiny by financial markets . ken randolph , executive vice president and general counsel , considers the stock price slump temporary , " due to the noise and overhang of the lawsuit . " he was unable to unable to tell the analysts how long it would take for the situation to be resolved , although they did say the houston suit over the pipeline was expedited for relatively quick resolution . " i ' m terribly disappointed it has culminated into these lawsuits , " said dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson in a conference call with analysts . the ongoing debate isn ' t good for the city or the industry , he said . likewise analyst curt launer of credit suisse first boston said it was impossible to predict how long the dueling lawsuits would continue . but he noted that the bankruptcy of columbia gas in 1991 took nearly five years to resolve . dynegy ' s second lawsuit claim for damages can ' t be filed anytime soon , according to randolph , because enron ' s bankruptcy filing resulted in an automatic stay . there will be a period of time for companies to submit their claims , he said , which means it will be filed sometime in the next few months . they are not estimating the size of their claim for damages , such as costs and expenses , plus the stock price drop . meanwhile , dynegy is attempting to limit the damage and rebuild confidence among investors . the industry is sound , and the fundamentals of dynegy ' s business remain strong , said dynegy president steve bergstrom . the company is finishing a good year and expects an earnings growth rate of 20 to 25 percent for 2002 . since oct . 1 , the number of customers using its dynegydirect web site doubled , and the number of transactions grew by 20 percent . the company said it will begin marketing chevron / texaco ' s natural gas starting jan . 1 , but didn ' t have details . olson considers it " a nice piece of business . " dynegy officials late sunday talked to all three credit rating agencies to provide the latest information and try to convince them not to lower the company ' s ratings . nonetheless , watson said the negative credit watch by the agencies - - which means they are reviewing the company with the possibility of a downgrade - - is expected to continue . the credit rating firms had anticipated a lawsuit by enron and were not surprised by it , he said . dynegy has been on a negative ratings watch since nov . 9 when the merger was first announced , without much impact on trading , officials said . dec . 4 , 2001 , 12 : 00 am houston chronicle pain of bankruptcy to hurt many others ` we ' re just all shocked ' by ralph bivins copyright 2001 houston chronicle the bankruptcy reorganization of enron corp . , the largest chapter 11 ever , will spread financial pain from the big banks in new york all the way to the local locksmith fixing the doorknobs in enron ' s headquarters . enron ' s huge debts , such as the $ 3 billion owed to citibank , the $ 2 . 4 billion owed to bank of new york and $ 1 . 9 billion owed to chase manhattan bank , flash large numbers that demand attention . but plenty of small houston companies - - firms that can ' t absorb major write - downs without really feeling it - - are getting pinched by enron ' s bankruptcy also . berger iron works is owed $ 675 , 000 by enron - - a huge sum for the 108 - year - old houston company . but berger , which created stainless steel stair railings and other items for enron ' s new 40 - story office tower in downtown , will be able to absorb the financial blow somehow , said bill carbery , chief financial officer of berger . berger , which has 45 employees , will not lay off personnel or cut back operations . " it ' s not going to bankrupt our company , " carbery said . " it ' s going to hurt , you bet . when somebody owes you that kind of money , it hurts .

" it has a serious impact on us . there ' s no question about that , " said william kendall , a partner in the architecture firm . " we ' re just all shocked because they have been such a good client . " kendall , which has 58 employees , said he is hoping to avoid slashing payroll because of the enron debt , but layoffs are a possibility . baker ' s safe and lock co . , which has one full - time employee on - site at enron ' s headquarters , hopes to keep its locksmith shop open at enron ' s buildings , said randy simpson , the company ' s president . baker ' s , with 22 employees overall , has twice been named " vendor of the year " by enron , simpson said . he said baker ' s has other significant clients and there are no plans for layoffs , but the bankruptcy could create ripple effects that hurt other enron vendors . " there ' s no doubt there will be a huge effect on companies that have done business with them , " simpson said . clark condon associates , a houston landscape architecture firm with 22 employees , is owed $ 8 , 000 by enron . clark condon had a $ 40 , 000 contract to work on the new enron building , which will be complete next year , said sheila condon , the firm ' s president . but the company had already collected most of the payment . " i was so thankful that we were at the end of work for that building . we would have been soaked for a lot more , " condon said . losing $ 8 , 000 is not desirable but would not be a tremendous blow to the company , condon said . graphtec , a houston sign firm with 40 employees , has created scores of new signs for the enron building , but not all of them have been installed , said gus brown , vice president of the firm . brown declined to discuss the details of graphtec ' s financial entanglement with enron , which listed graphtec as a creditor . but brown said it is not a crisis for the firm , which has a lot of other work lined up , including the sign work at the new reliant stadium . the enron fallout could even include the annihilation of some small companies , said bill gilmer , an economist for the federal reserve bank in houston . " i am sure there are some small companies that are highly dependent on enron , " said bill gilmer , an economist with the federal reserve bank in houston . " i am sure there will be all kind of vendors . . . that are going to get hurt . " most small businesses do not depend on a single client for a majority of revenue . but there will be many companies that will see thinner earnings as enron operates at a leaner level in the future , said economics professor steven craig of the university of houston . companies that handled advertising , accounting services or ink for the copying machines could be weaker without sales from enron , craig said . aztec facility services , a houston - based firm that provides custodial service to enron ' s downtown buildings , is expected to lay off some personnel as enron occupies less office space after the layoff of 4 , 000 employees , said bill widman , chief financial officer of aztec . " certainly we ' ll be cleaning less because there will be less to clean , " widman said . aztec has about 100 hourly workers cleaning the enron buildings . but enron is current with its payments to aztec and company officials hope to continue working with enron , widman said . " they have been very fair with us during this time of crisis , " widman said . " we expect to continue with their cleaning during this chapter 11 proceeding . " the hines real estate development firm is continuing with work on the construction of the enron center south building in downtown and should be completed next year , a spokeswoman for the houston developer said . hines is owed $ 385 , 000 by enron for its work on the tower , according to bankruptcy documents . dec . 4 , 2001 , 1 : 07 am houston chronicle woes leave enron field ' s name in question astros could do without naming rights distraction by greg hassell copyright 2001 houston chronicle as recently as two months ago , enron executives were toasting their decision back in 1999 to plunk down $ 100 million for the naming rights for houston ' s gleaming baseball park . buying the name enron field had done wonders for the ambitious company ' s quest of making a name for itself across the nation and around the world . without a doubt , they said , it was worth every penny of the $ 3 . 3 million they agreed to pay the houston astros every season for 30 years . but the past 60 days have been a nightmare for the high - tech energy company . with alarming speed , enron has collapsed and is fighting for its survival . with its future in peril , one of the many uncertainties surrounding enron is the identity of its glitzy namesake perched on the eastern edge of downtown . when baseball fans file into the stadium for the astros ' season opener april 2 , will the enormous blue letters spelling enron field still loom large over the centerfield scoreboard ? " if you were to ask me the question today , it will be called enron field on april 2 , " said pam gardner , the astros ' president of business operations . " but there is so much that could happen . every day could bring a new twist to this deal . . . . we are waiting to see how this plays out . " for now , enron is paid up on its financial obligations to the astros . the baseball club declined to say when the next payment is due , or how large . the team also declined to say what action it might take if enron fails to deliver the cash on time . for its part , enron officials are saying little about the stadium deal , which is relatively small fry when you consider that the company is embroiled in the largest chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in history . " it ' s like every other pre - petition claim , " enron spokesman mark palmer said . " it will become a matter for the bankruptcy judge . " enron field is but one of the many new stadiums experiencing an identity crisis . in baltimore , the super bowl champion ravens play football in a stadium named after a bankrupt internet service provider . but as beleagured as the company is , it has not yet missed a payment , and the place is still called psinet stadium . in st . louis , the rams play football in a dome that had been named after twa . but american airlines bought out the carrier , and the twa name has been removed from the stadium . the rams haven ' t found another company willing to pony up millions , so the stadium bears the temporary monicker of dome at america ' s center . as dull as that name is , it ' s probably better than what you ' ll find in miami , where the dolphins and marlins play in something called pro player stadium . the biggest problem with that is there ' s no sportswear company called pro player anymore . it has vanished , although the stadium name remains the same . in past naming - rights deals , the heaviest buyers have been high - tech outfits and airlines . both of those industries are in the tank , and it seems unlikely we ' ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon . " it is a period of uncertainty , " said todd gruen , managing editor of a publication called naming rights deals . " once we get a handle on where the economy is going , the naming rights industry can find its place as well . " just how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is underscored by the experience of the texas rangers . the team ' s multimillionaire owner , tom hicks , is hunting for a sponsor to buy the naming rights to what is now called the ballpark at arlington . so far , hicks and the rangers have struck out looking . " in our weakened economy , everything is kind of on hold , " rangers president jim lites told the fort worth star - telegram recently . so if enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the next 28 years , the astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corporate partner to fill the void . " i am guessing it will stay enron field for a while , " gruen said . in addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep - pocketed sponsors , the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition for companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill . with no labor contract in place between the owners and the players , the specter of another work stoppage looms over the game . if that weren ' t bad enough , baseball ' s own commissioner says the game is bleeding $ 500 million a year , and he is seeking to shut down two franchises before the season starts this spring . " this uncertainty doesn ' t come at a good time for the astros , " said dean bonham , chairman of the sports marketing concern called the bonham group . " major league baseball is on the precipice of a disaster . it is almost assured there will be a work stoppage in the next two seasons . i would categorize the impact of a work stoppage as catastrophic . . . . baseball is in serious turmoil . " gruen takes a less alarmist view of baseball ' s future but agrees that prospective sponsors " will probably want to wait until this labor situation is resolved . " which is not all bad . gruen thinks the very worst thing the astros could do is jump into a deal with another company that faces an uncertain future . " enron field is relatively new . it has only had one name , and that will keep the value higher , " he said . " the last thing they want to do is get involved with an unstable partner and go through this again in three or four years . that would really damage the stadium rights .

" if we don ' t get this credit , we may need it tomorrow , " bienenstock told the court monday . " if we do get it , we may never need it . " lenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get high priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and high underwriting fees . enron chief executive officer ken lay , who didn ' t attend monday ' s hearing , said in a statement the $ 250 million will be used to help enron fulfill obligations needed to run its business , such as employee payroll and vendor payments for goods and services provided on or after sunday ' s bankruptcy filing . enron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structure . bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks . gonzalez also signed off on a provision to let enron pay up to $ 4 , 500 in severance pay to workers being laid off . workers could get additional severance payments later as the bankruptcy progresses . a small number of employees may be eligible for up to $ 15 , 000 to cover travel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before enron sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . enron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its $ 219 million office tower that ' s still under construction in downtown houston . enron has already paid $ 180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the property would need to complete the work to realize any value from the project . jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , was the company ' s top executive at the hearing . " i ' m extremely disappointed to have to be here at all , " he said during a break in the session . as the bankruptcy progresses , enron and its creditors will examine the various parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable being sold off or kept as ongoing operations . enron ' s major creditors will meet on dec . 12 to form a creditors committee , which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money . enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on dec . 14 . enron ' s chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in u . s . corporate history . not surprisingly , gonzalez ' s courtroom was packed monday with more than 125 attorneys and reporters . enron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors after a planned merger with dynegy fell apart and cuts in enron ' s credit rating triggered serious problems for the company . enron listed assets of $ 49 . 8 billion and liabilities of $ 31 . 2 billion , though it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings . as enron decided where to file , it probably considered that houston and new york have among the nation ' s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the country , said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy specialist . choosing new york , she said , let enron avoid local issues hovering around the courthouse . and that includes current or laid - off enron workers . monday ' s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a year or more . despite enron ' s statements that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a rebuilt business of some type , the odds do not favor it . " it ' s challenging , but not impossible , " said rapoport . " a lot has to go right . " eighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their chapter 11 efforts , said jack williams , a law professor at the georgia state university college of law and scholar - in - residence at the american bankruptcy institute , a nonprofit think tank . those that fail - - even those that go in intending to reorganize - - typically end up liquidating all their assets either in the chapter 11 proceeding or converting to a chapter 7 liquidation case , he said . the biggest potential obstacles to success : a too - small asset base , not enough cash and a poor business plan , he said . as a case unfolds , it ' s not uncommon for the true value of a company ' s assets to turn out below the company ' s numbers , williams said . some companies actually file for chapter 11 , even though they intend to liquidate assets , experts said , as doing so gives them more control over a selloff . under a chapter 7 filing , a court - appointed trustee handles the liquidation . before it filed , enron had put much of its portfolio of international assets up for sale . any deals now need approval from the court , with proceeds going to creditors . the creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is considered by the judge , said joel kay , an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at hughes , watters & askanase l . l . p . in houston . that includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan enron files with the court . once a bankruptcy petition is made , the company cannot pay any debts incurred before the filing without permission from the judge , kay said . enron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contracts , deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed . for those the judge agrees to let enron keep , it will be allowed to make payments for future goods and services . companies with contracts enron is allowed to reject will be considered creditors . enron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the normal course of business . but if it wants to sell assets , borrow money or do something out of the ordinary , it must ask . for example , if enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation , the court will need to approve . several stock analysts expressed doubt that enron will come out of chapter 11 or be able to make its trading operation work again , even if a new trading joint venture is created . andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york said buyers and sellers of energy " are not going to come back to this new entity in droves . " " i ' m having a hard time thinking of a scenario where you can actually get a workable entity out of this chapter 11 , " he said . " it ' s going to be hard for them to reorganize around anything . they may not emerge from chapter 11 . " he expects shareholders - - generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in a bankruptcy filing - - will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy filing . the efforts of shareholders and employees who sued enron will be delayed or halted . such lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the bankruptcy court to move ahead . dec . 4 , 2001 houston chronicle q & a on the enron bankruptcy why did enron file for bankruptcy ? enron ' s increasing problems - - particularly the reduction in its bond rating to junk bond status - - triggered billions in claims that it could not afford to pay . filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying creditors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company . how will the company fund its day - to - day business going forward ? the two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day - to - day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay essential expenses - - such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like health insurance . at this point why would anyone lend them another penny ? after filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor - in - possession financing . lenders that provide such financing go to the front of the line when it comes time to get paid back . this agreement , which normally pays a top interest rate , has to be approved by other creditors . the creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigger payout than a complete liquidation . who will get paid back ? bankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy . first in line are those with debts secured by the company ' s property . at the bottom are common shareholders . in the middle are unsecured creditors . however , this is all subject to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit . if common shareholders are the last to get paid , why did the stock rise ? there ' s no good explanation . sometimes at the start of a big case , certain parties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareholders . other buyers are traders who see a short - term profit to be made in the price movement of the stock , which trades in pennies . will enron be able to come back ? that depends on whether management can pare this once huge company down to a profitable core . officials within enron have warned the surviving company may be far different than what you see today . often many operations are sold to raise cash to preserve a few key parts . dec . 4 , 2001 , 11 : 23 pm houston chronicle enron ' s recent troubles aug . 14 jeff skilling , who served as ceo for six months , steps down for personal reasons . ken lay assumes the role of ceo . enron ' s stock closes at $ 42 . 93 , off from a 52 - week high of around $ 85 . oct . 16 enron reports a $ 638 million third - quarter loss and discloses a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , partly related to losses by partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow . oct . 22 enron acknowledges securities and exchange commission inquiry into a possible conflict of interest related to the company ' s dealings with those partnerships . oct . 24 andrew fastow is replaced as chief financial officer by jeff mcmahon . oct . 25 enron draws on $ 1 billion credit line , hoping to provide liquidity and restore investor confidence . oct . 31 ?

sum ? s , and even enron officials conceded monday it will be a struggle to bring back its business . the trading floor was open mostly to enable traders to close out any positions , enron spokesman mark palmer said . traders at other companies contacted monday said they were keeping their distance . " none of our clients is doing business with enron , " said charlie sanchez , director of energy markets for gelber & associates in houston , which specializes in advising energy clients on risk management , including trading tactics . the company ' s widely anticipated bankruptcy filing was made sunday . the trading operation is not included in those filings because the company hopes to revive it by moving into an independent new company . enron has posted a message on its internet site to its trading customers , saying it was in discussions to bring in investors to recapitalize its trading business . the scale of such an operation is limited by the capital the company needs to keep on hand to cover possible losses in this volatile business . the new trading business would be staffed by enron ' s current trading team . chief executive officer ken lay , in a recent memo to employees , said : " we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy business . " companies that once depended on enron traders say it has already lost a key asset . " the commodity i would be most concerned with now is credibility , " said martin rosenberg , editor of utility business magazine . " will they have credibility going forward with people knowing they have cooked the books ? there are severe doubts about the viability of their trading operations . " the challenge enron faces is winning back customers that have gone elsewhere . companies that said they are no longer doing business with enron and have no plans to do so anytime soon include conoco , duke energy and txu . most companies shifted to cash - only trading with enron last week before halting business with enron altogether . enron was once the biggest energy trader in the world . on sunday , it filed the largest bankruptcy case in u . s . history . it also sued dynegy for $ 10 billion , accusing its rival of withdrawing a takeover bid to remove a competitor . but even if the company is able to salvage its trading operations , the clients it once had may be long gone by the time things are back to normal .

' s bankruptcy and the firing of 4 , 000 local employees , more than half its workforce in houston , evoked words of sympathy from city officials , although the newly re - elected mayor said there are no specific plans for assistance . the impact to houston should be minimal , mayor lee brown told a press conference on his first working day after narrowly winning an election run - off saturday . ` ` seattle didn ' t disappear after boeing decided it would move , ' ' brown said . ` ` we have 20 other fortune 500 companies . . . . one company ' s problems will not impact the other strong companies we have . ' ' state officials were more forthcoming . texas governor rick perry directed the texas workforce commission to send rapid response teams to houston to begin assistance programs for fired workers , spokesman gene acuna said . enron filed yesterday for bankruptcy protection , the biggest such filing in u . s . history , after business began to collapse in october because it wrote off more than $ 1 billion in failed investments amid a $ 1 . 2 billion loss in shareholder equity . investors continued to lose confidence in the company when it restated more than four years of earnings . enron sought to merge with dynegy inc . , but that agreement fell through last week , forcing the largest energy trader to seek reorganization in bankruptcy court . enron shares , which have fallen 99 percent this year , rose 14 cents to 40 cents . dynegy , which is being sued for $ 10 billion by enron for breaking the merger agreement , fell $ 3 . 18 , or 10 percent , to $ 27 . 17 . tide of loss the tide of employees that emerged from enron ' s glass building monday , when the company told most of its workers to go home and await word on their jobs , may have repercussions throughout houston ' s downtown area , affecting new office projects as well as small businesses , houstonians said . the gateway newsstand , situated between enron and a large parking garage , would lose about 30 percent of its business if the energy trader were to cut all of its jobs , owner noor kamdar said . enron workers on lunch break usually crowd the shop for cigarettes , soft drinks and sandwiches . ` ` it has been slow just the past few days , like a holiday , ' ' kamdar said . ` ` i guess we will have to find a new crowd . ' ' houston ' s downtown has been the focus of an intense revitalization effort in recent years , as residential developers build expensive loft apartments and commercial builders construct four new office complexes . about 150 , 000 people work in downtown houston , said laura van ness , director of business development for economic development group central houston inc . the number of people living downtown grew 4 . 5 percent in 2001 , and is expected to increase 15 percent annually for the next five years , she said . office projects enron is completing a second office tower to match its mirrored headquarters . work on the project continues , with completion expected in mid - january , according to hines , the real estate company that ' s developing the project . enron today received permission from a bankruptcy judge to spend as much as $ 40 million to finish the tower . that will put about a million square feet of office space on the downtown market , said dan bellows , president of commercial broker staubach & co . ' s houston office . ` ` it ' ll definitely create a little more vacancy downtown , ' ' bellow said , who estimated vacancy rates could climb to 10 percent from 5 percent now . still , enron ' s buildings are expected to be in high demand in a market lacking large blocks of space for major new entrants . ` ` there are several large companies in this city who have already expressed interest in one or more of the buildings if they come available , ' ' bellows said . other major downtown office projects under construction are pre - leased to anchor tenants that include energy traders reliant inc . and calpine corp . , bellows said . development postponed work on all the projects continues . trammel crow co . , however , postponed its $ 108 million , 34 - story office development because of uncertainty about the impact enron ' s collapse will have on demand . perhaps the most visible loss to houston will be the prestige associated with the company ' s name , which adorns the downtown ballpark , enron field . the trader is among three of the city ' s most visible employers to hit hard times . layoffs were announced earlier this year at continental airlines inc . , where demand dropped following the attacks in new york and washington , and at compaq computer corp . , which is being bought by hewlett - packard co . ` ` if you ' re the ( chamber of commerce ) , you ' re out scrambling around for a new icon , ' ' said barton smith , an economist at the university of houston and director of the institute for regional forecasting . ` ` enron was the icon for houston for the new energy economy .

" ferc envisioned the introduction of competition , not only in its jurisdictional ( wholesale ) market . . . but also in the state jurisdictional retail market , and concluded that competition allowed it to expand its jurisdiction in three areas . " first , ferc asserted its jurisdiction over retail transactions when states " unbundled , " or separated , retail rates into charges for delivery and electricity . second , " ferc decided that if a seller of unbundled wholesale energy made use of a local distribution system , ferc - - not the states - - would set the rates that the seller would pay for the use of those . . . facilities , " new york said . third , ferc pre - empted the state ' s authority to set rates to recoup the costs " incurred by utilities to serve retail customers , that may be ' stranded ' ( unrecoverable by utilities ) due to competition , " the state said . the u . s . court of appeals for the d . c . circuit consolidated scores of challenges to the new regulations , including those from nine state commissions , and last june upheld all of ferc ' s actions . several losing parties , including new york , then asked the supreme court for a review . monday , the justices combined the new york case with one brought by energy giant enron power marketing and agreed to hear the case sometime next term . in its own brief to the supreme court on behalf of ferc , the justice department said a section of the federal energy act " explicitly gives ferc jurisdiction over ' all transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce ' and ' all facilities for such transmission ' regardless of whether the transmission is part of a wholesale or retail transaction . " besides , the department argued , a distinction between interstate and intrastate energy may be meaningless . in a 1972 ruling , fpc vs . florida light and 00 - 809 , enron vs . ferc ) by michael kirkland , upi legal affairs correspondent copyright 2001 by united press international . subject code : 02000000

2	Subject: exotica ( yet again ) hi guys i need some advice . sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions of exotica . at some point we will need to migrate london office over to your more up - to - date version , and i ' m concerned that there may be rac - style implications . i ' m in favour of using the it testers to carry out formal regression testing , and they are apparently able to do this . do we need to get our heads together to " form a view " before we involve rac or the business groups ? anjam tells sharad that london exotica was built using excel 95 , and that neither he nor zimin knows how to build / compile the xla using later versions of excel . is this true ? if so , then we need to migrate to xlls sooner rather than later because of the maintenance implications . steve

( enrononline ) represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  , clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels ) on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above , based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .  _

" there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved , " barone said . the writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company ' s operations went some way to appeasing wall street after a tumultuous year in which enron ' s stock lost about two - thirds of its value , but analysts said they were not about to let enron off the hook just yet . bear stearns analyst robert winters said he remained concerned about enron ' s quality of earnings and cash flow . winters said he believed enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns , but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk , which could adversely affect some of the company ' s financing arrangements . " problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain , particularly overseas , " he said . one such asset is enron ' s 65 percent stake , valued at $ 1 billion , in the dabhol power plant project in india , which has been stalled because of a long - running payments dispute with its only customer , a local utility company . enron ' s stock closed down $ 1 . 64 , or 4 . 85 percent , at $ 32 . 20 on wednesday . for the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period . enron was a wall street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured , new chief executive jeff skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the dabhol power plant project . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 1 - rto seen key to boosting new england power supply . by scott disavino 10 / 17 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 17 ( reuters ) - energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the u . s . northeast hinges , in part , on setting up a northeast regional transmission organization ( rto ) . rtos are predominantly for - profit groups established to bring all of a region ' s high - voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid . the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , which oversees the interstate wholesale power market , believes rtos will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers , in turn improving service and driving down rates . " if ferc can drive the northeast rto to closure in a reasonable period of time , it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation , " enron corp . ' s managing director of global government affairs , rick shapiro , told reuters . houston - based enron is the nation ' s top energy marketer . " how and when the rto gets implemented will radically impact the market . it ' s crucial to the development of the market in new england , " mirant corp . spokesman ray long told reuters . energy provider mirant , of atlanta , has 1 , 400 megawatts ( mw ) of generation in new england . the company is currently adding another 700 mw to its canal station in massachusetts . " once we get the permits for canal , we will reassess whether to proceed with the project . a big part of that assessment will depend on the rto process , " long said . the northeast rto ferc wants to see four super - regional rtos created in the u . s . - in the northeast , midwest , southeast and west . several regions have taken long strides toward developing rtos , including a not - for - profit model proposed in the midwest and rival for - profit plans vying for ferc approval in the west . ferc chairman patrick wood , seeking to spur the development of rtos , favors giving utilities until dec . 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market , though the commission has not voted on this plan . the northeast rto will include new england , new york , the pennsylvania - new jersey - maryland ( pjm ) region and possibly parts of eastern canada . ferc said it wants the northeast rto to be built on the pjm market platform and to include the best practices of the new england and new york markets . pjm interconnection , which operates the power grid in parts of pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland , delaware , virginia and washington , d . c . , is the nation ' s only fully functioning rto . " the process ferc set in place to establish one rto in pjm , new york and new england is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market , " long said . long said mirant determined a single northeast rto would save more than $ 440 million annually by eliminating the " artificial borders that now exist between new york , new england and pjm . " an administrative law judge , acting as a mediator for ferc , considered three proposals for creating the northeast rto . the three plans were proposed by interested parties , including mirant and enron , and the region ' s grid operators - the new york independent system operator ( iso ) in new york , iso new england in new england and pjm . last month , the judge asked the ferc to decide who will govern the northeast rto and what the timetable is to put the plan in place . the judge favored a plan put forward by the new york iso and iso new england . " if ferc implements the rto plan proposed by pjm in 2003 , consumers could save $ 1 . 5 billion . . . $ 440 million a year . . . over the new york / new england plan , which would not be implemented until 2006 , " long said . under the pjm plan , pjm would overlay its current market model across the entire region , while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets . " although nothing is perfect , pjm is widely accepted as the best market in the region . new york and new england , which are younger markets , are still works in progress with some bugs to work out , " enron ' s shapiro said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron seeks replacement for aga ' s gas storage report 10 / 17 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 713 - 547 - 9207 ; michael . rieke @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . financial post : news earnings : a few bright spots in the shadows yesterday ' s earnings national post 10 / 17 / 2001 national post national fp 2 ( c ) national post 2001 . all rights reserved . maytag corp . reported a third - quarter net loss of us $ 29 . 7 - million yesterday , but said sales of its maytag and amana home appliances exceeded forecasts . net income excluding charges was us 45 cents a share . delphi automotive systems corp . said third - quarter profit fell 82 % . third - quarter profit was us $ 26 - million , ( us 5 cents ) , a drop from us $ 148 - million ( us 26 cents ) in the third quarter of 2000 . revenue was us $ 6 . 23 - billion , down 6 % . enron corp . posted a third - quarter net loss as it chopped away at a tangled balance sheet with us $ 1 . 01 - billion in charges , offsetting strong returns from its core wholesale trading and marketing division . before charges profit was up 35 % . enron reported a net loss of us $ 638 - million ( us 84 cents ) , compared with year - earlier net income of us $ 271 - million , ( us 34 cents ) . netgraphe inc . , a montreal - based internet company , reported higher revenue and a reduced operating loss for its first quarter . but its net loss , which included depreciation , unusual items and amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions , rose to $ 11 . 7 - million , up from $ 10 . 97 - million . netgraphe is the online division of quebecor inc . tellabs inc . , a telecommunications equipment maker , reported a third - quarter plunge as revenue fell by half . the illinois - based company ' s results , including charges of us $ 60 - million , fell to a loss of us $ 49 . 47 - million ( usl 2 cents ) , compared with a profit of us $ 187 . 3 - million ( us 45 cents ) last year . cott corp . , the world ' s largest supplier of store - brand soft drinks , reported a 40 % rise in third - quarter profit , as beverage volumes soared nearly 25 % . for the quarter ended sept . 29 , toronto - based cott , with annual sales of nearly us $ 1 - billion last year , said it made a profit of us $ 11 . 1 - million ( usl 6 cents ) up from a profit of us $ 7 . 9 - million ( usl 2 cents ) in the previous year ' s quarter . sales during the quarter rose 15 % to us $ 302 . 5 - million from us $ 263 . 5 - million in the year - ago period . kraft foods inc . saw earnings rise 24 % in the third quarter , its second as a public company . it earned us $ 522 - million ( us 30 cents ) , compared with us $ 420 - million ( us 24 cents ) on a pro - forma basis , a year ago . revenue slipped to us $ 8 . 06 - billion from us $ 8 . 11 - billion a year earlier . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . bush to nominate kelliher to open ferc seat , white house says 2001 - 10 - 17 16 : 09 ( new york ) bush to nominate kelliher to open ferc seat , white house says washington , oct . 17 ( bloomberg ) - - president george w . bush will nominate joseph kelliher , a policy adviser to u . s . energy secretary spencer abraham , to fill the open seat on the federal energy regulatory commission , the white house said . if the senate approves kelliher , a former republican counsel for the house energy and commerce committee , the commission will have its full five members for the first time since pat wood , bush ' s first ferc appointee , became chairman sept . 1 . ` ` i hope they speed him through the process , ' ' said commissioner nora brownell , a republican who was appointed by bush earlier this year . ` ` he is a thoughtful person who knows how to work through issues . ' ' kelliher ' s nomination comes as the commission has pledged to closely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and natural gas markets and promote competition . in the next month or so , it is due to choose which groups will run the electric power grid around the country , an important step in deregulating the nation ' s power markets . a former power industry lobbyist , kelliher would fill the opening left by the departure of curt hebert , a republican appointed by president bill clinton and named chairman by bush . hebert left the commission aug . 31 to join entergy corp . after the white house made it clear bush planned to make wood the chairman . with kelliher , ferc will have three republicans and two democrats . ` ` kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team now working actively to finish the transition to truly competitive and dynamic power markets , ' ' said the electric power supply association , which represents competitive power sellers such as enron corp . the commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesale electricity and natural gas prices . energy regulators may loosen price caps on western power sales 2001 - 10 - 17 14 : 59 ( new york ) energy regulators may loosen price caps on western power sales washington , oct . 17 ( bloomberg ) - - federal regulators are considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in california and 10 western states , which power producers hope will allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight . the federal energy regulatory commission plans a public conference oct . 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula . the commission established caps in april and june , after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for california ' s largest utilities , units of pg & e corp . and edison international . ` ` we have heard and understand that people do think the solution was very california - centric , and it was , ' ' ferc chairman pat wood said , indicating changes in the formula are likely . ` ` but california ' s needs were very urgent at the time . ' ' while commissioners declined to say what they would be willing to change about the pricing formula , they want to fine - tune the caps before the winter , which is the peak period of demand and may yet cause another jump in prices , wood said . changes could be made next month . the current pricing formula is based on the most - expensive power generated in california . enron corp . , sierra pacific resources and other sellers of power to california want the formula to consider costs from all generators in the region . enron blamed the formula for a july 2 blackout in nevada , when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in california . lower power costs though the cost of wholesale power in california has dropped since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on april 25 , wood said the western states may face another shortage of power and high prices this winter . the pacific northwest depends on hydropower for much of its energy needs , and rainfall has been below normal this year . part of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the result of a drought that reduced power available from dams . ` ` i remain concerned about that part of the country , ' ' wood said . ` ` it has not been raining a whole lot out there . ' ' the average price for a megawatt - hour at the california - oregon border in september was $ 24 . 91 , down from $ 313 . 70 in april . a megawatt - hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average california homes for an hour . on the agenda for this month ' s conference is a proposal to link the formula to the price of natural gas , a fuel used in many generating plants . ` ` i ' m not predisposed for or against specific changes , ' ' said ferc commissioner nora brownell . the oct . 29 conference will help the commission determine aspects of the price control that the parties involved agree are working and those that are not , she said . surcharge in a related matter , the commission also may halt the 10 percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in california to cover the costs of collecting bad debt . the insolvent california utilities now have plans to pay off their debts . for power sellers in the west , the current price caps often require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss , enron , sierra pacific and other marketers said in statements to the commission . they said the price they sometimes pay for power is higher than the cost of supply from the most - expensive producer in california . ` ` the determination of the proxy price should not be limited to california generators , ' ' enron said in a government filing . it should be ` ` determined by the least - efficient generator in the entire west . ' ' power marketers also should be allowed to recover ` ` justifiable costs above the proxy prices , ' ' enron wrote . california officials had demanded the price controls after pg & e ' s pacific gas & electric and edison ' s southern california edison racked up more than $ 14 billion in power - buying losses . the caps were extended to other western states - - oregon , washington , arizona , nevada , wyoming , new mexico , colorado , montana , idaho and utah - - in june because some said generators in the west could simply get around the cap by selling outside california when prices were higher elsewhere . the caps don ' t expire until sept . 30 , 2002 , though they can be changed . california said before the price cap was extended to other states that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring states at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid blackouts . on july 2 , sierra pacific cut supplies to 10 , 000 customers for 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants were idled . it couldn ' t buy 50 megawatts of power in the spot market , partly because of suppliers ' concerns with the federal cap , company spokesman paul heagan said at the time . enron faces questions over limited partnerships , wsj reports 2001 - 10 - 17 10 : 11 ( new york ) houston , oct . 17 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is facing questions over agreements with two limited partnerships run by its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , the wall street journal reported . fastow set up ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp with the approval of enron ' s board . the partnerships have engaged in billions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with enron involving company assets and enron stock , the paper said . it isn ' t clear from u . s . securities and exchange commission filings what enron received in return . enron said about $ 35 million of its $ 1 . 01 billion charge reported yesterday was connected with the partnerships and involves the ` ` early termination . . . of certain structured finance arrangements , ' ' the paper said . chief executive officer kenneth lay said in an earlier interview that related transactions involving top managers aren ' t unusual , the paper said . according to the arrangement , the general partner , made up of fastow and at least one other enron employee , received a management fee of as much as 2 percent annually of the total amount invested , the paper said , citing the ljm 2 offering document . fastow declined to comment , the paper said .

2	Subject: the greatest is love dear friend , as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is umaru aliyu , a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer caring for my health . it has defiled all forms of medicine , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i did on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this my self any more . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seems not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars $ 24 , 000 , 000 , that i have with a bank / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . please indicate your intention to help through this email address ( aliyuumaru @ mail 2 world . com ) immediately . and always remember that i have set aside 20 % for you for your time and patience . i await your urgent response to this request . thanks may god bless you and your family ( amen ) . thanks regards mr umaru aliyu este mail ha sido enviado desde donde los alvarado - http : / / www . alvarado . cl

2	Subject: clickpaper . com confirming entity discussions over the last several days with legal and tax have resulted in a change to the legal entity we ' ll use for the " trading " portion of clickpaper . com activity . as long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is . . . . . . a . for click match activity clickpaper . com can still be used as planned . simply , we ' ll only be invoicing for transaction fees . b . for click trade activity the following will happen . 1 . physical trading that occurs at any north american hub developed by clickpaper . com , enron north america , corp . ( ena ) will be the confirming entity . i have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as a " clickpaper . com on - line transaction " . 2 . physical trading that occurs at any hub developed for the u . k . , latin america , or asia , has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes . my desire is that we follow the legal entity structure used by eol on - line trading for hubs in similar countries . we ' ll work that out soon . strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most significant is a much simplified mid / back - office effort in order to support clickpaper on - line business . we no longer need to be concerned about setting up more portfolio / book i . d . ' s for risk books as on - line deals can go into the same risk books used today for pulp and paper . intercompany transactions between clickpaper . com and ena are now eliminated for on - line trades which simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial reporting / reconcilation activity that would be required by using clickpaper . com as the entity . if our one to many model is successful , we move to a many to many model . at that point , all of this changes . so for now , enjoy ! for now , jeff harbert

2	Subject: london risk reporting well , today ( or rather yesterday ) it happened . we have been pushing our limits hard and the makets here have been very volatile . we had a large increase in north american natural gas var due to the breaking apart the rockies / socal basis correlation . this am , we were attempting to get firm numbers on the effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide jeff / delainey / lavorato / buy / . . . . the information to make decisions whether or not to reduce positions . the number was not firm until 11 am houston time . my understanding is that the houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that we were waiting for london . while i am sure that there are issues all around and i do not think that anyone senior in houston is even aware , let alone prepared to blame , i fear that this will not always be the case . i think something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in the future . please do not take this as a nasty - gram . no one is cc ' d or bcc ' d . i just think that it will be deemed unacceptable . any thoughts / comments ? ted

2	Subject: [ ilug ] michael ! ilug ilug , from ; mr . michael kamah and family , johannesburg , south africa . my dear , good day . this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you . but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you , and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires . i got your contact information from your country ' s information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes . my name is mr . michael kamah , the second son of mr . smith kamah , of beitbridge zimbabwe . at the height of the present political crises in our country , in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president , mr . robert g . mugabe , in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country , my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13 th of february , 2002 , in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house . my father , during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries . he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr . robert mugabe and his followers , which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts . that not being enough , the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and ! confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes [ that included my fathers assets and accounts ] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers , along with the assets of these white farmers themselves , that are being presently confiscated . i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa , where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood . during my fathers life on earth , he had deposited the sum of eight million and six hundred thousand united states dollars [ $ 8 . 600 . 000 . 00 ] , in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers , awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination , which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day . in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father , and with the present clamp down , killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country , i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally , to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugabe ' s ! regime . my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit . now this is what i actually want you to do for me ; 1 . i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose , with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office . 2 . to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years . please , i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now , and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with . and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request , i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help . thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request . best regards , mr . michael kamah and family . - - irish linux users ' group : ilug @ linux . ie http : / / www . linux . ie / mailman / listinfo / ilug for ( un ) subscription information . list maintainer : listmaster @ linux . ie

2	Subject: please respond banque international du burkina , avenue dimdolobsom 01 bp 6565 ouaga 01 , ouagadougou , burkina faso . dear friend i am mrs clemence offia , manager ( treasury ) of banque international du burkina . ( bib ) this is an urgent and very confidential business proposition . i am writing to seek your cooperation over this business deal . in my department , i discovered an abandoned sum of us $ 12 , 300 , 000 . 00 , ( twelve million , three hundred thousand dollars ) only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that took place in kenya , east africa , the late dr . george brumley , a citizen of atlanta , united states of america but resident in burkina faso , west africa and a physician . since we got information about his death , we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim . it is therefore upon this discovery that i now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money could go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill . the banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years , the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund . the request for your assistance and maximum co - operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner . 40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner , in respect to the provision of a foreign account . 10 % will be set aside for the expenses that may be incurred during the business and 50 % would be for me . there after i will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated . therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged , you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to the deceased , indicating your claims and where the money will be remitted . upon receipt of your reply , i will send to you by fax or email the text of application which you will fill and submit to the office of the foreign remittance director of the banque international du burkina . i will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is strictly confidential and i will use my position in this bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund . please , visit the website below for more information about the plane crash and the tragic death of the deceased and his entire family , late dr . george brumley . awaiting your urgent reply thanks and my regards . mrs clemence offia . n / b . please reply through my alternative email address indicated below ; offiafamily @ yahoo . com 
2	Subject: proposed retention bonuses for netco louise , i am sorry to bother you at such a critical time , because i know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter . however , i felt like i had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following . dave forster & i met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group . i was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual . i was allowed to move dollars but not allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group . frankly , the numbers seemed pretty low . assuming the goal is to retain key employees for netco , i am not confident these numbers will achieve this . i know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company . i have asked them to be patient , not make any quick decisions , and give us a chance to see this through . dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations . as you know , mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end . the mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end . i understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available . however , because the retention numbers were based on this , they are significantly lower . my intentions are not to show any disrepect to dave by discussing this with you but i wanted to make sure my thoughts / opinions were communicated to you . if dave has already discussed this with you , i apologize for the duplication . if you have any questions , please feel free to call me . i am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713 - 446 - 9669 . thank you for your time . jennifer

2	Subject: hpl sale - energy operations task list i talked with anne koehler in legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from energy operations prior to the effective sale of hpl . anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term " protocol " into these discussions . to clarify , according to anne , the " protocol " is not anticipated to be a formal legal document . instead , anne envisions simply e : mails or memos between enron and aep with regard to any sharing of information , agreements on processes to be followed in the transition , etc . operational details to be decided between enron and aep have been handled exactly in that manner to date , with e : mails being sent from bob ball ( enron ) to steve jackson ( aep ) . only critical changes to the purchase and sale agreement will be formally documented . bob hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original purchase and sale agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of may . he has worked with enron ' s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with sandi braband in legal to document this change to the purchase and sale agreement as an amendment to that agreement . as of today , legal has completed revisions to that amendment and anne koehler is sending it to mary perkins in enron ' s treasury group for her review . upon mary ' s review , anne will forward the amendment to aep for their review before final signatures . we devised this week a new format for incorporating the aep - hpl transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you . this new format incorporates the various memos and e : mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues . items that only require actions by enron will be our " to do " list . each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress . those items that fall under the aep list or which appear in both the enron and aep list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to aep and / or their agreement via the e : mails or memos as suggested by ann koehler . i believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written " protocol " . we will also update you weekly on the status of those e : mails and / or memos between ourselves and aep . i understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the hpl sale . to provide clarity for these update meetings , may i suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches : 1 ) brian and i hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status , or 2 ) i attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you . please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week .

" related - party transactions " is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars . mr . fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments . the journal reported us $ 35 - million of its third - quarter loss of us $ 638 - million were connected with the limited partnerships curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , " most notably in telecommunications , " have declined precipitously . " investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , " launer said . some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke . " this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , " said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .

" questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses . the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading . according to the annual report the " related party transactions " , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively . mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were . they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp . " we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , " added mr lay . the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions . enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating . an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion . the sec inquiry is " informal " , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment . enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 10 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on " certain related - party transactions " that had been previously disclosed to the sec . " we welcome this request , " said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive . " we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , " he said . the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water . investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn . in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning . skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure . on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments . but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the " early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . " in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions . but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion . the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported . lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed . a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court . many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say . investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses . and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released . analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a " hold " from a " buy " rating monday out of such frustration . coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron . but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong . " i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , " he said . investors are panicking because of a " bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , " said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

2	Subject: ferc ' s prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for ca wholesale electric markets the following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission meeting held tonight at approximately 7 pm est and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting by joe hartsoe : physical withholding - - to prevent physical withholding , the plan will require sellers with pga ' s to offer all their available power in real time . all california generators , even those not subject to ferc price regulation , will be required to sell into the iso ' s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso ' s interstate transmission lines . hydroelectric facilities will be exempted . ( 24 - 7 for lyr ) price mitigation - the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market . during stage 1 , 2 and 3 emergencies in the iso ' s real time market , each generator ( other than hydro ) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator ' s heat curve , emission rates , gas costs and emission costs , plus $ 2 for o emissions are to be based on cammon fitzgerald ( ? ) . the gas cost and emissions will be published the day after , for use on the following day . a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators . highest bid sets the clearing price . each gas fired generator must file with ferc and the iso , on a confidential basis , heat and emission rates for each generating unit . the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator , including maintenance and operating costs . in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price , the generator must , within 7 days of the end of each month , file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price . ferc has 60 days to review / act . no opportunity costs in real time . marketers are in the same boat , as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost . however , credit sleeves are permissible . demand response - beginning june 1 , only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids . ferc is attempting to break the demand curve . ( 24 - 7 ) outages - - pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the commission staff proposal adopted by ferc . term - order expires one year from date of issuance . rto filing - california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 or order lapses with no further effect . iso reporting - on september 14 , 2001 , iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built . comments are due in 15 days . quarterly reports thereafter . revocation of market based rate authority and refunds - the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1 ) no physical withhold of capacity , and 2 ) no inappropriate bidding behavior . inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior . an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate . in addition , " hockey stick " bids are expressly prohibited ( i . e . bidding 95 % at marginal cost and 5 % at a much higher level ) . limited 206 filing - applies to sales in the wscc , outside california . refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7 % . control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs . apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified . all marketers and non - hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity / energy to a location within wscc . ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california . comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations . the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the order . nox limits in california - - must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law . however , it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement - just include the fines as part of the price bid . also if nox is limited , may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price . surcharge to pay past amount due - - comments are due in 30 days on 1 ) whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2 ) the effect this surcharge would have on the pg & e bankruptcy filing . no mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from california . the order is not finally drafted as of yet , and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the final order . we will keep you posted . ra

2	Subject: i ' m sure you guys have seen most of this , but may pick up some storage information , etc . bush administration extends emergency supply orders despite recent indications that the bush administration would take a more hands - off approach to the california crisis , energy secretary spencer abraham late yesterday gave pg & e and southern california edison another two weeks of breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power suppliers to continue supplying the cash - strapped utilities . the emergency gas order now expires at 3 a . m . ( est ) feb . 7 . in granting the extensions , abraham urged the state to get to work to solve its own problems . he said only california can implement the policies necessary to resolve the short - term and long - term supply challenges . " our action today is designed to give the governor , the california legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action . i strongly urge the parties to act immediately , " said abraham . he also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas . despite the action , pg & e said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued jan . 19 . " the gas supply situation is [ not good ] , " utility spokeswoman staci homrig said yesterday afternoon . " we are quickly depleting our storage . even under the order , j . aron & co . [ a subsidiary of goldman sachs ] has not delivered gas . they represent about 9 % of our daily needs ( 1 . 5 bcf / d in january ) . " oh yeah , we ' ve been in contact with them , " she said . " we ' ve been in contact with the doe , too . the other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order . they are sempra energy trading and western gas resources . " homrig said pg & e expected doe to take legal action against those who didn ' t resume deliveries . the order applied to 27 gas suppliers , all of which supplied gas to pg & e within the last 30 days . " there ' s not a lot i can say , " said j . aron spokeswoman kate baum . " j . aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order . that ' s my statement . i can neither confirm nor deny anything else . " meanwhile , other suppliers who were not among those on the doe ' s list , were staying as far away from california as possible . " all i know is we ' re not selling in california any more . a person could get fired around here for doing that , " said one marketer . " all we had in california were a few spot deals that expired at the end of december . needless to say we didn ' t re - up them . " without the doe ' s order , pg & e would be back where it was last week , with some suppliers stopping delivery , others planning to stop at the end of their contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the utility . pg & e has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply under such a scenario until the first week in february . homrig said pg & e ' s storage currently is well below 50 % full , or less than 16 bcf and depleting rapidly by about 500 mmcf / d to 1 bcf / d . pg supplies remain tight depending on your perspective , california either moved toward future solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for long - term , fixed - price supplies . the auction began yesterday and will run through noon today . the state is seeking sealed bids for six - month , three - year , five - year and 10 - year supply agreements . whether results of the auction would be made public was still unclear yesterday , but the results are expected to be given to legislators , who now are debating various long - term solutions in the state senate . a spokesperson in the state assembly speaker ' s office said the legislature is basically " standing by , " awaiting more price information . action on the proposed comprehensive legislation , including the question of the state taking over the private utilities ' hydroelectric systems , should come by the end of the week . merrill lynch said yesterday it was " increasingly skeptical " that the " securitization for hydro " plan would go forward . it has received " muted support , " merrill lynch said , and has not been drafted as a bill yet . recent revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract flexibility , with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of $ 55 / mwh , which is well below the utilities retail rate caps ( edison at $ 72 . 40 / mwh and pg & e at $ 66 ) . the difference is expected to be used to pay down the utilities ' debt . meanwhile , the electric system limped along under the specter of another stage three yesterday , but without rolling blackouts , and elsewhere indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written off california from their prospective marketing lists . " we ' re not selling in california any more , a person could get fired for doing that around here , " said one texas - based gas marketer , referring to the continuing credit problems of pacific gas and electric co . , which has been hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas side , too . in the meantime , southern california edison co . is back in federal district court in los angeles , where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks ago . this time it is asking for the court to force the california public utilities commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale cost of power . calling the action with the court " a last resort , " edison said it has tried to get the rate situation resolved , but at every turn it has met " resistance , denial and finger - pointing " by the cpuc ' s five - member governor - appointed board . the cpuc on tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the environmental review of the ongoing case looking at pg & e ' s hydro utility assets . " the current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony , " the cpuc said in a prepared statement .

mg plc is a leading , independent international metals trading business , which provides a variety of services to the global metals industry . the business dates back to 1881 when it was the german metallgesellschaft group and was active in trading metals from its head office in frankfurt . today , mg is one of the world  , s top non - ferrous metals brokers and market makers , the world  , s leading independent copper merchant and a leading merchant of many other non - ferrous metals . mg is comprised of two core areas of expertise , the financial services and merchanting divisions . the financial services division was formed in 1970 to provide market - making and trading services to the mg  , s physical metals trading business through futures trading as a member of the london metal exchange and , at a later date , as a member of comex in new york . in the late 1980 s , as a result of london  , s growing leading role in the metals industry , mg established a merchant trading office in london . in 1986 , mg developed its warehousing division with the acquisition of henry bath . in 1999 , the merchanting and financial services divisions , including warehousing , were combined into a single company , which was floated on the london stock exchange . currently , mg  , s core trading offices are located in london and new york with warehouse operations in liverpool , humberside , rotterdam , new orleans , new haven , and singapore . it has merchanting offices in lima , santiago , los angeles , chicago , stockholm , cologne , hamburg , frankfurt , new delhi , shanghai , beijing , hong kong , seoul , tokyo and melbourne . what does the merchanting division do ? the merchanting division is the world  , s leading independent copper merchant , one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nickel and one of the leading european merchants of recycled non - ferrous metals . the division also trades in other non - ferrous metals on the london metals exchange ( lme ) , including lead , tin , zinc , aluminium and brass . the merchanting division engages in the following main activities : ? merchanting of non - ferrous metals  ) mg trades as a principal with producers and consumers , buying and selling non - ferrous metals and concentrates ( particularly copper , aluminium and nickel ) , exchanging qualities and locations and lending and borrowing metals . ? global stockholding  ) mg holds stocks of non - ferrous metals at warehouses around the world . ? merchanting of recycled metal  ) mg trades as a principal with suppliers and consumers of non - ferrous metal for recycling . ? terminal market operations  ) mg participates in the lme and comex using hedging , arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting activity . what does the financial services division do ? the financial services division is one of the leading lme members and , based on the volume of lme metals stored , is one of the leading lme metals warehousing businesses . the financial services division engages in the following main activities : ? brokerage activities  ) mg executes orders as a broker for clients in lme and comex contracts . ? market - making  ) mg is a market - maker for both futures and options contracts and comex and otc contracts . ? warehousing  ) mg stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in europe , the united states and asia . mg has also begun to prepare to trade non - ferrous metals using the internet as its platform . on 10 th february , mg announced the formation of a joint venture with internet capital group , inc . and safeguard international fund , l . p . to develop an internet marketplace for trading non - ferrous metals . the joint venture , called emetra , intends to establish a world - wide business - to - business , e - commerce trading platform for the non - ferrous metals markets , including physical trading and the trading of futures and options contracts . why is enron acquiring mg ? enron is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesale markets . by expanding into new wholesale markets , such as non - ferrous metals , enron expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which link different commodities and inputs . mg will provide enron with a number of important benefits . at the same time , enron expects that mg will significantly benefit from its association with enron . some of the benefits we envisage include : ? the opportunity to combine enron  , s core competencies in trading , finance and origination with mg  , s global position in trading non - ferrous metals . ? the ability for both enron and mg to access new clients , particularly in the united states and europe . ? the ability to cross - market both existing products and new products such as bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing . ? the ability to leverage the opportunities available to mg by increasing its financial strength and the resources available to it . ? the chance to overlay the enrononline business - model on the metals industry to increase liquidity and contract market share . what remains to be done ? merging the business operations of two entities , even highly motivated companies such as enron and mg , has been and will continue to be a formidable and daunting exercise . having a shared vision facilitates rapid integration , but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain . during the conditional offer period , enron and mg are taking steps to prepare for a seamless and non - disruptive integration of our respective operations . ideally , when enron  , s offer to buy all mg shares becomes unconditional ( 15 july 2000 is the current target date ) , the two can hit the ground with their feet running . in the short term , a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate that smooth transition . most importantly , in order to ensure that the deal goes forward , enron and mg will work to remove the remaining conditions to enron  , s offer , including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders as well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents . a number of other steps must be taken , however , during the first phase of our integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track . integration activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations : commercial matters , financial matters , middle and back office issues ; and , most importantly , on the employees of both organisations . some of the most important goals relating to each of these areas are : commercial ? developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on enrononline and installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data transfers and information flows between mg and enron . ? preparing a joint venture management plan for mg ' s interest in emetra that is consistent with enron  , s goal of listing physical metal contracts on enrononline . ? identifying opportunities to - combine enron ' s core competencies in trading , finance , and origination with mg ' s global position in trading non - ferrous metals ; - leverage mg  , s position by increasing its financial strength and resources available to it ; - cross - market both existing and new products to enron and mg customers , particularly in the us and europe ; and - grow mg ' s metal trading franchise . financial ? obtaining waivers from mg ' s banks in respect of change of control in loan or other agreements . ? preparing plans to integrate cash management functions and putting in place funding arrangements for august 2000 onwards . ? preparing plans to arrange large - scale inventory securitisation to reduce balance sheet debt before year - end . middle and back office ? preparing financial information necessary to understand and maximise integration benefits including , pro - forma consolidated financial statements ; profit and loss budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 2000 ; and integration budgets . ? determining the feasibility of integrating accounting systems ( as 400 , sap ) . ? assessing mg ' s core trading and risk profiles and developing plans to incorporate risk profiles in mg ' s metals books into enron systems . ? evaluating it systems and infra - structure at all mg office + warehouse locations and preparing budgets and programmes to provide mg staff with access to enron it systems and applications . people ? preparing a programme to co - locate mg ' s london staff ( 145 ) at enron house over the weekend of 16 / 17 september . ? developing plans to harmonize compensation , benefits , and employment policies and practices ; developing plans for staff reporting relationships . ? communicating plans and status of activities at all levels of enron ' s and mg ' s organizations . ? arranging introductions between enron and mg staff and providing opportunities for information exchanges . where do we go from here ? i believe that enron  , s acquisition of mg is an exciting opportunity for us all . while a number of steps remain to be taken , we have already successfully begun the integration of enron and mg . by remaining enthusiastic and committed to this process , i expect that this transition will proceed smoothly and with a minimum of difficulty . summary of mg offices / staff worldwide location employee headcount location employee headcount brazil canada chicago chile edinburgh frankfurt germany hamburg hong kong houston k ?

2	Subject: offce x * p professional $ 60 minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack " indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

( manager - accounts ) and heidi hellman ( commercial associate & person responsible for setting up the mid & back office functions ) from the indian office in regards to their expected coal , power , liquid fuels , and gas transactions . we based the discussion around the checklist ( copy attached below ) . the following is a summary of the meeting . india is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any contracts yet . heidi and milind believe that in the near term india will only be doing a few structured deals and no trading . heidi , milind and i went over the checklist together and the results indicate that there is still a lot to do before india commences activities . they have talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized anything as of yet . also , i ' m not sure they yet appreciate the number of processes and procedures that must be established before any transactions have commenced . i politely told milind that the enron way is to have systems , processes , procedures and controls established before any deals have commenced and that we have to make sure this happens . lastly , there are certain things that they told me that i ' m a bit worried about ( the first is that a commercial person is responsible for setting up controls and processes ) . i would like to talk to each about some of these as well as about what involvement you have had with india to date and what involvement you may have on an ongoing basis . regards shona

2	Subject: call hi louise , welcome back ! i trust everything is ok at home ? how are you coping ? my assistant told me that you tried to call me . . . . . . . . what ' s the subject ? , general catch - up ? , want to know what zhiyong wants to see you for , pick up where we left off ? i imagine you must also be very busy , so soon after your return to work . . . so here ' s a start . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . where we left off . . . just before you left , i tried to get to see you to discuss the whole consolidation of gas systems issue . we ' ve been working through something called gas trading vision 2 , which in my mind wasn ' t really a " vision " , but more of a series of " fixes " to the exisitng systems . i had got some overview flow diagrams completed for all the gas systems , and after asking lots of questions about how these systems evolved , started drawing some conclusions about why we appear to be in such a state . apart from the obvious overlap of our several gas systems , it occured to me that our huge team size had quite a lot to do with sheer number of technologies employed as well as the the sheer number of moving inter - related parts . for each technology employed , that skill set has to be present in the team supporting it , and most of the time these guys are not mult - skilled , so we end up with lots of individual skill sets that can ' t be transfered easily . what i wanted to propose , was a serious , incremental effort , to consolidate the systems and to decommission the old ones as we went along . this would free up resources , and with a smaller technology set make them more responsive and flexible so they could be used to add value . note : this is not a sitara 2 , not big bang . . . . this is an incremental approach . . . . while you ' ve been gone , we ' ve been getting together to discuss this , ( a lot harder than expected ! ) , and have started to make a stab at identifying the component pieces , technology choices , biggest commercial impact etc . . . . and have some pre - liminary direction . is this something you would back ? . . . . or am i wasting my time ? ( before you write this off completely , i would like the opportunity of talking to you about it zhiyong wei . . . he is probably going to ask you where you stand on project initiatives like the one above , as well as ask you what your overall vision is for the gas trading systems . regards steve

2	Subject: california update 7 / 25 / 01 p . 3 details are still rough and the situation is very fluid , but here is what is currently going on : senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb 78 xx and ab 82 xx . upon an initial read , it appears that they are doing the following : ab 82 xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio . ( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated . it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known . at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , " as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . " this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .

2	Subject: qf projects summary all projects are owned in a trs / foe structure ( total return swap / friend of enron ) as a result of our continued ownership in portland general . the two current east project companies are motown and cornhusker . motown consists of two 50 % interests and has trs of about $ 56 million and is on the balance sheet for about $ 2 million : michigan power - 129 mw power plant fully contracted for power 20 + years and 14 remaining years of fixed cost gas . the ppa is deep in the money versus cost to generate ( even after the swapped gas in 2015 ) . dynegy operates and is managing general partner ( " mgp " ) and operator . fair performance record on both at best . michigan is currently entering into qf stranded cost filings and the time is near to propose a restructuring . we have waited for about 9 months as doug clifford ( the origination on the purchase ) had been attempting to purchase dynegy ' s interest ( they have too high a book value and are accrual based ) . the proposed restructuring will take the form of an upfront payment in return for an option to provide power from the market . this approach gives consumer ' s ( a bbb credit ) much needed cash at a time when they are significantly underrecovering due to increased fuel costs and set fuel recovery rates . consumer ' s ( like many other utilities ) has a hard time seeing their exposure ( purchased power cost certainty for the volume and term ) and doesn ' t see any regulatory filing complications with their current stranded cost filings . the amended ppa is a non - unit contingent power short which we fill long - term with a contract from the power desk . the desk takes the obligation because generation investments provides a full backstop pricing through their ownership of the plant and the swapped gas ( we either float past the swapped gas or contract for differences those years with the gas desk ) . the ppa and desk contract are securitized in the capital markets for the term of the ppa at 1 . 05 dscr and about 75 bps over consumer ' s current corporate bonds . the plant essentially becomes a $ 0 npv machine and the power desk has significant optionality to call from the market rather than the plant for 20 + years . during the term of the swapped gas , when the plant isn ' t called by the desk we can sell the gas into the market for a profit . it is fairly easy to see the increased value . the project is currently project financed at about 1 . 5 dscr for about 14 years ( lots of cash ) . the desk has significant optionality and always a matched cost supply with the plant . the plant gains efficiency due to revised o & m , insurance , reserves , etc . which are no longer required due to the removal of project financing . difficulties - dynegy and consumers . consumers can be rational . dynegy either must sell or play along . current operational / project management issues which dynegy caused may make their interest available . ada - 29 mw plant fully contracted for power 20 + years . enron is the mgp . ge operates for us . 50 % owned by coned . fixed gas through 2008 . we would propose a restructuring at the same time as michigan power ( this would leave consumers with only one unrestructured ppa ) . currently revisiting buying comed ' s interest . cornhusker - trs of about $ 206 and about $ 24 on balance sheet . a 100 % interest in a single 250 mw plant in texas . small coop which is very litigious . plant has had some rather spectacular failures ( i have pictures which make the engineers on our floor shudder which i would be glad to pass along ) but the ppa only requires 60 % availability before significantly in the money capacity payments are reduced ( essentially an impossible to reach loss ) . the failures have been related ( westinghouse 501 f ) . carl tricoli spent the first 7 months ( upto february ) trying to sell the project to the coop . we spent last month determining that the coop will never buy the project ( they just don ' t have the $ and we are a very expensive lender . we ' re taking a last stab at a restructuring proposal in the coming month and upon appraisal of the coop ' s intentions , we ' ll potentially enter the sell mode . el paso has indicated an interest in the project already as the ex - citizen ' s employee ' s over there attempted to restructure some time ago . if we sell the closing should be by 9 / 30 / 01 . again , i apologize for the delay in getting you this info . call with questions . chuck

" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive " promotion . " at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron designated as " professional meteorologist . " in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a " new - hire " to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion .

' s share price hovered above seven - year lows touched in earlier trade monday after moody ' s investor service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of north america ' s largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status . enron , the largest electricity and natural gas trader in north america , also on monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks . enron shares were down $ 1 . 40 , or 9 . 03 percent , to $ 14 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after earlier in the session trading below $ 14 for the first time since december 1994 . moody ' s also warned that it could cut the debt rating again , now downgraded to baa 2 , as well as its rating for the enron ' s commercial paper . enron ' s credit - worthiness will have a direct affect on its day - to - day trading operations and its trading partners ' perception of making good on trades . with a credit rating hovering above junk status , the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades . last week enron shares lost almost $ 14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company ' s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out . investors have fled enron ' s stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off - the - balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow in deals the u . s . securities and exchange commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest . enron compensated its partners in this off - balance sheet structure with the promise of enron shares , if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level . many industry observers see enron ' s request for additional credit , after the company tapped its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week , as a sign a weakness .

" particularly in light of september 11 , the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes , " said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . " a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year . " rating reviews are significant because , unlike actual rating changes , they are not a " lagging " indicator , and suggest the future direction of corporate credit . moody ' s normally wraps up its reviews within three months . u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening u . s . economy , an inability of marginal companies to raise cash , debt - financed merger activity and fallout from the sept . 11 attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance , and travel . for example , moody ' s in july warned it may cut comcast corp . ' s ratings after the philadelphia - based company bid $ 44 . 5 billion for at & t corp . ' s cable tv operations . then last month , moody ' s warned it may cut chicago - based boeing co . ' s ratings because of the attacks ' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes . in the third quarter , moody ' s warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative - grade , or " junk " - rated , companies , and raise the ratings of just 11 . for investment - grade companies , the gap was even more yawning : 68 - to - 11 . and in the fourth quarter ? through friday , moody ' s warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four . on monday , it downgraded embattled energy trading giant enron corp . , and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade . puchalla , however , said the decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively . " lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , " he said . " that is a positive for credit quality . " the third quarter was the 14 th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades . the record is 19 quarters , set between 1988 and 1993 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel ) 2001 - 10 - 29 12 : 16 ( new york ) enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel ) ( updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which can ' t get low - interest , short - term loans , faces skeptical lenders who will demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader tries to get cash in the bank , credit analysts said . ` ` anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous , ' ' said sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . ` ` it ' s likely that lenders are going to demand collateral .

' s ( ene ) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks . why the talk of a " death spiral " for north america ' s premier energy trading company ? the stock price of cisco systems inc . ( csco ) , for example , saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12 - month period . nobody questioned the viability of cisco . the difference is that over the past few years , enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question . if you ' re buying network components , you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier . after all , you ' re buying something you can touch . but if you ' re buying power or gas , what you ' re really buying is a commitment to deliver . if your supplier doesn ' t come through when the market gets tough , you ' re left totally exposed . in enron ' s energy trading business , then , credibility at every level is critical . for now , enron looks to be more than viable . but the company ' s asset - light strategy might not be . gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1 . 65 % in the third quarter from 5 . 26 % in the first quarter of 1998 . meanwhile , asset - heavy energy companies like mirant corp .

( cpn ) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure . two weeks ago , enron reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , resulting from $ 1 . 01 billion in write - offs . that didn ' t send investors running , however . in fact , its stock price rose a bit on the news . what hurt was the disclosure that enron had reduced its net assets , or " shareholders ' equity , " by $ 1 . 2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . that , along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the securities 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . official correction enron long - term ratings downgraded to baa 2 - moody ' s 10 / 29 / 2001 afx news ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd ( moody ' s corrected its stance on enron ratings to a downgrade ) new york ( afx ) - moody ' s investors service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long - term debt ratings of enron corp from baal to baa 2 following a deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments . the long - term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade , moody ' s said . moody ' s also placed the company ' s prime - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade . moody ' s initially placed enron ' s long - term debt ratings on review on oct 16 . the write - downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of enron ' s share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper , according to moody ' s . in response to these events , moody ' s said enron has shored up its near - term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper , leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1 . 2 bln usd . moody ' s said it plans to focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties . aw / gc for more information and to contact afx : www . afxnews . com and www . afxpress . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : moody ' s cuts enron to 2 notches above " junk " . 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - moody ' s investors service on monday cut embattled energy trading giant enron corp .

" i think enron ' s approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow , " said the head of risk management at one uk utility that halted its trade with enron last week . " they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , " he said . " the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . " a spokesman for enron ' s european headquarters in london headquarters declined to comment . reluctance to trade with enron in europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five - year lows . triggering the slide was news last week the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer . houston - based enron trades a large amount of its volume in the u . s . and europe through its internet enrononline system . last friday the company said trade on enrononline was above average levels with more than 8 , 400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $ 4 billion . traders said enron ' s plight could hit liquidity in european gas and power markets , where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years . one industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the uk electricity market had put on hold their trading enron , which is among the biggest five traders in the market . in mainland europe , where enron has been a major driver of liquidity , potential counterparties are treading with care . " we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , " said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named . french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning .

( ene ) , the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money . but it won ' t be traders who will cash in on this new potential . it will be class - action attorneys . they ' re already lining up to sue enron in at least five shareholder suits . as of oct . 25 , two of lawsuits had been filed against enron in federal court and three more in texas state court . most of them name as defendants ken lay , enron ' s longtime chairman , former chief executive jeff skilling and andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence oct . 25 . still another suit , which isn ' t a class action suit , was filed naming as defendants members of enron ' s board of directors . all the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships enron set up , many of them managed by fastow . most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with enron . the transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband , water and other enron investments . fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions . as enron ' s chief financial officer , he was being paid to manage the corporation ' s finances . as general partner of two ljm partnerships , he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with enron . he shared in profits of those partnerships . when investors began demanding information about the transactions , enron ' s share price began to slide . with the heat on , enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $ 544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals , among other things . that ' s when the class action attorneys went to work . so far , at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs . enron didn ' t respond to calls asking about the lawsuits . among the law firms representing plaintiffs is milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach , which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit . the release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $ 30 billion from class action lawsuits . the lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market . some of the deals with the ljm partnerships run by fastow " purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market , " according to abrams and franks v . enron et al . that could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months . market skeptics have said enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth . enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties , a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year , according to enron . now market watchers will want to know if any of enron ' s trades were done with the ljm partnerships managed by fastow . they will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with chewco investments . that houston company , according to a report in the wall street journal , was managed by michael kopper and was set up in 1997 when kopper was a managing director with enron ' s global equity markets group . he left enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by fastow . do the plaintiffs ' attorneys know whether enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships ?

2	Subject: ncpa br is back hey guys . i had a long talk with ncpa today and set up so that we again can do the zp 26 / npl 5 buy - resale on a realtime basis . we are not doing a profit split this time , we are paying them $ 25 / mw instead . this basically enables us to shift 21 mw across pathl 5 and not be subject to congestion as ncpa has grandfather rights across the path . this is a sweet strategy when the spl 5 / npl 5 spread is there and pathl 5 is congested . ncpa ' s capacity is 21 mw , but i would not recommend doing more than 20 mw . there are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it ( wesco especially ) . so by doing only 20 mw we do not remind them of ncpa . the way this works is that we call ncpa and ask their capacity across pathl 5 . and tell them you want to schedule the br through whatever hour . in caps : we sell to ncpa in zp 26 . we buy from ncpa in npl 5 . we can buy spl 5 to fill our zp 26 sale ( we just shift the load from spl 5 to zp 26 , so enter a epmi calpool ) . pg & e is ncpa ' s sc , so if you are not passing phase two give them a call . ncpa ' s tel # : ( 916 ) 786 - 3520 pg & e tel # : ( 415 ) 973 - 1969 if you guys have any questions just ask me . geir

2	Subject: organizational changes changes in enron ' s business require us to reevaluate how we approach the engineering and construction function within enron . specifically , enron energy services ' ( ees ) business has grown dramatically and that requires considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers . additionally , in light of enron ' s continued emphasis on increasing our return on invested capital , we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction projects around the world . historically , these projects have been a primary focus of eecc ' s activities . consequently we are making the following organizational changes concerning eecc : eecc ' s pipeline construction group , led by jerry martin , will become part of enron transportation services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant construction services to enron entities and third parties . the remainder of eecc will become part of ees . larry izzo will report to the ees office of the chairman . these changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth opportunities within enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our employees . please join us in supporting and implementing these changes .

2	Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst " kill clause " for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal " kill clause " adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a " kill clause " that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the " bush price caps plan " collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a " non - bypassable " charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .

2	Subject: from donald dear friend , my name is mr . donald lekota . i am an accountant with a bank here in london . there is a fixed deposit of £ 15 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( fifteen million pounds sterling ) made to this bank since 1994 which ten years now and since then no claim or withdrawal has been made on that deposit . fortunately , i have been the person working the interest from the day of deposit to date . the interesting part of it is that the fixed deposit belongs to a man in yugoslavia , this means that the account may have been abandoned by the surviving family members or that they are not even aware of the existence of the deposit . however , i just finished updating the interest of the deposit this january , and it has come up to £ 15 , 000 , 000 . 00 at 7 % interest rate per annum . it is this interest that i am interested in because i know very well that the family will care less on what happens to the interest if they want to redeem the deposit , they will be interested on the main money , that is if they are able to claim it at all because all the money lodged into different banks here in europe and united states are now been claimed . meanwhile , my plan is to withdraw just some amount from the accumulated interest , which will not even affect the main fixed deposit . i will give you the details of procedure and my full id when i receive your reply and indication of partnership . your reward and amount to withdraw will be our mutual agreement to avoid any misunderstanding . we have nothing to lose , we only have courage to do this . please reply me as soon as possible . yours sincerely , mr . donald lekota get tiscali broadband from £ 15 : 99 - to unsubscribe from this list : send the line " unsubscribe linux - kernel " in the body of a message to majordomo @ vger . kernel . org more majordomo info at http : / / vger . kernel . org / majordomo - info . html please read the faq at http : / / www . tux . org / lkml /

2	Subject: re : out of interest this is more than you ever wanted to know about catalytica ! if there is any point to regurgitating it , that point would be that this deal didn ' t make a dime for enron , ge got a " gift " ( as i would see it ) of $ 10 million from enron , and catalytica got off scot - free . the december 1999 dash summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions to " permit the following : ( 1 ) sale and repurchase of the spark spread option ; ( 2 ) funding xonon development in an amount equal to the proceeds of the option sale ; ( 3 ) funding the turbine prepayment at the pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds ; ( 4 ) obtaining the right of first refusal on the first five commercial 7 fas equipped with xonon ; and ( 5 ) purchase of the turbines on an off  balance sheet basis " enhancing the value of the equity investment in catalytica was mentioned as a strategic benefit and potential upside . turbine overpricing was not mentioned in the dash or the risk matrix . when dave added his comments to the may 2000 dash i understood that the $ 10 million cost was intended to be offset by $ 10 million in turbine credits . doing an allocation of the cost seemed logically to mean allocation of the credits once they were recognised . outside of the slim chance that something blew up , the allocated cost would be offset with a subsequently allocated credit , i . e . a wash . from an ena perspective the issue is moot . if the decision is to allocate a portion of the turbine overpricing to the merchant portfolio but none of the credits , that clearly was not accounted for in 1999 or 2000 and certainly was not provided for in the 2001 merchant asset management plan . -

sorry for that . your chronology seems correct . this thing makes my head hurt every time it is brought up ! i believe the obligation was incurred dec 1999 , but not properly recognized / accounted for until the may , 2000 dash . delainey ' s hand - written note was the end result of people dissecting the deals with the realization that the west power turbines were overpriced by the $ 9 . 9 mm and the catalytica equity account did not properly account for that in dec 1999 . the turbine contract refers to a credit of $ 9 . 9 mm but the gross turbine price was increased by twice that amount so that the net increase was $ 9 . 9 mm . ena agreed to it because piper wanted to help catalytica . despite much protest from dave parquet , i agreed with delainey and ray bowen that west power would be on the hook for $ 3 . 3 mm of the $ 9 . 9 mm because the project got some benefit from catalytica . delainey wanted the payment triggered on sale of pastoria because he did not want my group to recognize any income until the project closed . this was communicated to and acknowledged by accounting and i reminded them of it every month or two since mid - year . i understand pat called sheila tweed - i dont think she ( or anyone ) remembers the details , but she should be able to validate the point about turbine overpricing and the delainey fix in may , 2000 . regards , chris richard lydecker @ enron 03 / 22 / 2001 05 : 19 pm to : christopher f calger / pdx / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : out of interest chris , i couldn ' t agree more about the confusing history of the catalytica xtia and spark spread derivative transactions . my understanding is slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources . neither of us were present at the creation . i am familiar with dave delainey ' s hand - written note on the may 22 , 2000 dash . that dash authorised accelerating repurchase of the sso by three months . my view is that dave could allocate within ena at his discretion . i did not understand the rationale , however , since it was the december 14 , 1999 dash which established the obligation for enron to fund the $ 9 . 9 million . all the may 22 , 2000 dash did was unwind a financing arrangement three months early . it did not have anything to do with the incurrence of the obligation itself . the objective of the complex series of agreements was for enron to finance ge ' s development of the xonon technology and in return receive credits on turbine purchases either at pastoria or for other xonon - equiped turbines if pastoria were cancelled . original deal 1 . catalytica agreed to purchase a spark spread option ( sso ) from enron for $ 9 . 9 million payable in four instalments . these instalments exactly matched the funding obligation to ge under the xtia . 2 . catalytica actually paid enron $ 3 million which represented the first two instalments . 3 . west lb made $ 3 million milestone payments to ge . the enron / west lp arrangement was an off balance sheet financing deal . at the end of the day , enron was paying ge . 4 . by september 30 , 2000 enron was obligated to repurchase the sso from catalytica for the amount catalytica had paid enron or for turbine credits if pastoria were cancelled . may 2000 sso repurchase 1 . enron bought back the sso from catalytica for $ 3 million . the three - month acceleration of repurchase was supposed to facilitate an ipo . it did not impact at all enron ' s ultimate obligation which had always been for the full $ 9 . 9 million . catalytica was now out of the chain and had no further payment obligations or credit entitlements . december 2000 final milestone payment to ge 1 . enron has paid ge $ 9 . 9 million through the west lb financing arrangement ( now turbo park ) i am uncertain whether ge increased the price of the pastoria turbines by $ 9 . 9 million as part of these transactions . my understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated , but i had thought this concern was to be guarded against in contract negotiation with ge . if in fact ge did increase the cost of the pastoria turbines by $ 9 . 9 million the entire purpose and benefit to enron from these incredibly complex and non - intuitive documents was totally obviated . net , net enron would have paid ge to develop a technology application with no compensatory value . why enron would have done this kind of deal i don ' t know . i ' m not sure what internal income transfer would apply . i understand that ge has applied the $ 9 . 9 million credit against a progress payment billing late last year . wouldn ' t this mean that the full credit was taken by pastoria ? it is unclear to me why the sale of pastoria should trigger anything . at the end of the day ena did the deal in 1999 and how we account for the consequences now is irrelevant . if the turbines were overpriced , the december 14 , 1999 dash seems to me to be misleading in not disclosing that fact when approval was requested . the dash actually states that the $ 9 . 9 million would " serve as a down payment for the pastoria turbine package . " my summary may not be correct but this is the best i have been able to piece together on what happened . dick . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by richard lydecker / corp / enron on 03 / 22 / 2001 04 : 54 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - louise kitchen @ ect 03 / 22 / 2001 03 : 13 pm to : richard lydecker / corp / enron @ enron cc : subject : re : out of interest - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by louise kitchen / hou / ect on 03 / 22 / 2001 03 : 10 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - christopher f calger 03 / 22 / 2001 02 : 56 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : out of interest calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for pastoria was overpriced by $ 9 . 9 mm , the amount of the catalytica credit . a brief confusing history as i understand it . . . ena east and west jointly owned the catalytica equity account in 1999 . it was written up based on expectations of an ipo value . at 12 / 99 it transferred to west power because catalytica entered into an agreement with pastoria to provide the project with its zonon technology . this agreement included a commitment from ge to do research / work in order to use the catalytica technology on ge turbines . the cost of this ( $ 9 . 9 mm ) was added to the pastoria turbine contract . in feb 2000 , when i arrived in portland , i had the catalytica account transferred to the portfolio because i thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ena west power . in mid - 2000 the agreement was restructured in order to " clean up " catalytica so it could ipo . at that time , enron was credited back the $ 9 . 9 mm from catalytica and it was decided by delainey that that amount should be split 2 / 3 - pastoria and 1 / 3 catalytica equity , with the 2 / 3 going to ena west power upon the sale of pastoria . pastoria did not get the full $ 9 . 9 mm back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings . at this time , since there is no funds transfer , i believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the merchant portfolio to ena west power . louise kitchen 03 / 22 / 2001 08 : 33 am to : christopher f calger / pdx / ect @ ect cc : subject : out of interest what happens under the pastoria deal to the catalytica credit - did it go to calpine or are you using it in the other turbine purchases ?

2	Subject: california on the brink - - cera alert cera alert : december 13 , 2000 title : california on the brink cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible . western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis , regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market . the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws . in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem . rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed , several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a challenging siting and permitting process . medicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of california ' s electric market woes . * * challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities . * price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state . * repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development . * calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development . * facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust . cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors . california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state . despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 . in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage . the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall : * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ? * stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build . * move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence ( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments . * encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response . * encourage market mechanisms that dampen the " boom bust " characteristic of the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement , or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate ) future price volatility . * avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its course . * allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions . * free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power . * * end * * this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours . this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

2	Subject: california update 2 / 20 / 01 bankruptcy today , california energy operating corporation sued southern california edison seeking payment for november and december power sales , totalling $ 45 m . this move is likely a sign of things to come . it shows that generators do not believe that there will be a viable solution from the governor . calenergy is positioning themselves as a primary creditor . past experience dictates that lawsuits are often used as a means of communication in bankruptcy situations . in the case of a judgement in calenergy ' s favor , calenergy would be able to seize edison ' s bank assets assuming there is no bankruptcy in the meantime . it is another strategy for getting paid without actually filing an involuntary bankruptcy . however , if there are enough of these suits or if edison ignores a judgement in calenergy ' s favor , it will very likely be enough to trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing , followed closely by a voluntary filing . the generators are stating that they will not subscribe to any deal until their past bills are paid . there currently is no arrangement to pay the generators for power they are supplying to the iso . thus , the generators are beginning to see the utilities and the state as one and the same . the governor is reportedly trying to come up with a plan that will result in the lowest possible rate increase in order to minimize the public ' s reaction . the governor has stated that he will put a plan in place in accordance with the " existing rate structure . " according to rosenfield , he is considering a 19 % rate increase . this number was arrived at by combining the 9 % temporary , emergency increase passed by the puc and a 10 % rate reduction imposed by the legislature under bill ab 1890 that is scheduled to expire next month . this increase would be put in place for as long as necessary to pay back the utilities ' debt . this plan contrasts enacting a 30 % or 40 % rate increase over a period of a few years . a lower increase over a longer period of time , coupled with the financing charges over that same period , is likely to have a detrimental effect on the california economy in comparison to its neighbors . consumer advocacy group the consumer groups continue to insist that the generators give something up as part of any deal . according to a source close to harvey rosenfield , head of a leading consumer advocacy group in california , rosenfield feels the longer it takes the governor to flesh out a deal with the utilities , the lower the price offered for the transmission assets will be . this is due to public pressure on elected officials not to enter into a bailout agreement ; the pressure will only increase as time passes

2	Subject: ferc ' s 4 / 26 / 01 order on california price mitigation if you read ray alvarez ' s summary from yesterday evening , open the attached word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order , which was issued this afternoon . alan comnes the full order is available at : http : / / www . ferc . fed . us / electric / bulkpower . htm summary of ferc ' s order establishing prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for the california wholesale electric markets and establishing an investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets ( issued april 26 , 2001 ) effective date - - price mitigation is effective may 29 , 2001 . ( iso needs to have its day - ahead proxy price ready on 5 / 28 ) physical withholding - - to prevent physical withholding , the plan will require sellers with pga ' s to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade . all california generators , even those not subject to ferc price regulation , will be required to sell into the iso ' s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso ' s interstate transmission lines . hydroelectric facilities will be exempted . ( this requirement to provide power is for all hours ( 24 / 7 ) for lyr ) price mitigation - the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market . during stage 1 , 2 and 3 emergencies in the iso ' s real time market , each generator ( other than hydro ) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator ' s heat curve , emission rates , gas costs and emission costs , plus $ 2 / mwh for o emissions are to be based on cantor fitzgerald environmental brokerage services . the iso will publish by 8 : 00 am , the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared . these figures ( for the next day ) will be based on the prior day ' s gas daily and cantor fitzgerald data . a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators . highest bid sets the clearing price . each gas - fired generator must file with ferc and the iso within 5 days , on a confidential basis , heat and emission rates for each generating unit . the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator , including maintenance and operating costs . generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability . ( although the following qualification is made : " however , all public utility rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market - based rates , discussed infra . " presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior . ) in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price , the generator must , within 7 days of the end of each month , file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price . ferc explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the " all delivery point " index it has adopted . ferc has 60 days to review / act . no opportunity costs in real time . marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost . underscheduling penalites - - ferc acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place . thus , although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in r / t at capped prices , doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective $ 100 / mwh penalty . see p . 20 of the ferc order . new generation - - new generation is not exempted from the commission ' s price mitigation measures . demand response - - beginning june 1 , only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids . ferc is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive . ( this requirement is in effect for all hours ( 24 / 7 ) ) outages - - pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages the iso is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages , including periodic reports to the commission . term - order expires one year from date of issuance . rto filing - california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 or order lapses with no further effect . the rto filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in order no . 2000 . iso reporting - on september 14 , 2001 , iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built . comments are due in 15 days . quarterly reports thereafter . revocation of market based rate authority and refunds - the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on ( 1 ) no physical withhold of capacity , and ( 2 ) no inappropriate bidding behavior . inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior . an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate . in addition , " hockey stick " bids are expressly prohibited ( i . e . bidding 95 % at marginal cost and 5 % at a much higher level ) . other prohibited bidding practices identified include : pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs . west - wide section 206 investigation - opens a section 206 investigation concerning the j & r of wholesale power in the wscc other than sales to the caiso market . ferc requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation . however its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time ( markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of r / t ) spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7 % within a control area . ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california . comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations . although it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non - california pnw , the ferc sets the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the order . nox limits in california - - must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law . however , it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement - just include the fines as part of the price bid . also if nox is limited , may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price . surcharge to pay past amount due - - comments are due in 30 days on ( 1 ) whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and ( 2 ) the effect this surcharge would have on the pg & e bankruptcy filing . treatment of the caiso ' s market stabilization plan ( msp ) . the ferc rejects the caiso ' s msp saying that ferc ' s plan for market mitigation is sufficient . it expressly rejects caiso ' s plan to create a day - ahead and hour - ahead energy markets are expressly reject and tells caiso to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets . unfortunately , it does not expressly reject caiso ' s plan to cut exports . in general , no mention was made as to issue of exports of power from california although the statement that caiso must become a real rto would support the notion that caiso must honor firm schedules on its system . . recap of dates identified in the order ? issue date : 4 / 26 / 01 ? heat rate emission filing from generators due : 5 days ( 5 / 1 / 01 ) ? comments due on wscc - wide price mitigation : 10 days ( 5 / 6 / 01 ) ? iso tariff filing due : 15 days ( 5 / 11 / 01 ) ? comments on iso tariff due : 5 days thereafter ( 5 / 16 / 01 ) ? comments on whether commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid generator bills : 5 / 30 / 01 ? effective date of proxy prices : 5 / 29 / 01 ? demand responsive bids from load serving entities : 6 / 1 / 01 ? refund effective date begins : 60 days after publishing in federal register ( late june ? ) ? first iso quarterly report : 9 / 14 / 01 ? comments on first iso quarterly report : 15 days thereafter ( 9 / 29 / 01 ) ? plan terminates : 4 / 26 / 02 ra & gac

" the market is really shrugging off this news , " said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front " looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , " mr . kroll said . " i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . " although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . " the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , " said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be " difficult . " companies " are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , " said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as " double witching .

( ene ) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company ' s bonds monday . on sunday , the independent in london reported that royal dutch petroleum co . ( rd ) planned to mount an $ 11 billion offering for the company . and barron ' s stated that there was speculation that enron might attract takeover interest from either royal dutch or warren buffet ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka ) . enron ' s bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to treasury bond issues . a $ 74 bid and a $ 77 offer was quoted as the market for enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % bonds of 2003 monday morning , similar to friday ' s levels . " the company ' s bonds were quoted in the low - to mid - 70 s on friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing , " said wayne schmidt , portfolio manager , advantus capital management , st . paul , minn . " market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds , " said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . even an enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par , traders said . the 6 . 45 % coupon bond due on november 15 , 2001 , less than two weeks away , was bid at a dollar price of 99 . " some investors don ' t want to own anything with a downside risk , " said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin & co . , a distressed debt brokerage firm , princeton , n . j . the bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame , with little upside potential gain , he added . there is " very little liquidity in the company ' s bonds , " said rivkin . enron ' s bonds will follow the company ' s stock movements , he added . enron closed monday at $ 11 . 03 , down $ 0 . 27 from friday ' s close of $ 11 . 30 . enron officials weren ' t immediately available to comment . crisis of investor confidence the houston - based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month . and last wednesday , the company said that the securities and exchange commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the ratings agencies have reacted to the company ' s liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence . fitch downgraded enron ' s senior unsecured debt monday to triple - b - minus , from triple - b - plus . it ' s now just a notch away from junk bond status . last week , standard & poor ' s corp . lowered the credit rating to triple - b , while moody ' s investors service lowered the rating to baa 2 . shell may have interest , but royal dutch shell may have an interest in enron , say analysts . " shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to expand in north america and latin america , " said tina vital , equity analyst , standard 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . market views enron takeover rumors with skepticism by christina cheddar of dow jones newswires 11 / 05 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - with each day shedding light on new revelations about enron corp . ' s ( ene ) financial dealings , it is difficult to put odds on the company as a takeover target . but speculation has been persistent that royal dutch / shell group may use enron ' s weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover . over the weekend , the british newspaper , the independent , fanned the flames of speculation again by saying that shell was expected to offer $ 11 billion for the houston energy trader . a shell spokesman wasn ' t immediately available . surely , enron ' s thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a company such as the anglo - dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the u . s . natural gas market , where shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence . however , a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company ' s financial structure . enroll has used a web of off - balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs . some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off its balance sheet . several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such as shell would want to make an acquisition while a securities and exchange commission investigation is pending . as for enron ' s core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is enron ' s staff . as a result , it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile transactions . shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing and trading sector through its coral energy unit , and the acquisition of enron could give it instant clout in the market . also , shell ' s strong balance sheet would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness . traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it would be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation calmed and more details of enron ' s business are uncovered . a growth - fund manager , who requested anonymity , also said it is important to know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in enron ' s stock price . he speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock . enron shares recently traded at $ 11 . 14 , down 16 cents , or 1 . 4 % . the stock began the day in positive territory , and traded as high as $ 12 . 20 intraday . the stock has declined more than 60 % since the company in mid - october posted a third - quarter charge of more than $ 1 billion . the company also later disclosed an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andy fastow . in the weeks that followed the disclosure , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded by moody ' s investor service , standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones they are very smart and very wise to the ways of wall street , main street and the oil patch . norman blake is a gent i met years ago at usfg , before he sold it at a huge profit . this man has recently served as ceo of comdisco , a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing , it is wallowing in it . blake has general electric training . this man can smell things that are not so right from miles away . where was he in all of this ? stuck in comdisco hell ? ronnie chan is a longtime kingpin in hong kong , a place where financial originality is always on display . chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared . he ' s seen everything over in kong . john duncan is an energy investment guy , a director of eott energy , and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting . again , very sophisticated . wendy gramm regulated derivatives . she was the chairman of the cftc and a director of the chicago mercantile exchange . how could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed ? that was part of her old job . robert jaedicke was a professor of accounting at stanford business school , where he was also dean . this guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming . ( i am skipping ken lay , the ceo . ) charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn , two execs from the university of texas m . d . anderson cancer center , can ' t be expected to catch this stuff , and therefore gets a pass from me . paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro . that ' s probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations . how could he not raise a word about it ? frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international , perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management . i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enron ' s looking through his own company ' s portfolio of investments . jeffrey skilling , the man who resigned as ceo , needs to be heard from . we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas , a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don ' t get hold . what did he know and when did he know it ? john wakeham , lord wakeham to everybody , is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament . he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant . he ' s big and powerful and smart . herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central , a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations . in short , this is the most sophisticated , hands - on group of folks i have come across . i can ' t believe they checked off on this stuff . i have to believe they didn ' t know , or if they knew of the partnerships , i believe they had no idea what they were doing . i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enron ' s credit rating with the agencies - - not that that ' s such an ethical setup . but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant , as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were . still , let ' s not fool ourselves . this was a powerhouse , fantastic , upright board of people who know a thing or two . i can ' t believe they let this stuff occur . i think they knew nothing . which is pretty terrible in its own right . this market deserves your well - placed optimism by james j . cramer > realmoney . com 11 / 05 / 2001 10 : 32 am est url : > d ? j ? vu circa 1991 . that ' s what i keep thinking about . i recall that time vividly . bank of boston , chase , chemical , citibank , they all started rallying . we bears would call each other and joke about it . we would say that it was a ridiculous move , that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively , because there was no way that any of these banks would make it . heck , bank of boston was teetering on insolvency . citibank was technically bankrupt already . the jim grants of the world ( more powerful now than they were then because he didn ' t have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt ) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying . i would call the analysts , and they wouldn ' t know anything either - - the ones who liked the banks all the way down , who still liked them and who had no credibility at all . the ones who hated them didn ' t want to get off the winning horses . they didn ' t know that the race was over and that a new one had begun . or , to put it the brutal way that i now know was right : no one with a brain was long any of these . turns out , of course , that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom . what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism , because at certain points in history optimists get it right . that ' s how i feel about this market . i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred . i think we will look back at this period and say the following : the great bear market started in march 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until sept . 11 , the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around . most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come . they were wrong , just like they were in 1991 . we get so caught up in the " is cisco bottoming ? " or " is intel breaking out ? " minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now , pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago . you would think that we ' d have converted more bears to bulls by now , but like in 1991 , it didn ' t happen until well into the turn . don ' t confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities . i think that , for example , xo communications is going to fail , and when it does , there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech . i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same . there are a ton of companies that won ' t get through this period , just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991 . and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks . i can ' t get my arms around how ford comes back ; i don ' t understand the enron fiasco at all . i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding . but that doesn ' t make me bearish . understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature . had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991 , had i not personally been " bought in " on a half - dozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from super - regionals not long after i , too , would be suspicious and want to bet against the market . i can ' t , though , because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i don ' t want to get burned by again . believe me , i am a cold - blooded individual about these things . if i thought the short side was the right side here , i would be all over it . we have had a huge bounce off the bottom ; there would be nothing " unpatriotic " about saying " get out now . " but i don ' t think that ' s right . i think this market ' s going to keep working here . if it doesn ' t , people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me , and i will say , c ' est la vie , i took a stand ; it was wrong . taking stands , however , is what it is all about . knowing your context and making money with that context is what i do and have done for 20 years . if you don ' t have a context , if you don ' t have a view , there ' s only one thing to do : give your money to others who do . random musings : glenn curtis ' s era of value newsletter has been making me money . when something makes me money i talk about it . check it out here . curtis and gary b . smith both are doing some terrific things . understand , i get all of the newsletters out there . i see the hype that a navallier or a murphy puts out and i want to puke . this stuff is nothing like that , nothing at all . it is honest , candid and doesn ' t guarantee that you will shoot the lights out , like those who you know can ' t . . . on my radio show , it ' s mutual fund monday , where we will fix your 401 ( k ) ) . call me at 1 - 800 - 862 - 8686 from 3 p . m . to 4 p . m . et .

waste and energy geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . geec generates 5 to 10 mega -

2	Subject: [ ilug - social ] urgent assistant needed dear friend , i am mrs . sese - seko widow of late president mobutu sese - seko of zaire , now known as democratic republic of congo ( drc ) . i am moved to write you this letter . this was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation . i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons james kongolo and nzanga out of democratic republic of congo ( drc ) to abidjan , coted ' ivoire where my family and i settled , while we later moved to settled in morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease . however , due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband ' s billions of dollars deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of ( dr ) mr laurent kabila has made arrangement with the swiss government and other european countries to freeze all my late husband ' s treasures deposited in some european countries . hence , my children and i decided laying low in africa to study the situation till when things gets better . like now that president kabila is dead and the son taking over ( joseph kabila ) . one of my late husband ' s chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the french government , and as such i had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated . i have deposited the sum eighteen million united state dollars ( us $ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 . ) with a security company for safe keeping . what i want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf , so that i can introduce you to my son ( kongolo ) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds . i want you to assist in investing this money , but i will not want my identity revealed . i will also want to acquire real / landed properties and stock in multi - national companies and to engage in other safe and non - speculative investments as adviseby your good self . may i at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality , which this upcoming project demands , and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence , which i repose in you . in conclusion , if you want to assist us , my son ( kongolo ) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project , tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services . for this reason kindly furnish us your contact information , that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address . yours sincerely , mrs . mariam m . seseseko . - - irish linux users ' group social events : social @ linux . ie http : / / www . linux . ie / mailman / listinfo / social for ( un ) subscription information . list maintainer : listmaster @ linux . ie 
2	Subject: off - site travel question the e - mail that was sent out many weeks ago about the off - site indicated that it would run from wednesday night to saturday am . it is now running thursday until sunday . calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $ 13 k for one roundtrip and a total of $ 20 k for two round trips . i had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in oregon on saturday night . it is a good friend of mine and my wife ' s . it ' s in eastern oregon and is about a four hour drive away . i see the following choices before me : 1 . don ' t go to colorado . tell you guys that i ' m a family man and not a company man . 2 . go to colorado and fly home commercial on friday night , leaving at about 4 pm . incremental cost of flight would be $ 500 . 3 . go to colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early saturday afternoon . incremental cost of flight would be $ 7 , 000 . 4 . don ' t go to wedding . tell my wife that i ' m a company man and that it is critical that i ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30 - something enron folks all weekend . while i have authority to place millions of dollars of the company ' s money at risk , i don ' t feel comfortable signing up for a $ 7 , 000 extra flight without talking to you guys . # 3 , the jet set answer costs quite a bit more , but it dramatically increases the amount of time that i spend in colorado . # 2 is cost - effective but gives me less than 24 hours in colorado . # 4 , while perhaps appealing to you , doesn ' t work for me . # 2 is probably preferable to # 1 , just requires a lot of travel time to me . any thoughts would be greatly appreciated .

2	Subject: california update # 2 , 2 / 23 / 01 1 . bankruptcy an increasingly attractive option for davis despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching normal levels after a month of torrential storms , back at the poker table in sacramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy . indeed , almost any reading of governor gray davis ' s political situation after the shock la federal court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his best bet . at least one of the three major power generators ( pg & e ) seems to agree that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now , particularly after yesterday ' s ferc ruling that it is okay for the company to shift assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy . 2 . davis wants to keep hope alive until analyst meetings next week today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the national governor ' s association and meet with wall street analysts tuesday and wednesday . in fact , davis ' s desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in california . according to talks with all sides , davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers ( pg & e , socal edison and san diego ) for something like $ 7 billion that they could use to pay off most of the money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate shells . but the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wondering whether davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situation where he has court - ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he knows are necessary , but politically difficult . according to key sacramento officials , " confidence continues to wane in davis ' ability to do this . the plain fact is the stick he ' s carrying isn ' t awfully big . " adds another : " the key people here just think the utilities are playing him . either they ' re playing him , or he ' s going to roll on the price , he ' s going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth . the utilities got away with the same kind of thing before , in 1996 of course . " davis is more astute than that , and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in los angeles . 3 . little support for transmission assets deal the transmission assets deal doesn ' t look attractive for anyone . davis has no particular affinity for it , having adopted state senator burton ' s proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade . the legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry , and concerned about the vast investment needed in the network . the utilities - - pg state offers only tepid support for bond scheme " there are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility accounting methods which the audits didn ' t pick up " says one california official . " the way they calculate depreciation is very strange . if the accounts were done on a proper gaap basis instead of some kind of ferc basis they would look different . " even if the deal goes through , the financing could be difficult and very expensive . the state has definitively ruled out putting the full faith and credit of the state of california behind the proposed bonds . state treasurer angelides has also been informed it is unlikely they ' d qualify for tax - exempt status . 5 . small ipp players furious and while the big players talk , there is increasing nervousness among small independent and alternative generators . the small companies have been the biggest losers so far - - their representative , jan smutny - jones , was tossed off the board of the california iso , and the closing of the california px deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power . the ceos of large companies like dynegy and reliant are talking to davis on a daily basis , but the small companies are out of the loop . they also lack the financial resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long . large companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential political and relationship risks across the us if they get cast in the role of villain in california . for the small companies , however , it is a matter of survival . some legislators in sacramento are operating under the assumption that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to force bankruptcy . not so . all it takes is three creditors owed at least $ 11 , 000 each to apply for bankruptcy . two small companies , cal energy and ridgewood power , are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment . if bankruptcy is triggered , there is immense uncertainty about what would happen . no major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome , especially after the shock of judge lew ' s unexpected ruling in los angeles . it is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the state supreme court . ferc and the federal government could also be ensnared as writs fly . but to many of the players , that uncertain mess following bankruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal .

2	Subject: continuing testing of preschedule workspace , path confirmation and path cut software i am working in the target date of june 20 th . today i added schedules from palo verde and the entire midc sheet to the testing group . once cob is added , we will have pretty much an average daily volume . here is my attached worksheet for mid c in preschedule workspace : i added palo verde to the group of deals imported , and ran a total of 37 lines into the path confirmation . the rest of the sheet was all bookouts , and so i marked them for routing only . i do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation . this will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for real time and settlements . i would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up , as the lists can be long , and i have to make notes on what is wrong . also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time . we currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths . this would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet , instead of cleaning up afterwards . routing functionality question : if we change a delivery point in scheduling ( bpa nw delivered gets moved and changed every day ) , do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point ? these types of deals route now , i would like to duplicate that existing functionality . i did get an error message on those lines , " capability not supported : deal has multiple delivery points " please see the attached sheet , there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86 , but it is all deals that are our bpa northwest delivered . the routing speed is excellent . one second per line or less all the way in portland on local enpower ! the megawatts also appear to split properly between mis - matched deal amounts ! this is very encouraging . my palo data was corrupted , so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points . my plan is to attack the alias stuff from a different angle . we are going to work with the team that sets the enpower " short name " to something that is workable . i would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that enpower short name . in path confirmation the early sorting looks good , things look very versatile and useable . yesterday i identified several problems : 1 . the entire path needs to be shown in both counterparty paths . currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp . 2 . the alias list is not functioning properly . the enpower long name needs to be shown in the collapsed counterparty view , along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp . 3 . confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch , not pulling up each deal line by line . today , i am finding the following : 1 . when a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view , the system blows away the schedule term and the delivery point . these fields have to be re - populated before saving can occur . 2 . i am not allowed to sort by global id , even though global ids are populated there . my idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section , no globals go in another section , and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers . ( just like the phys vs . non phys ) . 3 . pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes . this is to long to be practical in production for real time . i would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less . 4 . all paths are showing up as being cut ( cut checkbox checked ) , even though none have been cut yet . 5 . the grey on grey color scheme is not going to work , but that is a little thing . lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable . variations of the beige color are easier to read . 6 . the path cut button and dialog boxes i think are going to need alot of work . it looks like i will have to do all the enpower work first , and then populate the cut . this is a bit different than we discussed . my plan is to take this as far as i can , and then hand it over to bill williams iii and his group for final ' tweaking ' . 7 . i also cannot sort by tag number . we need that . thank you all for your work on this , it is really looking good . i have to schedule on monday , but will jump right back in when i am finished with daily tasks . cara

2	Subject: re : replacement cost values jim , lets get together to discuss - if we need to pull someone else into the discussion , then lets do it . the current structure for allocating insurance costs does not provide the correct price signals to the business units as to the real cost of holding assets . this year we have been asked to increase our velocity of capital , cash flow , and our return on equity . corporate charges need to provide the correct incentives to accomplish this . i suggest that you use the " cost of capital charge " as a model to allocate cost that can be re - assessed and re - allocated at least at mid - year . given that this year is waning , i suggest that you absorb " freed up " insurance capacity at the corp level . i imagine that if a business unit purchased an asset mid - year it would bear an allocation of insurance cost , so why not provide a savings when an asset is sold ? i will call to set up a time we can meet . regards , brian p . s . i ' m not sure i understand what you mean by " once you complete your study of replacement cost values " - as nothing is being replaced ?

2	Subject: gas prices vince - 1 . we can detect " hoarding " of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against the actual inflow . 2 . we can detect " market power " by dissociating the seller from the buyer , distinguishing between the physical " cost " in gas to run the generators and the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis . 3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect " storage " as the difference between inflow and consumption . it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors : hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can " calibrate " the price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding , from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally , flows are " explained " by the model , and can be imputed from prices if necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of the weather . i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a model . clayton

" however , the feeling at enron is quite different this year because of the depressed stock price , california , india , broadband , etc . i ' d welcome your thoughts on what the tone for the conference should be , i . e . subdued optimism , reenergizing , etc . on a related subject , ken lay and jeff skilling will both have an hour on the agenda to speak . this is in response to feedback from employees saying they want to hear more from each of them . afterall , they are both top notch industry speakers . rather than have them give a current " state of the company " address , i intend to have them focus on bigger company , industry or market topics . i ' d love your thoughts on this as well . ( i believe jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision , and as an economist , ken could give valuable insight into what ' s happening in the market . ) finally , i ' d welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker . i ' d very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1 . ) enron people admire ; and 2 . ) has undergone some difficult period in their company ' s history . jeff personally extended an invitation to steve ballmer from microsoft , but he is unable to attend . is there someone you think would be interesting ? i truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue . i look forward to your thoughts and ideas . terrie james senior director , public relations enron broadband services ( ph ) 713 . 853 . 7727 ( fax ) 713 . 646 . 3248 terrie . james @ enron . com

2	Subject: important update on california legislation - - 08 . 23 . 01 received the following additional information late yesterday from speaker hertzberg ' s chief of staff regarding direct access in the legislation working its way through the assembly . he relayed the information during an informational hearing that an assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in sacramento . see previous note attached below for more a detailed description of da provisions in the bill : a new print of the bill is likely to be issued today . with respect to da , the governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of da in the bill . assembly ds and other market participants lobbied him hard , explaining that , since the bill covers all costs of bonds and dwr contracts through " exit fees , " there is no reason to suspend da . the governor is resisting hard , stating that " he wants time for the market to stabilize . " so it looks like the governor ' s plan is to 1 ) have a bill that provides for direct access as of 1 . 1 . 03 and 2 ) have the puc " temporarily suspend " da from september 1 to 1 . 1 . 03 . we ' re continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate , or significantly shorten , the suspension . the bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by august 23 , 2001 ( yesterday ) will not be responsible for any dwr going forward contracts . the customer will have to pay for any power consumed that dwr purchased on the ious ' behalf between jan 17 and the date of the switch . the bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and sept 1 be responsible for dwr going forward contracts ( though details of how that would work were not clear ) . the stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the august 23 rd date is to prevent a " rush " to direct access between now and sept 1 . there are currently no efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to sept 1 . finally , the bill apparently will also give self - generation priority over direct access in each " open season . " the bill would set aside 250 mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen . if the self gen is not subscribed , the mws would go to da . the bill , including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues , is supposed to be released today . the bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoon . we continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisions . it remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly . the politicians are very reluctant to pass any " edison bail out bill " and the political pressure not to vote on any " bailout " is significant and growing . but the governor is working the bill very hard . mirant is actively working against the bill . mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a " bailout " could lose re - election . mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes . the bill also has to make it through the senate . our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president , john burton , who said flatly that " he ' s not doing anything . " but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session , and the possibility of burton doing a deal is 50 - 50 . with respect to the bill ' s provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the " dedicated rate component " included , edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers . edison also said that , under the assembly version of the bill , edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds . more info to follow as it becomes available . if anyone has any questions , don ' t hesitate to contact me . best , jeff - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dasovich , jeff sent : wednesday , august 22 , 2001 8 : 08 pm to : [ dasovich , jeff ] subject : latest legislative version of direct access - - 08 . 22 . 01 the following is a summary of the direct access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that davis cut with assembly . things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly . i was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the davis ' and hertzberg ' s staff and the staff have agreed to amend the da provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers . they also said that favorable provisions with respect to self - gen would also be added to the bill . they said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow . note : in addition to the da provisions , the bill also includes provisions that 1 ) explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edison ' s undercollection , and 2 ) permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit . ( the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers , however , and leaves that portion of edison ' s debt for edison ' s management and shareholders to address . ) summary of direct access provisions : the program would begin january 1 , 2003 . it ' s unclear what would happen to da between now and january 1 , 2003 . presumably , the decision to suspend , or not , between now and then would stay with the california puc . 90 days after the effective date of the bill , and every 6 months thereafter , dwr would provide information to the puc showing the net short position . every 6 months , the puc would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to da . 20 kw - and - above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the puc has announced the open season ; under 20 kw customers would have 180 days . customers who switch to da would be responsible for paying 1 ) the customer ' s proportionate share of the utility ' s undercollection and 2 ) the customer ' s proportionate share of dwr ' s receivables ( if any ) for power previously delivered by dwr ( but not yet fully paid for by customers ) . in addition , if the number of customers who elect to choose to go da in the open season exceeds the net short , then da customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any dwr stranded contract costs . if the number of da customers does not exceed the net short position , then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed . best , jeff
