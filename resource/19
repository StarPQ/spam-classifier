2	Subject: new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products . this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . summary of new features multiple children - a " child " product can be the " parent " of another child ( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed against a single parent . static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and hit the " + " or " - " button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout . sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your " shift " key . parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : " basis link - parent " and now would say " stand alone , parent " ) . detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a customer attempts a transaction , the database must " lock " each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks . " vertical " chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are much slower to process than " flat " chains ( one parent with many children ) . large vertical chains should be avoided . related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link . static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for " sticky " product bar price and volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the " + " or " - " buttons . one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate . you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . sorting / selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in alphabetical order ) . if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort criteria , plus you can select " sort by web order " , which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another . parent products and f / x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product . some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now identified with a stylised " fx " in the product list . this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent , rather than managed individually . assistance as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 ) 20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) . general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .

( 7 , 265 mws ) the ferc has investigated these outages and found no improprieties - just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities . 2 . there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1 , 244 mws of projected supply from rerating / restarting existing thermal and renewable projects . it is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer , if at all . as evidenced by the e - mail i sent out this morning , local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units . in addition , these units are likely to be uneconomical . 3 . in the existing resource pool , there are roughly 1 , 430 mws of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations . the governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions , we are beginning to seem some movement ; however , the us epa has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards . 4 . the distributed generation / back - up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown . while there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back - up generation at " essential public services " the increase in dg is expected from " clean " sources , not diesel emergency generators . 5 . the cec is doing everything it can to get 50 + mw peaking units on - line by this summer . they are promising a 21 - day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets , for " clean " sources of generation in critical areas . please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information . cec ' s summer forecasted peak demand - resource balance : list of peakers running into their operating hour limitations : also available in hard copy format only : ( please e - mail me your fax number if you ' d like a copy ) table 1 : fully executed ca iso summer reliability agreements ( the iso peaking facilities ) table 2 : summer 2001 supply options - renewables construction status summary table 3 : summer 2001 supply options - rerate of non - cec projects table 4 : summer 2001 supply options - cec rerate status summary table 5 : idle biomass plants potentially capable of restart mary schoen environmental strategies enron corp 713 - 345 - 7422

2	Subject: path confirmation testing of latest release good afternoon : i am looking at version 1 . 0 . 0 . 47 the day i was checking was initally june 23 , but switched over to june 20 th ( new data ) text wrapping : the text wraps in the following fields : counterparty tag comments the text does not consistently wrap in the path field , which is the most critical field to have wrap . missing transmission information : ( june 20 th re - ran to check this ) the transmission information from transl , transloasis seems to be coming thru ( inconsistently ) ; and i still do not see the transmission information from trans 2 , trans 2 oasis represented . i re - ran my data from the 20 th to check it but when . i went to delete my data for the 20 th , and there was none there . do you all know if this data was purposefully removed , or did it just go away ? the only data that seems to have survived to this version is the data from 6 / 23 . sorting : by tag - i see how to make it sort in the strip , but cannot just look at tag numbers . right now in lotus , if i activate the sort by tag i get a list , and if i just start typing a tag number , it takes me to the one i want . can we have that capability duplicated ? by global id - this needs to be able to be done in the upper sort area . expanded view : will the path size in the expanded view be fixed in the next release ? i still cannot see the whole path . the delivery point is blank when i pull this up , but i populated border 1 and 2 . what drives this ? path cut : ( working in june 20 th data ) i was able to sucessfully cut a path - but with the following problems 1 . region still needs to be the forced choice that i mentioned in earlier e - mails 2 . after a path is cut , and i go into the original path , i can ' t see any way to easily find the cut associated with the path . maybe a - go to cut - button 3 . i would like to be able to add incremental hours to a cut , as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time . a new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut . question : in the expanded view of the path under counterparty ; i see a name of a person kind of greyed out . who is this person ? it does not match the trader name on the deal . i looked at williams deal # 633037 . 1 . janelle barsness shows in the path expanded view , but no trader is visible in the trade ( done on eol ) . i looked at wapa deal # 622350 . 1 , kathy crane is in the path expanded view , and penny casey is their trader . that ' s all for now , catch you all on monday cara

" simply stated , we have two problems : supply is too low and costs are too high . both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996 . but no matter how we got into this mess , you hired me to solve problems . and that ' s what i ' m doing . " the only long - term solution is to build more power plants . we must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities . but prices won ' t fall and supply won ' t be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume . " yet in the 12 years before i took office , not a single major power plant was built in california . not one . since i became governor , we ' ve licensed 12 major power plants . ten more are in the pipeline . and we ' re doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water . " deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies . the generators are free to charge whatever they want because they ' re governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices . " this past winter , the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof , driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy . " in january , with the feds still refusing to do their job , california stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy . we didn ' t take over to save the utilities . we took over to keep the power on and the economy strong . that ' s not all : - - we also negotiated long - term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices . - - i used my emergency powers to seize control of low - cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators . - - we began negotiations to buy the utilities ' transmission system . - - we cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants . - - we ' re launching an $ 800 million conservation program . - - we ' re moving to establish a public power authority to build more power . if the private sector fails to build all the plants california needs , we ' ll build them ourselves . - - and because i share your concern that the generators are ripping us off , we ' re using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct . " we can ' t fix 12 years of inaction overnight . but we ' re making real progress . " now , as you know , i have fought tooth and nail against raising rates . it ' s become increasingly clear , however , that with rising natural gas prices , the feds ' failure to control costs , and the state ' s lack of supply , that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong . " but i remain committed to protecting average californians from massive rate hikes . so i ' m urging the public utilities commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers , reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back . " under my proposal , more than half of you won ' t pay a penny more . for the rest , the average increase will be 26 1 / 2 percent . for many of that group , rates will rise only about 10 percent . the heaviest users will see their rates rise 34 1 / 2 percent on average . that includes business paying their share . this is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we ' ve all been paying since last winter . " but all californians can reduce their bills through conservation . " here ' s the point : the more you use , the more you pay . the more you conserve , the more you save . conservation is our best short - term weapon against blackouts and price - gouging . by flexing your power , you ' ll help secure our energy future . " unlike the puc , my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability - - if they agree to three main conditions : " they must provide low - cost regulated power to the state for 10 years . agree to sell us their transmission system . and dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates . " my proposal raises rates fairly , assures us of long - term power , stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation . " our emphasis on conservation is critical . in order to make it through the summer , we must cut demand by at least 10 percent . " already we ' ve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting , and reduce consumption in office buildings , schools and government facilities . " friends , we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless . we are 34 million strong and if each of us does our part , we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer . we are californians . we ' ve withstood earthquakes , floods , fires , and droughts . " yes , this mess is man - made , but with your help and god ' s blessing , we ' ll get through this as well . " thank you and good night . " copyright 2001 ap

2	Subject: alliance info alert dear generation / power marketing executive : the following is this week ' s alliance express newsletter , and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) . fasb 133 fasb is considering an exception to statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no . 133 that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives . a vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility , and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers . ( attached is a summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if you , or company cfo would like more information about this effort , please contact richard mcmahon , executive director of the alliance of energy suppliers , at rmcmahon @ eei . org , or at 202 - 508 - 5571 . alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25 , 2001 inside washington federal affairs * * * bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee * * * the senate banking committee today approved s 206 , a bill that repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 . the bill would repeal puhca and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and appropriate state agencies . s . 206 was approved with two amendments . offered by sen . mike enzi ( r - wy ) , the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy . another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets . * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * * the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association ( appa ) and the large public power council ( lppc ) again has been introduced in the house . the bill ( hr 1459 ) contains the same provisions as were in a measure ( hr 4971 ) , with technical corrections , introduced during the 106 th congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee . hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking , 3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities . the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees , probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal . administration / ferc * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * * president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6 trillion surplus over the next ten years . in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts . it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs , and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2 billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal year 2001 . in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws . * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * * electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy . first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . * commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty : that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together on market structure . the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to do their job . * if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers , * he cautioned , they * will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path . * new generation * * * dynegy to build second plant in kentucky * * * dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the riverside generating project in lawrence county , kentucky . dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market . commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002 . * * * ppl to expand generation capacity * * * ppl corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near chicago and would increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts . ceo william hecht said the illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002 . * * * constellation energy group announces eight new plants * * * constellation energy group this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer . additionally , four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers . the four peaking plants are located in illinois , pennsylvania , virginia and west virginia . the larger power plants are under construction in california , florida , illinois , and texas . * we   re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business , * said constellation energy group chairman and ceo christian poindexter . * * * california energy commission approves construction of otay mesa generating plant * * * pg & e corporation   s national energy group ( neg ) last week announced that the california energy commission ( cec ) has approved construction of the otay mesa generating plant in san diego county , which the neg has developed . the 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1 , 000 homes . after the development process is completed , calpine corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant . neg will contract for up to half the plants output . energy data * * * weekly electric output ( week 15 ) * * * electric output reached 63 , 528 gwh for the week ending april 14 ( week 15 ) , with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the south central states , which both had a 12 . 6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15 . year -

2	Subject: re : risk metrics i completely agree with you . nevertheless , i am sorry if i did not make myself clear when we talked about this last tuesday : i am not advocating penalizing business units because of their lweek rovars or sharpes . i would certainly not set traders ' bonuses based on these numbers ( nor do i think anyone at enron would consider doing that ) . enron focuses on long term profit and risk . however , the long term is made up of many short terms , and catastrophes can occur if a company ' s management does not pay close attention to the latter . indeed , enron management is very interested in short term profitability ( they want to be notified of very large 1 and 5 day losses ) and short term risk ( we report daily var limit violations ) . in this spirit , i am simply offering 1 and 4 week rovars and sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the dpr database , and i will let upper management use or ignore them as they see fit . regards , eugenio naveen andrews @ enron 09 / 08 / 2000 11 : 13 am to : eugenio perez / hou / ect @ ect cc : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : risk metrics eugenio , in regard to your recent e - mail concerning rovar , sharpe and other risk metrics , and our meeting on tuesday , it is imperative to understand that ( 1 ) while p & l is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis , var numbers on 1 - week or 4 - week basis , and consequently rovar numbers , are not meaningful operationally ( ie , trading activity and senior management decision - making ) and statistically . rovar and sharpe were designed to measure business unit performance over extended time periods ( preferably a year ) . specifically , you cannot penalize , or make reasonable business decisions about a unit , because of their 1 - week rovar or sharpe . ( 2 ) significant trading activity at ene is composed of long - term strategic trades ( seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months , perhaps ) , wherein desk heads and senior management have an intuitive feeling for their rovar ( over 6 months ) . a 1 - week or 4 - week " interim " number in this case is not useful . traders might purposefully want to make a certain 1 - week or 4 - week rovar low in their trading activity if they believe their 6 - month number can be high . in such a case , a 1 - week number might send dangerous messages to senior management . ( 3 ) conceptually , p & l and var , in isolation , are numbers which are sound and rigourously calculated . the ratio , however , one has to be careful about . the numerator ( cumulative p & l over a certain period ) can be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation , no problems . however , the denominator ( average daily var over a certain period ) relies on the underlying assumption that each point in your time series is independent and correlationless . to get a sufficient statistic for the denominator , one would have to take a large sample in your series ( 6 months or more ) , for a daily average var number to be meaningful , statistically . ( 4 ) the rac group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage for over two years . the numbers are shown to the b . o . d with the express intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6 - month or yearly tenor . please contact matthew adams ( rac ) or myself to make sure that we are on the same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics . also , in the future , just to be consistent and on - the - same - page , please contact me or mr . adams if any risk - related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum . ( 5 ) finally , as you can probably corroborate , senior management might not be fully versed on the nuances of var , let alone 1 - week var ratios . therefore , one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics . i liked your presentation of your database on tuesday . i think it is a nice step in aggregating and dissecting p & l from disparate sources . best regards naveen

" we chose to file for chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution , which thus far the state and the state ' s regulators have been unable to achieve , " said robert d . glynn , jr . , chairman of pacific gas and electric company . " the regulatory and political processes have failed us , and now we are turning to the court . " glynn added , " our objective is to move through the chapter 11 reorganization process as quickly as possible , without disruption to our operations or inconvenience to our customers . throughout this crisis , our 20 , 000 employees have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the 13 million californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity . " pacific gas and electric company decided to file for the protection of chapter 11 primarily due to : - - failure by the state to assume the full procurement responsibility for pacific gas and electric ' s " net open position " as was provided under ablx . this has the result of increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs , which the utility estimates to be approximately $ 300 million or more per month . - - the impact of actions by the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) on march 27 , 2001 , and april 3 , 2001 , that created new payment obligations for the company and undermined its ability to return to financial viability . - - lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide recovery of $ 9 billion in wholesale power purchases made by the utility since june 2000 , which have not been recoverable in frozen rates . - - the adoption by the cpuc of an illegal and retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true uncollected wholesale costs . " in addition , despite pacific gas - - pacific gas and electric would have been able to enter into long - term power purchase contracts at prices lower than those announced by the state ; - - the state would not have had to almost exhaust the state ' s budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase power for the utility ' s customers ; - - the state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in bonds to cover these power purchases ; and - - the state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend billions of dollars to purchase the state ' s three investor - owned utility ' s electric transmission systems . " this year , the state has spent more than $ 3 billion on power purchases and , with the cpuc , has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses , " noted glynn . " in contrast , since june pacific gas and electric company has spent $ 9 billion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue borrowing , but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law . " statements by the governor and other public officials since last september gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the context of chapter 11 that would restore the utility ' s financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably . however , these statements have not been followed up by constructive actions , and a reorganization in chapter 11 is now the most feasible means of resolution . " the utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its business during bankruptcy , including paying vendors and suppliers in full for goods and services received after the filing . the utility will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law . the utility intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions during the chapter 11 process . employees will continue to be paid . health care plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue . the utility ' s qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded and protected by federal law . notice a media teleconference will be held today at 10 : 15 a . m . pacific daylight time to discuss this announcement . pacific gas and electric company chairman robert d . glynn , jr . , and pacific gas and electric company president and ceo gordon r . smith will be available for questions . the dial - in number is 888 / 469 - 2078 , and the password for access is " media .

" investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , " launer said . some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke . " this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , " said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .

" questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses . the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading . according to the annual report the " related party transactions " , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively . mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were . they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp . " we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , " added mr lay . the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions . enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating . an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion . the sec inquiry is " informal " , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment . enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 10 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on " certain related - party transactions " that had been previously disclosed to the sec . " we welcome this request , " said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive . " we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , " he said . the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water . investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn . in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning . skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure . on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments . but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the " early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . " in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions . but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion . the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported . lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed . a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court . many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say . investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses . and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released . analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a " hold " from a " buy " rating monday out of such frustration . coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron . but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong . " i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , " he said . investors are panicking because of a " bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , " said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) . factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best curves available at this time . the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a 2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not optimal . hence ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the " most accurate " , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different inputs . ( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way , however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let our it staff know that . ( 3 ) checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in . however , as you know , there could be disconnects with enpower , etc . in any event , it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis . your help is appreciated . regards naveen

2	Subject: re : hiring practices for summer interns sally , thanks for the email and update . i agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this . i believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip . i know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that you got last year ( i was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation ) . we cant lose that momentum . i am sure that each school ' s program is different and that most don ' t interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what i have learned about the ou schedule , we will lose all the top candidates if we wait . i am sure that is not what charlene and celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines . please keep me up informed on this matter . thanks and good luck with the students . mike enron north america corp . from : sally beck 10 / 02 / 2000 07 : 13 pm to : charlene jackson / corp / enron @ enron , celeste roberts / hou / ect @ ect cc : richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , mike mcconnell / hou / ect @ ect subject : hiring practices for summer interns while recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made at the program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns . in talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university of oklahoma , it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with enron , as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns . i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her manager , shelley jones , and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enron ' s staffing . when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews , i was even more concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data . it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs . i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley , with no resolution . when they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns , i volunteered to have james scribner , a senior director on my team , obtain this market information . lexi and shelley either did not have the time to gather this data , or were not sure how to do so . they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information . i now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions . and based on this information , i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall . while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits , i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many , if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting . as administrators of the program , you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the enron message to campus . i believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two - way messaging system . i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly , as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days . i suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the program ' s decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships . in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell , executive sponsors for ut and ou , respectively , they are as concerned as i about the decision on interviewing summer interns . i have copied both of them on this note to the two of you . please let me know how this can be resolved . with the help of james scribner and others , we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships . i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around .

" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .

2	Subject: anthrax scare in dc house speaker hastert has decided to close the entire capitol complex , including the office buildings on the house side , at the end of the working day today through monday , as a precautionary move to allow for special agents and germ experts to conduct a sweep of the ventilation systems and all remaining unopened mail . the senate side is expected to do the same . it has also been confirmed that the anthrax - laden letter sent to senate majority leader daschle ' s office was of a particularly potent , high grade military quality anthrax that quickly spread once opened . some 29 staff in dachle ' s office or the mail room have tested positive , and some anthrax spores were found in the ventilation system of the hart building ( where daschle ' s office is located ) and in one of the tunnels leading to the capitol itself . if there is even a hint that this military grade anthrax came from iraq , there will be a strike by the u . s . against iraq . another possibility is that the anthrax is of russian origin and was somehow illicitly acquired by al qaeda or the taliban . there has not been a second anthrax letter or a new outbreak of anthrax , nor is there any evidence of anthrax spores spreading to committee rooms located in the other senate or house buildings . this was a pre - cautionary move by house speaker hastert , though it in no way diminishes how ugly the situation is .

2	Subject: personal contact from the desk of : mr paolo abate . banca intesa , torino agenzia 3 , piazza della repubblica , torino italy . alternative email address : p _ abate 3 @ virgilio . it i am mr . paolo abate , manager of banca intesa private banking sector , torino agenzia 3 , torino , italy . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . on june 6 , 1999 , mr . richard smith came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 5 . 7 million usd , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . based on the investment , we spun the money around which with accrued profit and interest stood at over 6 . 5 million united states dollars . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in antwerp . he directed that i liquidate the funds and have it deposited with a firm in brussels . i informed him that banca intesa would have to make special arrangements to have this don and in order not to circumvent due process ; the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in brussels and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the uk based security consultancy firm . mr . richard . smith told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th october 2001 . in june later year , we got a call from uk based firm informing us about the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned ; given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at uk based firm and i could not understand why mr . richard . had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate mr . richard no success , four weeks later , information started to trickle in , apparently mr . richard smith was dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . i mr . richard smith died in testate . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man  s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct uk based firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to mr . richard . i will then officially communicate with uk based firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have uk based firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from uk we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you regards paolo abate . mail sent from white revolution - http : / / www . whiterevolution . com

2	Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly " unwilling to fight " for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would " double dip " into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would " eat " the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .

2	Subject: re : enymex brad , we may consider targeting a wide audience . since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities , our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse . our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $ 31 mm ( plus option fees ) . i have two primary documents . one is the spec sheet and a general scope . the other is a turbine purchase agreement . a counterparty can have two options : one is to contact us to provide a bid . there would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case . their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract . for $ 1 mm , they would have a 30 day call on the turbines , during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence . the $ 1 mm buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period . it may be a nuance , but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine . is this consistent with eol ' s format ?

2	Subject: partnership request request for urgent business relationship dear sir , firstly , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and  top secret .  though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you . so we decided it is best using the email . let me start by first introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . osaro ame , a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a three - man tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power . the duties of the committee also include evaluation , vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign and local contractors in the ministry . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . in order to commence this business , we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : between 1996 and 1997 , this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering , procurement , supply of electrical equipments such as transformers , and some rural electrification projects . however , these contracts were over - invoiced by the committee , thereby , leaving the sum of us $ 11 . 5 million dollars ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) in excess . this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved . the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts , leaving the balance of $ 11 . 5 m dollars , which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off - shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves . we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors . we are handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service code of conduct , does not allow us to operate off - shore accounts , hence your importance in the whole transaction is highly needed . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount of us $ 11 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) , while 70 % will be for us ( members of this panel ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses incurred ( both local and foreign ) in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here , the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub - contracted it out to other companies . more often than not , big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts . we are civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a life time opportunity . you must however , note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below , as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts . we have decided that this transaction will be based completely on the following : ( a ) . our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence . ( b ) . that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality . ( c ) . that upon receipt of the funds , you will promptly release our share ( 70 % ) on demand after you have removed your 20 % and all expenses have been settled . ( d ) . you must be ready to produce us with enough information about yourself to put our minds at rest . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary information and requirement from you . endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my email fax number 1 - 443 - 658 - 2542 or my email address and i will bring you into the complete picture of this transaction when i have heard from you . your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for this financial quarter . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . osaro ame do you yahoo ! ? yahoo ! health - your guide to health and wellness http : / / health . yahoo . com

2	Subject: organization announcement enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however , with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business e - commerce venture . effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand for products and services with the objective of creating a future business - to - business e - commerce venture . it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director , will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology . george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . ( " tgs " ) from june 1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline company . please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating george in his new role with the company .

2	Subject: storage model change : commodity delta dear all , i change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value before . the total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at given status ( initial conditions ) . the way i calculate the unit value is ( total pv - s * capacity taken ) / total capacity which could suffer some negative numbers since s , the spot price could be very high . the correct way is to define the s as the average injection gas price , but this would be troublesome to compute . by switching to total pv , the delta can be interpreted as total commodity delta for the hedge . actually , duffie also suggested using the total pv as the output in his audit review . i have attached the xll model below . zimin

( ene ) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company ' s bonds monday . on sunday , the independent in london reported that royal dutch petroleum co . ( rd ) planned to mount an $ 11 billion offering for the company . and barron ' s stated that there was speculation that enron might attract takeover interest from either royal dutch or warren buffet ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka ) . enron ' s bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to treasury bond issues . a $ 74 bid and a $ 77 offer was quoted as the market for enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % bonds of 2003 monday morning , similar to friday ' s levels . " the company ' s bonds were quoted in the low - to mid - 70 s on friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing , " said wayne schmidt , portfolio manager , advantus capital management , st . paul , minn . " market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds , " said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . even an enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par , traders said . the 6 . 45 % coupon bond due on november 15 , 2001 , less than two weeks away , was bid at a dollar price of 99 . " some investors don ' t want to own anything with a downside risk , " said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin & co . , a distressed debt brokerage firm , princeton , n . j . the bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame , with little upside potential gain , he added . there is " very little liquidity in the company ' s bonds , " said rivkin . enron ' s bonds will follow the company ' s stock movements , he added . enron closed monday at $ 11 . 03 , down $ 0 . 27 from friday ' s close of $ 11 . 30 . enron officials weren ' t immediately available to comment . crisis of investor confidence the houston - based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month . and last wednesday , the company said that the securities and exchange commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the ratings agencies have reacted to the company ' s liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence . fitch downgraded enron ' s senior unsecured debt monday to triple - b - minus , from triple - b - plus . it ' s now just a notch away from junk bond status . last week , standard & poor ' s corp . lowered the credit rating to triple - b , while moody ' s investors service lowered the rating to baa 2 . shell may have interest , but royal dutch shell may have an interest in enron , say analysts . " shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to expand in north america and latin america , " said tina vital , equity analyst , standard 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . market views enron takeover rumors with skepticism by christina cheddar of dow jones newswires 11 / 05 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - with each day shedding light on new revelations about enron corp . ' s ( ene ) financial dealings , it is difficult to put odds on the company as a takeover target . but speculation has been persistent that royal dutch / shell group may use enron ' s weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover . over the weekend , the british newspaper , the independent , fanned the flames of speculation again by saying that shell was expected to offer $ 11 billion for the houston energy trader . a shell spokesman wasn ' t immediately available . surely , enron ' s thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a company such as the anglo - dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the u . s . natural gas market , where shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence . however , a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company ' s financial structure . enroll has used a web of off - balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs . some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off its balance sheet . several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such as shell would want to make an acquisition while a securities and exchange commission investigation is pending . as for enron ' s core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is enron ' s staff . as a result , it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile transactions . shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing and trading sector through its coral energy unit , and the acquisition of enron could give it instant clout in the market . also , shell ' s strong balance sheet would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness . traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it would be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation calmed and more details of enron ' s business are uncovered . a growth - fund manager , who requested anonymity , also said it is important to know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in enron ' s stock price . he speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock . enron shares recently traded at $ 11 . 14 , down 16 cents , or 1 . 4 % . the stock began the day in positive territory , and traded as high as $ 12 . 20 intraday . the stock has declined more than 60 % since the company in mid - october posted a third - quarter charge of more than $ 1 billion . the company also later disclosed an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andy fastow . in the weeks that followed the disclosure , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded by moody ' s investor service , standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones they are very smart and very wise to the ways of wall street , main street and the oil patch . norman blake is a gent i met years ago at usfg , before he sold it at a huge profit . this man has recently served as ceo of comdisco , a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing , it is wallowing in it . blake has general electric training . this man can smell things that are not so right from miles away . where was he in all of this ? stuck in comdisco hell ? ronnie chan is a longtime kingpin in hong kong , a place where financial originality is always on display . chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared . he ' s seen everything over in kong . john duncan is an energy investment guy , a director of eott energy , and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting . again , very sophisticated . wendy gramm regulated derivatives . she was the chairman of the cftc and a director of the chicago mercantile exchange . how could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed ? that was part of her old job . robert jaedicke was a professor of accounting at stanford business school , where he was also dean . this guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming . ( i am skipping ken lay , the ceo . ) charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn , two execs from the university of texas m . d . anderson cancer center , can ' t be expected to catch this stuff , and therefore gets a pass from me . paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro . that ' s probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations . how could he not raise a word about it ? frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international , perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management . i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enron ' s looking through his own company ' s portfolio of investments . jeffrey skilling , the man who resigned as ceo , needs to be heard from . we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas , a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don ' t get hold . what did he know and when did he know it ? john wakeham , lord wakeham to everybody , is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament . he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant . he ' s big and powerful and smart . herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central , a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations . in short , this is the most sophisticated , hands - on group of folks i have come across . i can ' t believe they checked off on this stuff . i have to believe they didn ' t know , or if they knew of the partnerships , i believe they had no idea what they were doing . i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enron ' s credit rating with the agencies - - not that that ' s such an ethical setup . but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant , as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were . still , let ' s not fool ourselves . this was a powerhouse , fantastic , upright board of people who know a thing or two . i can ' t believe they let this stuff occur . i think they knew nothing . which is pretty terrible in its own right . this market deserves your well - placed optimism by james j . cramer > realmoney . com 11 / 05 / 2001 10 : 32 am est url : > d ? j ? vu circa 1991 . that ' s what i keep thinking about . i recall that time vividly . bank of boston , chase , chemical , citibank , they all started rallying . we bears would call each other and joke about it . we would say that it was a ridiculous move , that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively , because there was no way that any of these banks would make it . heck , bank of boston was teetering on insolvency . citibank was technically bankrupt already . the jim grants of the world ( more powerful now than they were then because he didn ' t have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt ) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying . i would call the analysts , and they wouldn ' t know anything either - - the ones who liked the banks all the way down , who still liked them and who had no credibility at all . the ones who hated them didn ' t want to get off the winning horses . they didn ' t know that the race was over and that a new one had begun . or , to put it the brutal way that i now know was right : no one with a brain was long any of these . turns out , of course , that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom . what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism , because at certain points in history optimists get it right . that ' s how i feel about this market . i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred . i think we will look back at this period and say the following : the great bear market started in march 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until sept . 11 , the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around . most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come . they were wrong , just like they were in 1991 . we get so caught up in the " is cisco bottoming ? " or " is intel breaking out ? " minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now , pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago . you would think that we ' d have converted more bears to bulls by now , but like in 1991 , it didn ' t happen until well into the turn . don ' t confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities . i think that , for example , xo communications is going to fail , and when it does , there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech . i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same . there are a ton of companies that won ' t get through this period , just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991 . and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks . i can ' t get my arms around how ford comes back ; i don ' t understand the enron fiasco at all . i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding . but that doesn ' t make me bearish . understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature . had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991 , had i not personally been " bought in " on a half - dozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from super - regionals not long after i , too , would be suspicious and want to bet against the market . i can ' t , though , because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i don ' t want to get burned by again . believe me , i am a cold - blooded individual about these things . if i thought the short side was the right side here , i would be all over it . we have had a huge bounce off the bottom ; there would be nothing " unpatriotic " about saying " get out now . " but i don ' t think that ' s right . i think this market ' s going to keep working here . if it doesn ' t , people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me , and i will say , c ' est la vie , i took a stand ; it was wrong . taking stands , however , is what it is all about . knowing your context and making money with that context is what i do and have done for 20 years . if you don ' t have a context , if you don ' t have a view , there ' s only one thing to do : give your money to others who do . random musings : glenn curtis ' s era of value newsletter has been making me money . when something makes me money i talk about it . check it out here . curtis and gary b . smith both are doing some terrific things . understand , i get all of the newsletters out there . i see the hype that a navallier or a murphy puts out and i want to puke . this stuff is nothing like that , nothing at all . it is honest , candid and doesn ' t guarantee that you will shoot the lights out , like those who you know can ' t . . . on my radio show , it ' s mutual fund monday , where we will fix your 401 ( k ) ) . call me at 1 - 800 - 862 - 8686 from 3 p . m . to 4 p . m . et .

2	Subject: message subject think getting a 1 . 95 % rate is impossible ? think again ! we can offer you the absolute rock - bottom lowest rate , guaranteed . we work with all credit types . visit our site now , for your rate quote . click here now ! now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review of the two systems . i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit , both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest . the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) . after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored comedy ) , and a few more " experimental " music channels which most will find totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular ( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion . the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) . this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my cancelling xm . xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan . xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) . however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .

2	Subject: re : corn subsidy govt program analysis vasant , thanks . let ' s contact wharton next week . vince from : vasant shanbhogue / enron @ enronxgate on 04 / 25 / 2001 10 : 15 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : nelson neale / na / enron @ enron subject : corn subsidy govt program analysis hi vince , nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program . the consensus from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven , ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures . also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before , lending more credibility in the ag community . the names that came up were mississippi state and texas a & m . nelson knows of a person at mississippi state who worked with the usda on risk management issues . the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep , and the focus is primarily to get a non - quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk ) . the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination . another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received - - we still have unlimited downside from the short . vasant p . s . i am writing up jim bouillion ' s project suggestion as a potential project for wharton . of course , we may still ask wharton for their insights on the corn price protection approach .

2	Subject: ou recruiting sally , over the past year or so enron has made a great impact at the university of oklahoma . in a very short time we have become one of the employers of of choice within the college of business . we have been able to do this by paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary . we have formed great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to come , if we do not become complacent . i for one am an example of the impression that enron has forged at ou . i am here because i believe that enron represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry , but the but the business world in general . i am sending this note because i believe we are taking steps that will lessen our momentum at the university of oklahoma . i have learned that we will not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall . as you know , last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment after our presentations . being a student at the time i felt this was a great idea and i know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well . they felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from enron representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided . as i understand the a / a program now takes the position that this does not provide any residual value for enron and does not warrant the expense . i do not understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an arrangement . it places another selling point on our presentation and gives us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent . this may seem like an insignificant detail , but i hope we will see the value that this opportunity presents . the students of the em program and the j . c . penney leadership program are expecting another exciting evening from enron and hate to see us fall short of these expectations . it is very likely that if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will . the competition for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident in our recruiting efforts . enron is a great place to work and we must take that image to campus . i know that mr . mcconnell is a very exciting speaker and will no doubt amaze those present . that is why we should take this simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and continue our path to recruiting dominance at the university of oklahoma . i am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting ou within enron ' s sights . your involvement at ou is greatly appreciated and i hope you maintain your interest in the university of oklahoma . please consider my views on this matter and express any concerns of your own to the analyst and associate program . thank you , jody crook

2	Subject: var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince

2	Subject: re : henwood query good talking with you this morning . by all means , talk to grant masson about who else is using the henwood model within enron . attached are the workbooks i mentioned . the " details of jan and july . xls " workbook contains the resulting listing from the query i gave you yesterday and you can see how the supply curve was created from that . the supply curve becomes nonsense at points for reasons i believe are related to reliability commitment constrants , instead of pure economic dispatch , and to the aggregate reporting problem i described in my note yesterday . the workbook " supply curve . xls " has the simplistic , average supply curve i mentioned , constructed from fuel and vom costs . depending on the question you are trying to answer , it may be an approach to consider . the henwood contacts i had in mind are : tao guo , phd , senior " algorithmist " ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * the one i was thinking of wenxiong huang , phd senior project consultant ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) ajit kulkarni , phd , software product manager ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * more a trainer , but sharp cosimo coscia , senior consultant ( south australia ) 618 - 8357 - 1244 * very resourceful wade schauer , staff consultant , ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * best for questions about emss per se all have emails , of course . template : tguo @ hesinet . com also , if you can not get satisfaction , contact eric toolson , vp ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) . he has a laconic style , but is very focused on customer satisfaction and retention . and he has the pull to make things happen . regards , michael > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > > michael , i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and consequently the person to contact in case of problems . i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though , marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows : for each hour , for each generating station : " marginal cost " [ o / mwh ]  ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] - vom _ cost [ o / mwh ] this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results . do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ? it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much . regards karolina

( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar distribution group , inc . " vdg , " forming a revolutionary new music company , controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a 33 % stake in the new company . roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder approval immediately thereafter . pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , " this alliance will allow pop 3 to achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . " roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry today . " it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , " stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo . " additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our artists . " mr . shebanow concluded , " while there are smaller labels that do provide a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

( yes - apologies if there is confusion ) with regard to a global message , i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities . with these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide . these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations . i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across . agreed - but the note was targeted at europe - would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and shona ) finally , a question regarding timing . the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( shona took this to do after brent ' s return to houston ) for comments to all business controllers . i don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards . and not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards . my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year . there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report . shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this , and i believe that mike has already been working with james new . so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against . would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ? can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to shona sorry that this response looks so long . i have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so i hope that it makes sense . thanks for sharing this with me . since you asked for input , i hope that you don ' t mind that i gave you some . - - sally - certainly not - and thanks mike jordan 09 / 26 / 2000 08 : 14 am to : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : a note being sent out under john sherriff ' s name - your thoughts on the cover note ? fernley / sally off and on ( with jackie gentle ' s help ) i have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ) . we are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash ( the enron europe newsletter ) have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ? mike

2	Subject: re : enron online case chris - - in response to your e - mail , here are some quantitative facts that will give your students some insights about the scope of the economic return created by enrononline . 1 . enrononline supports enron ' s wholesale services division . in 2000 , ibit ( income before interest , minority interests and taxes ) for enron wholesale services division rose 72 % to $ 2 . 3 billion , with record physical energy volumes of 51 . 7 trillion british thermal units equivalent per day ( tbtue / d ) - - a 59 % increase over 1999 . both of these growth rates were very significantly higher than growth rates we experienced in previous years . for example , for the past five years , wholesale services earnings have grown at an average compunded growth rate of 48 % annually . 2 . it took nearly a decade for enron ' s daily gas transactions in north america to reach 13 . 9 bcf in 1999 . just 12 months later , enrononline had helped to practically double daily transactions to 24 . 7 bcf . if you have any questions on this , please call me at 713 853 9354 . thanks kal shah enrononline - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 8 : 39 am to : patrick , christie cc : cbartlett @ hbs . edu ; kal shah / hou / ect @ enron subject : re : enron online case hello chris and christie , i have asked kal shah to run with getting you what you need to ensure that you will have a contact during my absence . i have copied kal on this email and hope that this works for everyone . thanks louise christie patrick 05 / 03 / 2001 01 : 12 pm to : cbartlett @ hbs . edu cc : ( bcc : louise kitchen / hou / ect ) subject : enron online case hi chris ! thanks for the message and the great experience at harvard last week ! harvard ' s hospitality was the best ! ! i ' m travelling right now and only have a minute , but i ' ve passed along your request to louise and will follow up with her and the totality of your request on monday .

2	Subject: organizational changes changes in enron ' s business require us to reevaluate how we approach the engineering and construction function within enron . specifically , enron energy services ' ( ees ) business has grown dramatically and that requires considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers . additionally , in light of enron ' s continued emphasis on increasing our return on invested capital , we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction projects around the world . historically , these projects have been a primary focus of eecc ' s activities . consequently we are making the following organizational changes concerning eecc : eecc ' s pipeline construction group , led by jerry martin , will become part of enron transportation services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant construction services to enron entities and third parties . the remainder of eecc will become part of ees . larry izzo will report to the ees office of the chairman . these changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth opportunities within enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our employees . please join us in supporting and implementing these changes .

" the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy . the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco . chewco was established in 1997 " with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments " to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document . enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco . mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that " michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . " mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july . this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves " any director or executive officer . " by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have . however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a " material " piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and " other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management .

" many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises . strong selling by company officers and directors amid share - price declines should raise red flags for investors , says jonathan moreland , research director of insiderinsights . com , who uses insider - trading data to zero in on investment ideas . among other insiders selling during the year , kenneth rice , former chairman and ceo of enron ' s broadband unit , sold shares for $ 23 . 7 million . mr . rice has sold 456 , 966 shares of the 1 . 5 million shares he was listed as owning in enron ' s march proxy filing . former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling - - who resigned in august - - sold 160 , 000 shares for $ 9 . 8 million during the year . in march , mr . skilling owned 1 . 9 million shares . messrs . rice and skilling couldn ' t be reached to comment . overall , enron ' s insiders were busier selling shares last year , when they sold 5 . 8 million shares for about $ 449 million . during 1999 , insiders sold 3 . 4 million shares for $ 123 . 1 million . since december 1999 , only one enron executive has reported buying company shares . the buyer was andrew fastow , who was ousted during the week as enron ' s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr . fastow . mr . fastow reported purchasing 10 , 000 enron shares in august at $ 36 . 98 each , or a total of $ 369 , 800 . today , those shares are valued at $ 163 , 500 , based on enron ' s stock price of $ 16 . 35 in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . after the purchase , mr . fastow owned 110 , 586 shares , thomson financial / lancer analytics says . enron said mr . fastow wasn ' t available to comment . on monday , a new york law firm filed suit in u . s . district court in houston , alleging that enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by mr . fastow . the suit , which seeks class - action status , also says enron insiders sold $ 73 million of their own enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets enron ' s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit - rating concerns by jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee staff reporters of the wall street journal 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 5 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - - enron corp . ' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse . not for long , some bond traders say . in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks . that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of " spread " is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower . enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade . fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer . " even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest , " said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j . in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a " default swap " - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year . even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level . yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to " negative , " citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . ) meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . " these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels , " said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . " they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction . " if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments . enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets . enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity . " even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating , the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses , " said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . " any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron ' s counterparties " - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - " is going to be examining their exposure to enron , and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it , " mr . reynolds said . to be sure , enron , despite its recent woes , remains a strong company , credit analysts said . " i don ' t think anyone ' s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default , " mr . reynolds said . " so far , our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them , " said ron barone , managing director of standard & poor ' s utility energy project finance group . " no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it ' s business as usual . " yet analysts say the arrival of distressed - debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for enron and its management . traders expect enron ' s new chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon and chairman kenneth lay to make the rounds of wall street next week , meeting with rating agencies , debt - trading desks , big bond holders and banks , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . treasurys treasurys rallied on optimism that the federal reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week ' s flood of treasury , corporate and agency debt issues . at 4 p . m . edt , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 13 / 32 point , or $ 4 . 0625 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 103 20 / 32 . its yield fell to 4 . 537 % from 4 . 588 % wednesday , as yields move inversely to prices . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price was up 22 / 32 point at 101 11 / 32 to yield 5 . 284 % , down from 5 . 330 % wednesday . fed policy makers are slated to meet on nov . 6 . also providing support for longer maturities , the treasury department made another repurchase of issues outstanding . it received offers for $ 5 . 04 billion in callable 30 - year bonds , of which it accepted $ 1 billion . the offer - to - cover ratio , an indication of demand , was 5 . 04 . treasury buyback par par high wtd avg coupon mat amt amt accept accept % date offer accept price price 7 . 125 02 / 23 807 0 n / a n / a 11 . 750 02 / 10 235 0 n / a n / a 10 . 000 05 / 10 490 0 n / a n / a 12 . 750 11 / 10 471 0 n / a n / a 13 . 875 05 / 11 104 0 n / a n / a 14 . 000 11 / 11 203 0 n / a n / a 10 . 375 11 / 12 587 0 n / a n / a 12 . 000 08 / 13 974 0 n / a n / a 13 . 250 05 / 14 473 0 n / a n / a 12 . 500 08 / 14 725 39 3152 . 20 152 . 19 11 . 750 11 / 14 7826 0 7148 . 25 148 . 13 amounts in millions , prices in decimals . * amount outstanding after operation . calculated using amounts reported on announcement . corporate bonds motorola inc .

" so is this a stock to avoid , in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its " u . s . select list , " which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious " recommended list " of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 . " just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , ' " says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . " if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow . " enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week . " every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box , " says jim chanos , principal of kynikos associates in new york , who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . " it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . " true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had . but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ? concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions . besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings . through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a " strong buy " or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a " buy , " though not strongly . only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a " sell " rating on enron . the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted . over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue . enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch . " enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved , " says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a " strong buy " with a $ 40 price target . " they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . " he adds , " we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that ' s ludicrous . we ' re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes , i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don ' t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . " mr . fleischer , whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron , calls his holding " a meaningful investment " that is " not small . " but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients " are happy to know " he has a stake in enron , because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is . in his research note wednesday , mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company , he wrote that he and many other investors historically " have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings " and position as an industry leader . " there ' s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they ' re going to make their money , but every quarter they do , " he says . " it ' s hard to get inside to know all the transactions , but they do deliver . " csfb ' s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company , occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday , he wrote that he expects questions about enron ' s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue , but that he remains " confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . " " i know i ' m wrong on the stock , " mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices , he isn ' t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares , diluting current holders - - the stock doesn ' t have much further to fall . clearly , messrs . launer and flesicher aren ' t alone . " even in relative terms , analysts remain very bullish on this stock , " says chuck hill , director of research at thomson financial / first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 , or slightly shy of a " buy " rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . " this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out , " mr . hill says . in downgrading the stock this week , prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to " sell " from " buy , " with a brief stop at " hold . " while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock , she openly concedes her recent downgrades come " too little , too late . " ms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company ' s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal , and senior executives are often evasive , even when presented with direct questions . for instance , she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said " no , " she says . in light of the company ' s acknowledgment this week of an sec " inquiry , " she asked enron about the previous denial . " they told me it is an inquiry , not an investigation , " she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec ' s inquiry only last wednesday . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence 2001 - 10 - 26 08 : 52 ( new york ) enron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , whose stock has fallen on concern about the largest energy trader ' s transactions with affiliates , drew down $ 3 billion in credit to restore confidence in its financial strength . the houston - based company will use about $ 2 . 2 billion to pay off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash , spokesman mark palmer said . ` ` nothing instils confidence like cash , ' ' he said . enron ' s shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as investors worry that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . investors say they are worried about $ 3 . 3 billion in liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell enron assets . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the company $ 35 million . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay said in a statement . enron shares fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 yesterday . - - mark johnson in the princeton newsroom ( 609 ) 750 - 4662 , or at enron liked by analysts despite complicated dealings , wsj says 2001 - 10 - 26 06 : 12 ( new york ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is liked by many wall street analysts despite lingering questions about the power trading company ' s complicated partnership transactions and the techniques used to record earnings , the wall street journal reported in its ` ` heard on the street ' ' column . goldman sachs group inc . analyst david fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares , said that even though inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the company , that doesn ' t mean he will write off the industry or not analyze enron . of the 17 analysts who follow the stock , 10 had a ` ` strong buy ' ' or equivalent rating , according to thomson financial / first call , the paper said . five rated it ` ` buy ' ' and one had a ` ` sell ' ' on enron . most analysts have stuck by the company , publicly dismissing questions about enron ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure , the journal said . the securities and exchange commission is inquiring about partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . enron draws down $ 3 billion from its credit lines , wsj reports 2001 - 10 - 26 00 : 28 ( new york ) new york , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion of its available credit , the bulk of its bank credit lines , to restore confidence in the financial strength of the company , the wall street journal reported . the energy trading company , whose shares have fallen 52 percent since oct . 16 , will use part of the money to redeem about $ 1 . 85 billion short - term commercial debt , the wall street journal reported , citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter . enron is talking to banks about a new , multi - billion line of credit , the paper reported , citing the unidentified person . the steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is disrupted , the paper said . enron said in a statement distributed by pr newswire that it drew on its credit lines to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity . the steps come a day after chief financial officer andrew fastow resigned amid a securities and exchange commission probe of partnerships he ran . - - william selway in the san francisco newsroom at ( 415 ) 743 - 3511 , oct . 25 , 2001 , 11 : 22 pm houston chronicle action by enron halts stock ' s fall but credit ratings are being reviewed by laura goldberg copyright 2001 houston chronicle the recent freefall of enron corp .

" earlier thursday , two credit rating agencies took actions regarding enron ' s ratings , which j . p . morgan securities analyst anatol feygin described as " just more negative sentiment .

' ' he spoke favorably of ' ' pro forma ' ' earnings reports , in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty . there was no mention of mr . levitt ' s concerns about improper management of earnings . on the heels of mr . pitt ' s speech , the s . e . c . used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors . the decision itself was reasonable , although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years . but the way the s . e . c . trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog .

' ' mr . pitt talks of companies ' ' getting it right the first time , ' ' which would certainly be nice . but there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting , figuring there will be no real penalty , like a restatement , if they are caught . that would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting . in trying to sound comforting to the accountants ' group - - an organization that , as he noted , he had represented as a lawyer for two decades - - mr . pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence . the proof , of course , will come in the performance . fortunately , the mess at enron gives the s . e . c . a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image . it will take time for the commission to determine if the company ' s accounting was proper . but there need be no delay in forcing enron to clearly explain - - rather than obfuscate as it has so far - - the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer .

" the economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists , " says betsy holahan , a department spokesperson . " war bonds are an additional way for americans to show their patriotism . " for the record , we don ' t think an issue of war bonds would be dumb , just superfluous . after all , nothing ' s stopped americans from buying generic savings bonds - - or better yet , treasuries - - all of which finance spending by the federal government . in the meantime , it ' s a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds - - which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice - - at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop . war bonds notwithstanding , we ' re a long way off from the era of ration books . 3 . enron again last week , we noted the extent of alarm about enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $ 1 . 2 billion , following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high - level transactions . following that disclosure , besieged cfo andrew fastow has finally left the company on what ' s delicately termed a " leave of absence . " in july , fastow exited a limited partnership , from which he had reportedly reaped large profits , after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement . concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence . but that won ' t be an easy task , given the resentment about enron ' s disinclination to explain its problems . one analyst called fastow ' s departure " unsettling , " noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before . sounding a note of exasperation , analysts at j . p . morgan chase , banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock . and there could be more trouble to come : the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions . 4 . gold diggers it ' s understandable that investors felt panicky in september . unfortunately , some reacted by shoving their hard - earned money into gold funds . according to financial research corp . , which tracks fund flows , the specialty precious - metals category was the best - selling equity category during september , with net inflows of $ 101 million . granted , that ' s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world . by comparison , during the same month , large growth funds saw net redemptions of $ 7 . 4 billion . but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy , given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long . sure , under the bizarre circumstances of late , they ' ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop . according to morningstar , the average precious - metals fund is up 10 . 08 % year to date . but over the past five years , the same category lost an embarrassing 14 . 68 % . by comparison , even large - cap growth funds - - everybody ' s favorite whipping boy - - managed to post a positive return . in the same period , they were up 7 . 13 % . moreover , circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades - - a combination of attacks on the u . s . government and war - - still don ' t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly . despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks , they ' re again approaching their pre - sept . 11 levels . it ' s too early to say , but it ' s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again . 5 . amazon amazes once again amazon ( amzn : nasdaq - news - commentary ) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter . well , at least it will post a pro forma operating profit . ok , so maybe that wouldn ' t include amazon ' s service on $ 2 . 17 billion in long - term debt or extraordinary charges . in fact , a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy , meaningless aura of minor triumph . the company still hasn ' t said when it will turn an economic profit . for that matter , even the fourth - quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit , cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier , " there are no guarantees . " amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth - quarter revenue , predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10 % compared with a year ago . third - quarter trends weren ' t encouraging . though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago , revenue from the company ' s core books and music business actually fell 12 % . at least the company has made progress in cutting costs : a spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20 % over the past year . incidentally , in the wake of amazon ' s earnings report , two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock , which has fallen 93 % from its high back in december 1999 . merrill lynch analyst henry blodget and sg cowen analyst scott reamer downgraded the stock to " neutral " from previous buy ratings . " we thought there might be upside to our estimates , " noted blodget . " there wasn ' t .

" the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading firm in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . thursday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion worth of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . it has reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade while standard & poors changed enron ' s credit outlook to negative from stable . moody ' s investors service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade . in order to fall below investment grade , enron ' s credit rating would have to fall several notches . if that were to happen , however , a host of bad consequences could follow . together with the sharp decline in its stock price , a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings . in that event , enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt , diluting the value of existing shares . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were down six cents at $ 16 . 35 . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron chief executive resigns from board of i 2 technologies 10 / 25 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . dallas ( ap ) - kenneth lay , the chairman and chief executive of embattled enron corp . , has resigned from the board of software company i 2 technologies .

" lay resumed the chief executive ' s job at enron in august after jeff skilling surprised investors by leaving the houston - based energy company . enron officials did not immediately return calls from the associated press . in the past week , enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by the company ' s chief financial officer . the official was replaced on tuesday . enron ' s stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified , and the company acknowledged that the u . s . securities and exchange commission was investigating the arrangements i 2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains , and its clients include texas instruments , ford motor co . and dell computer corp . i 2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on oct . 17 after the company reported a $ 5 . 53 billion third - quarter loss and said it would cut 1 , 000 jobs , about one - fifth of the work force . lay joined the board in october 2000 . no replacement was announced . in trading thursday , i 2 shares rose 24 cents to $ 4 . 95 , and enron shares fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . as enron ' s woes unnerve investors about energy sector , analysts say its problems are isolated by brad foss ap business writer 10 / 25 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . new york ( ap ) - as it grew over the past decade into the country ' s largest natural gas and power marketing company , enron corp . became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector . wall street buoyed the stock prices of enron ' s competitors based in part on the huge success of the houston - based company ' s business model . now , executives and industry analysts hope to prevent enron ' s internal tumult and free - falling stock price from undermining investors ' confidence in the sector . they say the houston - based company ' s problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace . " the marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday , a week ago or a month ago , " said jim donnell , president of duke energy north america , a division of duke energy corp . that generates and trades power . that opinion appeared to gain acceptance on thursday as shares of dynegy inc . , el paso corp . and duke energy corp . rebounded from losses on wednesday , when enron ' s latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals . enron ' s stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week ( and nearly 80 percent since january ) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon . the latest troubles began oct . 16 when enron reported third quarter earnings , and a longtime concern among wall street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse . first came reports that some of the company ' s losses stemmed from partnerships managed by enron ' s chief financial officer at the time , andrew fastow . that raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . then on wednesday , one day after enron chairman kenneth lay defended fastow , the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence . " they created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn ' t come through with flying colors , " said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group in new york . enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old , which have little to do with the company ' s wholesale energy business , which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits . analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices . " even though ( enron ) shot themselves in the foot , the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear , " ellinghaus said . ubs warburg analyst ronald barone echoed that sentiment . " the collateral damage to the rest of the space - dynegy and el paso - is overdone , " barone said . on thursday , williams companies inc . of tulsa , okla . , reported net income of $ 760 million and reliant resources inc . of houston reported $ 133 million in profits . " it ' s business as usual , " said dynegy spokesman steve stengel . not for enron , whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india and the surprise departure in august of then - chief executive jeff skilling was considered another bad sign . on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . excluding the charge , enron earned $ 393 million on $ 47 . 6 billion in revenues for the three months ending sept . 30 . ellinghaus said the stocks of enron ' s competitors were brought down wednesday because of " dire " speculation that enron ' s troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as duke and dynegy . " all i ' m hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality , " ellinghaus said . enron did not return calls seeking comment thursday . donnell of duke energy said the charlotte , n . c . - based company is paying close attention to the enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid .

' ' companies that trade as heavily as enron require cash every day to settle positions , said kilduff , whose company swaps natural gas and other energy investments with enron . some days , fimat will bet that natural - gas prices will fall , while enron bets that they will rise . natural gas usually does one or the other every day , and someone pays the difference . ` ` the liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor , ' ' kilduff said . ` ` someone is paying someone else every day .

what are the early warning signs of an impending shakeout ? - which ecommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout ? will there be single or multiple winners ? - which companies are likely to survive ? what strategies will the winners use ? there is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most contribute to prospects for survival . how important are first mover advantages and building brand equity ?

2	Subject: enron networks offsite hi - i just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday . three people spoke at the meeting - jeff mcmahon , louise and philippe . there was a lot of attention given to enrononline and it ' s success . greg whalley spoke via satellite from london . the basic theme was what it is going to take to survive in today ' s fast moving markets and how we are going to get there , and that in five years all businesses will be internet companies or not companies at all . . . . . greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do this but us because of our financial capabilities , reputation , and it resources . louise went over statistics , products offered , etc . on enrononline . philippe discussed all the it projects in the works - the key one for ena was enhancement of deal capture , valuation and settlements ( no surprises there ! ) . one other common theme was streamlining our current systems . he also confirmed the fact that we were moving from lotus notes to exchange , and discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our equipment ( and the ability to keep the room cool ) so they were looking to ardmore for this . jeff m . stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on inefficiencies in the market , and get into other industries ( e . g . mg metals in europe ) . he also stated that enron was going to venture capitalists for financial support and backing . of course , this means that enron will have to give up some control , but it leads to increased deal flow , market share and new ideas . . . . he said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of $ 1 b - most likely in q 3 . i tried to capture the main topics , let me know if you have any questions ! sheri

2	Subject: macro questions i hope this gets mark what he needs . let me know . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by kevin m presto / hou / ect on 03 / 13 / 2001 03 : 45 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - george hopley 03 / 13 / 2001 03 : 40 pm to : kevin m presto / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : macro questions is the country facing sustained tight markets ? : in general , capacity margins have been falling over the last few years as utilities have refraind from building baseload capacity , and others have focused on developing primarily peaking capacity . the last large building boom of coal plants ended in early 1970 ' s and nuclear boom dropped sharply after three mile island incident in 1979 . during 1990 ' s , projected capacity margins have fallen from the 15 - 20 % toward 10 % and below . outside of the california situation , nyc also poses a potential risk for this summer . if general , however , by 2002 - 2003 , the amount of capacity proposed in each region more than covers normal load growth for meeting peak hour demand . remaining question relates to performance of existing coal and nuclear stacks , also what happens during periods of persistent drought . will voaltility and prices remain high or lessen ? : to the extent that more capacity becomes merchant oriented focusing in marginal cost economics , and transmission congestion persists , increased volatility will continue , especially in iso / pool type environments . prices will reflect primary fuel dynamics , especially the interplay between gas and oil . the case for lower prices will reflect an overbuild scenario beyond this year , coupled with slowing economic activity and low incidence of extreme weather events . how fast can generation be added and what returns should be expected ? the variability in development of greenfield capacity depends on time to permit at state or local levels . construction time is fairly constant . in general 18 months is reasonable time frame from concept to first fire . to the extent that power plants are project financed with minimum 30 equity , returns should be consistent with other comparable project financed opportunities available to fund managers . we do not expect any more fully debt financed facilities in the near term . can companies make major profits owning generation long term ? above average returns over time will reflect superior plant management skills and effective use of strategic market information . portfolio approach will aid in this case . if an oversupply situation occurs in the 2003 - 05 timeframe , significantly lower returns on capital could materialize . is this the time to sell generation ? because of recent market events in west , capacity has higher than historically observed values . depending on overbuild scenario this may be an attractive time to sell capacity to those still in queue or hoping to build in near term . recent pool experience shows that capacity owners still have significant market power how will supply demand balance change in various regions of country ? weather normalized demand growth fairly consistent at 2 - 3 % on average overtime . future dynamics depend on economic growth , which suggests more load on coastal and in tech - concentrated areas . short - term demand reflects weather dynamics ( year 2000 a non - event for eastern interconnect , opposite in the west ! ) . aggressive capacity growth suggested in nepool , ercot , ecar , main and spp over next two years . will natural gas continue to capture all the growth ? virtually all capacity due on line is gas fired , however , incremental supply growth could come from investments in existing coal and nuclear stack , which can be more economic . marketing ? growth business will appear as more interaction solicited from enduser , and rates can become more dynamic . too late for new entrants ? most states still do not have switching of energy service providers , so still time to enter . barriers to entry include capabilities in brand management , retail marketing , effective integration of risk management and billing ability . will only handful of customers be big winners ? to the extent economies of scale and aggregation opportunities exist , there will be success to larger players but not to exclusion of niche player existance . how diffentiated are the strategies ? to date marketing is focused on lower rates and giving an alternative to existing service provider . this will have to develop beyond that . how significant is the retail opp ? in markets where retail rates are high , order of magnitude limited to 10 ' s of dollars / mwh . however gives opportunity to trade around , similar to supply asset .

2	Subject: re : sale of napoleonville land louise , on monday , prior to my leaving for buffalo , i spoke with dave gorte and was informed that since the sale of the napoleonville land was greater than $ 2 . 5 mm , it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a dash . since the negotiations were quite contentious between reliant , texas brine and enron - we ( eva , lisa and myself ) had worked with mr . gorte to create multiple versions of the dash . it was not until wednesday afternoon that reliant was the chosen " victor . " in addition , since i felt you were apprised of the deal and mr . gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process , lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule . unfortunately , this meant wednesday afternoon around 4 pm , but we had been informed by tammi schoppe that you were available until 5 pm . even though the banks were closed , i had wanted to sign the executables on wednesday so reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend . it was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction . i will be flying back to houston today and will be landing around 5 pm . both eva rainer and lisa druzbik are in today and i am leaving instructions to ( hopefully ) close the deal today . julie gomez will be signing on my behalf - - for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to eva . my cell is 713 - 302 - 4187 . regards , jean - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : sun 11 / 25 / 2001 2 : 10 pm to : mrha , jean cc : lavorato , john ; gomez , julie a . ; rainer , eva ; nemec , gerald subject : re : sale of napoleonville land at 4 pm on wednesday liza arrived with the dash . it had not been circulated prior to that and there was no - one available to discuss the deal as eva was not in the office . please have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the dash in advance of when you want it signing . 4 pm on wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn ' t give enough time to complete a dash . louise - - - - - original message - - - - - from : mrha , jean sent : monday , november 19 , 2001 6 : 06 pm to : kitchen , louise cc : lavorato , john ; gomez , julie a . ; rainer , eva ; nemec , gerald subject : sale of napoleonville land louise , tomorrow , i am flying to buffalo , ny for thanksgiving with my father . as such , for the potential sale of the napoleonville land , julie gomez will sign on my behalf for lrci inc . after both appropriate commercial , accounting and legal parameters have been met . the status is as follows : texas brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 mm and has the opportunity to counter . texas brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $ 2 . 35 mm . reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the " act of sale " document . as such , gerald nemec ( my legal ) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups ( i . e . litigation and environmental ) . i am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving . however , this bidding " war " has the potential for ena to extract an even higher auction price . the approximate book value of the land is $ 1 . 4 mm . i can be reached via blackberry or cell ( 713 - 302 - 4187 ) . eva rainer , manager , is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions . regards , mrha

( ene ) from north american energy markets was proceeding in an orderly fashion , enron havoc broke loose friday morning . cleaning up the mess will be nearly unbearable for energy industry employees for a few weeks because enron was involved in so many trades . but industry workers don ' t expect electric reliability to be threatened or gas supplies to be disrupted . what ' s more , the free market ' s ability to resolve problems most efficiently and to keep infrastructure humming will shine . the lull after wednesday morning ' s collapse of dynegy inc . ' s ( dyn ) acquisition of enron was deceptive . on thursday afternoon , mirant ( mir ) told enron it would make no more power and gas deliveries to the company starting saturday , the first day of the new month . a couple of other companies followed suit by friday morning . enron in turn began to lose its ability to meet its obligations as a supplier , because it doesn ' t produce much electricity . to meet sales obligations , it buys from producers and other traders . the positive feedback system is expected to spiral upwards until early next week , when enron could be almost totally out of the energy market . to get an idea of how messy this all is , look at one troubled transaction thursday for saturday delivery of electricity to a utility . the utility bought power from sempra energy ( sre ) , which had bought it from el paso ( epg ) , which bought from dynegy ( dyn ) , which bought from pg 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron impact on gas sector not yet clear - aga officials 11 / 30 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 202 - 862 - 6647 ; bryan . lee @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones bankruptcy decision said unlikely before next week 11 / 30 / 2001 dow jones business news ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) embattled energy - trading concern enron corp . is still considering all of its options , including the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 , people close to the matter said . such a decision , however , won ' t occur before next week , these people said . some enron employees are being told not to expect any action over the weekend , these people said . the chapter 11 process is designed to hold a company ' s creditors at bay while it hammers out a plan to reduce debt . although people familiar with the situation insist an all - out liquidation - - known as a chapter 7 filing - - isn ' t in the cards , some industry observers continue to speculate that the beleaguered company may be forced to go that route . with its energy - trading business crippled by the downgrade wednesday of most of its debt to junk status and a buyout by dynegy inc . ( dyn ) called off later that day , enron ' s fortunes have been in a downward spiral . as of 4 p . m . est friday on the new york stock exchange , shares of enron ( ene ) dropped 10 cents , or 28 % , to 26 cents . the stock had traded above $ 90 a share last year , and , all told , equity shareholders have lost over $ 60 billion . enron ' s outstanding bonds trade at prices of around 15 cents on the dollar . the selloff in enron ' s bonds - - down from the upper 50 - cent range before wednesday ' s developments - - suggests bondholders don ' t expect much if any recovery on their investments . there is little doubt that any bankruptcy proceedings will be complex and time - consuming , given the nearly $ 62 billion in assets on enron ' s balance sheet , as of its last quarterly financial report . also , the bankruptcy court would have to wade through and untangle many items not listed on its balance sheet . those financing vehicles are what sparked the company ' s troubles last month . enron ' s liabilities are still a matter of debate . the company has an estimated $ 13 billion in debt on its balance sheet , and a further $ 7 billion in financings off the balance sheet . however , there may be other obligations lurking in connection with its investment partnerships . since the debt downgrade , enron ' s trading business appears damaged beyond repair . without a viable credit rating , the company no longer has access to the reams of cash it needs to run that business . underscoring enron ' s woes , the company told some of its trading partners on friday that it will default on some of its deliveries of wholesale electricity under contract for sunday and monday , people familiar with the situation said . some observers had expected enron to file for bankruptcy protection as early as this week . but the people close to the situation said the complex business structure is slowing the process . where the company would file is also a question : the houston - based company could file where it is headquartered , but it is incorporated in oregon , and many companies look to the favorable courts of delaware whenever possible . enron hired restructuring and bankruptcy specialist blackstone group late last week to advise it on corporate matters and to help restructure its debt . the company also is being advised by law firm weil gotshal & manges , a bankruptcy specialist . key supplier stops delivery mirant corp . ( mir ) stopped delivering all power and natural gas to enron sold under existing contracts world - wide , traders and people familiar with the situation said . the move brings enron ' s struggles in north america to a new level . until now , most companies had stopped making new trades with enron , but continued to deliver under their previously done deals . and enron has been delivering under its contracts in north america . through thursday , enron was able to get third parties to step in and buy from mirant and sell to enron . in one transaction , for power to be delivered saturday , silicon valley power stepped into the middle . silicon valley power , the municipal utility of santa clara , calif . , confirmed thursday that it had done so . " that transaction for saturday is based on a contractual obligation we made to enron in the past , when enron was on a positive trading position with us , " said silicon valley ' s marketing manager , larry owens . energy - market sources expect other companies to follow suit with mirant , and they don ' t expect enron will be able to find intervening third parties for much longer . companies have the legal right to suspend deliveries if they reasonably expect they won ' t get paid . to date , enron has paid its bills on time . saturday gas and power deliveries carry more risk than deals for delivery even friday , as enron won ' t have to pay for deliveries starting dec . 1 until late january . a spokesmen for enron wouldn ' t comment . " we don ' t discuss activities with individual counterparties , " spokesman eric thode said . layoffs begin in europe enron officials said friday the company will lay off all but a handful of its european employees . a few staff will be retained to wind up the remaining operations of enron in europe , which are now largely under the court - appointed administration of . a statement issued by said " approximately 1 , 100 redundancies have been made in the u . k . across the group , with 250 staff retained .

( ene ) . the likelihood that enron will file for what would be a messy bankruptcy is " sure to illustrate one of the fundamental differences between commercial banks and investment banks , " noted analysts van hesser and justin ziegler at credit suisse first boston in new york . the appetite of commercial banks for more exposure to an individual name than their investment banking rivals is evident in a breakdown of the direct loan exposures to enron , a list that ' s dominated by commercial banks . according to ratings agency fitch , j . p . morgan chase has $ 500 million in unsecured exposure and at least a further $ 400 million that is secured . citigroup ( c ) , is gauged at having $ 800 million in exposure with $ 500 secured and $ 300 million unsecured by fitch . and another leading commercial entity , bank of america corp ( bac ) , is believed to have $ 300 million in direct loan exposure as at sept . 30 , note csfb . extending loans to companies that can run into problems , " is definitely the risk in commercial banking , but such banks are well diversified and able to absorb these situations , " said ken worthington , director and equity analyst at cibc world markets in new york . however , in the case of j . p . morgan chase " which prides itself on passing credit risk off to others through various means , including loan syndications and hedging , this is a stunning figure , " said kathy shanley , bank and finance analyst at gimme credit , an independent credit research firm in new york . in recent years , commercial banks have sought to leverage their diversified structures by aggressively muscling into the territory of investment banks . they sought to underwrite corporate bond and stock issues - the traditional turf of investment banks - by offering commercial banking sweetners such as lines of credit and loans . investment banks do not enjoy the benefit of a substantial balance sheet and tend to focus on underwriting and generally don ' t provide loans . and while investment banks have been forced by competitive pressures to extend lending facilities - demonstrated by morgan stanley ' s credit facilities to lucent technologies - " they usually offload their balance sheet exposures in order to lower their risk profile , " said worthington . this in turn underlines the more selective approach that investment banks have to financial markets than their commercial banking cousins . while investment banks are not gun - shy of building risk exposures , the csfb analysts believe " they tend to build fewer and they tend to be more disciplined about it . " this helps explain why in respect to enron , csfb believes " broker exposures are relatively light . " the bank expects exposure to enron at goldman sachs group ( gs ) , and morgan stanley ( mwd ) " to be in the $ 50 to $ 100 million range , while other major securities houses such as bear stearns companies inc ( bsc ) , lehman brothers ( leh ) and merrill lynch & co . ( mer ) " should have exposures that are relatively immaterial . " but the carnage at enron has left some investment bankers looking better off than the gungho commercial banks who sought juicy m & a fees by providing creditlines to the company as it planned its ultimately doomed merger with dynegy inc . ( dyn ) . as citi and jpm face the prospect of a battle over the assets of enron in a bankruptcy filing , " goldman sachs sits on the sidelines with a cheshire cat grin , reminding investors it declined to extend a credit line to enron as a condition of signing on as a merger advisor , " noted gimme credit ' s shanley . the travails surrounding enron and the big commercial banks , " reads like a case study dreamed up by the securities industry association to illustrate why banks should never have been allowed in the investment banking business in the first place , " she said . although goldman and morgan stanley have " meaningful energy trading operations , " csfb believe that both banks are well versed in hedging and structuring collaterized trading agreements . such methods limit the potential for gaping losses associated with failure of a counterparty to trades previously transacted . worthington at cibc added , " what really drives the business of investment banking are relationships and talent . " but mired at the bottom of the investment banking cycle , many firms have been looking to combine their talented workforce with the attractive balance sheets of commercial banks in order to enhance their operation . they ' ve looked to the success of citigroup ' s vaunted one - stop shopping model , which combines banking services with the investment banking offerings of salomon smith barney . although fitch notes " the banking industry ' s stated exposures do not appear , in and of themselves , significant enough to have ratings implications , " the news from enron is perhaps a timely reminder that cultivating a big balance sheet also carries certain risks . that ' s not to say investment banking won ' t undergo further consolidation that involves finding large balance sheets . the search for profits and economies of scale from building a joint commercial and investment banking franchise are the stuff of many bankers ' dreams . indeed , many analysts believe merrill lynch michael . mackenzie @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron collapse could weigh heavy on some insurers by chad bray of dow jones newswires 11 / 30 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - the insurance industry didn ' t need enron corp . ' s ( ene ) problems , particularly when it comes to reinsurance prices . primary insurers could be on the hook for as much as $ 2 billion in claims against directors and officers policies , surety bonds and financial guarantees related to the houston energy trading firm , which , among its options , is considering seeking chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . some insurers also will likely take a hit in their investment portfolios if enron defaults on its bond payments . the loss would be material , but not devastating for the industry . however , amid the backdrop of the world trade center disaster , enron ' s impact could pressure some firms going forward , particularly if most of their enron risk was ceded to reinsurers . " this event is likely to exacerbate the ( reinsurance ) capacity shortfall in the market that already exists , making 2002 one of the more , if not the most , powerful pricing years in recent history , " said alice schroeder , a morgan stanley insurance analyst . reinsurance prices were rising prior to the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . rates are expected to rise dramatically in light of the events as reinsurers get a handle on how to insure this new risk in the u . s . aviation rates , for example , have already climbed 200 % to 300 % in some cases . reinsurers also are willing to take on less risk , forcing primary insurers to keep more of the coverage or write policies offering less coverage . chubb corp . ( cb ) , a warren , n . j . , insurer , said it was reviewing its surety bonds related to enron and could have a maximum net pretax exposure under outstanding surety bonds of about $ 220 million . the firm said its after - tax exposure is $ 143 million , or 82 cents a share . a company takes out a surety bond in the event it can ' t fulfill a contractual obligation . typically , surety bonds would pay out any monetary guarantees if a company was unable do so . surety bonds are often used to improve a firm ' s credit rating . the insurer was unable to estimate the actual amount , if any , that they may be required to pay or the timing of those payments because of contingencies , including the actions of others , possible judicial rulings or the amounts that chubb may recover under surety bond documents . no claims have yet been filed under the surety bonds . jay cohen , a merrill lynch analyst , said chubb ' s surety bond obligations in regards to enron generally guaranteed the delivery of natural gas to energy producers , such as utilities . each bond could have different defined events that would trigger a claim , such as a bankruptcy , cohen said . " the enron loss will likely be a very sizable one in the surety line , a line that was not particularly effected by the trade center attack , " cohen said . " the loss will likely exceed $ 1 billion and we note that the industry wrote surety premiums totaling $ 3 . 5 billion in 2000 . we would expect this loss to have an effect on insurers ' risk appetite pertaining to surety obligations . " cohen said chubb likely has reinsurance for its losses and that its gross exposure is " above the $ 220 million maximum net exposure . " ron frank , a salomon smith barney analyst , said , while the enron situation is clearly " unusual , " the loss should be viewed relative to chubb ' s overall financial condition , which is quite solid . he said chubb ' s historical profitability in surety is " very good even including enron . " frank noted the chubb announcement didn ' t address any other exposure to enron , such as directors and officers liability . " management did comment to us that if they saw another exposure material to earnings per share , it would have been released , " frank said . " we infer from this that reinsurance and reserves will meaningfully mitigate such exposures . " large surety writers include st . paul cos . ( spc ) , american international group ( aig ) , cna financial ( cna ) , act ltd . ( ace ) , safeco corp . ( safc ) and the travelers unit of citigroup inc . ( c ) . however , not all large writers of surety obligations necessarily have an exposure to enron . at the same time , a major enron loss could inhibit some traditional property - casualty insurers from writing financial guarantee - related risk in the future , said schroeder , the morgan stanley analyst . schroeder noted that could be a positive for traditional financial guarantors in terms of less competition , but could also be a concern . for example , ambac financial group inc . ( abk ) and mbia inc . ( mbi ) , both traditional financial guarantors , have been able to " wrap " lower levels of risk on certain collateralized debt obligation deals with traditional p & c insurers , while taking the higher , or less risk prone , layers for themselves . being conservative in nature , they might not be willing to take on the more risky layers in the future . - by chad bray , dow jones newswires , 201 - 938 - 5293 chad . bray @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . us physical gas prices end down ahead of weekend 11 / 30 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones john . edmiston @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron directors ' side deals raise eyebrows . 11 / 30 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 30 ( reuters ) - directors of enron corp . , already under fire for failing to identify and correct problems that brought the energy trading giant to the brink of collapse , had lucrative side deals with the company that drew added criticism from corporate governance experts on friday . the deals ranged from consulting jobs to purchases of goods and services from affiliated companies . they raised doubts about the board ' s independence from the senior managers they were supposed to supervise on behalf of the stockholders , the experts said . " directors who have side consulting arrangements are not considered , under governance guidelines , to have the necessary independence from management , " said charles elson , director of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware . in contrast to the murky off - balance - sheet financing deals that played a key role in enron ' s demise , the company made detailed disclosures of its deals with members of its board of directors in a proxy statement published earlier this year . the document shows that in addition to his supervisory duties as an enron director , john urquhart was paid $ 493 , 914 last year for providing consulting services to enron . " that ' s a huge amount of money . best practice is no consulting fees to any directors , " said nell minnow , an editor at business research group the corporate library , which does extensive work on corporate governance issues . another enron director , lord john wakeham , received $ 72 , 000 last year for advice on enron ' s european operations . enron director herbert winokur was affiliated with the privately owned national tank co . that made sales to enron worth $ 370 , 294 last year , the proxy statement said . the document also shows that enron paid $ 517 , 200 last year for travel services provided to enron employees . the travel agency business that provided the services is 50 percent - owned by sharon lay , sister of enron chairman and chief executive ken lay .

" the auditors - the big five auditing firms - have got to look at themselves and say , how can this sort of thing happen ? " said david hawkins , an accounting consultant with merrill lynch and a professor at harvard university . " the rules are there . have we lost our way , so to speak ? do we need a new compass direction ? " enron , once a wall street darling with a share price that hit more than $ 90 , started coming apart after it reported losses from transactions that were led by its former chief financial officer and kept off its balance sheet . experts said it failed to apply generally accepted accounting principles and failed to disclose sufficient information to explain its dealings . andersen , the accountancy firm that audited enron ' s books , said such judgments are premature . " the best idea is to gather information , as the securities and exchange commission and enron board are doing , and then decide what lessons we can learn , " andersen spokesman david tabolt said . " instant judgments often are based on presumptions . . . that often turn out later to be incorrect . " accounting 101 but the rules that enron appears to have violated are quite straightforward , according to some experts . for example , recording the note enron received in return for selling equity to its limited partnerships as an asset is contrary to an accounting rule that bans such treatment unless the note is to be paid off in a few days , hawkins said . ultimately , those transactions turned sour , causing a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and losses that contributed to a $ 1 billion third - quarter charge . " this is accounting 101 here , " said paul brown , chairman of the accounting department at new york university ' s stern school of business . " it may be that the way it was dressed up was so complicated that it was hard for the auditors to ferret it out but , then again , that ' s their job . " the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) , which sets accounting rules , said firms must disclose extensive information about related - party transactions . enron may well have violated the spirit of that law by inadequately explaining its transactions , the experts said . when enron began to unravel , analysts criticized andersen for failing to explain the firm ' s dealings in its financial statements . enron reported its transactions in cryptic footnotes that many said were almost incomprehensible . andersen has also come under fire for failing to consolidate those partnerships into enron ' s books , which would have given a truer picture of enron ' s debt . enron later restated its results to reflect those transactions in its books , cutting earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 , effectively admitting it made a mistake , but not before its credibility had been shattered . on thursday , harvey pitt , chairman of the sec , which is investigating enron and andersen , said that the agency is looking at whether accounting principles were applied " appropriately , " and what may need changing . patching up loopholes to be sure , critics have long called for better accounting rules , particularly those regarding the type of off - the - balance - sheet financing that enron engaged in . tim lucas , who heads a fasb task force on emerging issues , said fasb was trying to complete big projects on business combinations and asset retirement obligations this year , before tackling the issue . lucas said the enron saga may also hold some implications for rules on financial instruments such as derivatives and recording them at fair value . " we will certainly be aware of this ( enron situation ) and if it sheds some light on an area where we can improve the rules we will try and do that , " he said . " but it ' s not obvious to me yet that it does . " but apart from raising questions about andersen ' s role , the implications of enron ' s near collapse may well force the entire auditing community to do some serious soul searching to prevent future disasters .

" enron had an option to purchase a parcel of land in st . clair township to build a peaker plant to generate electricity during peak periods , " said caroline dicocco , the member of the provincial legislator for sarnia - lampton . " the feeling in the community is that this is not going to happen because of severe financial difficulties , " she said . enron , north america ' s largest energy trader , now on the verge of collapse , planned through enron canada corp . to build a 400 megawatt generating plant near sarnia , ontario . it recently renewed an option on the land in st . clair township and was seeking various regulatory approvals . however , enron ' s canadian president rob milnthorp told reuters earlier this year , that the firm had delayed construction of the plant until a clear date was set for the province to open up the market to competition . the company was not available for comment on friday . " we were aware that enron had considered a plant and those plans have been on hold for some time now , " said mike krizanc , a spokesman for ontario ' s energy ministry . " the latest events affecting the company have no impact on what ' s happening in ontario in terms of competition and supply that we ' re anticipating , " he said . ontario , canada ' s most populous province and the nation ' s industrial and economic heartland , is set to unveil plans within the next two months for the deregulated power market . the province has already pushed back its original november 2000 deadline by 18 months . earlier this year , it said it would open the market by may 2002 . although the planned enron plant will likely never be built , market experts said the company could sell what infrastructure and development it had completed . " that is potentially an attractive asset . but any time you ' re selling a half - built house , you know it ' s just not the best way to get value , " said tom adams , executive director at industry watchdog energy probe in toronto . meanwhile , ontario power generation , the province ' s biggest electricity producer , said in a release that its exposure to enron was less than c $ 100 , 000 and therefore it " does not anticipate any adverse earnings impact " related to its trading activities with the u . s . firm .

" although much attention has been focused on enron in relation to loan exposures , the energy sector , and the commodities markets , it is also a named source of credit risk in many credit derivatives transactions , " said nik khakee , director of standard & poor ' s structured finance derivatives group . " in addition , enron had an overall derivatives market strategy that included credit derivatives . thus enron is not only a source of credit risk in derivatives transactions , it is a source of risk to derivatives transactions as it could possibly cause termination events in swaps that enron has contracted , " mr . khakee continued . on a global basis , enron appears in 50 transactions as a reference entity or reference obligation in pooled credit derivative transactions , meaning that enron is a credit exposure . two counterparties transact a swap in which the default of enron , as defined by specified credit event language defined in the swap documentation , would lead to potential loss to one counterparty , the floating - rate payer . this loss is defined by a valuation process whereby a settlement value for the potential enron exposure is determined . this value can often be the result of a bidding process in the market where dealers are solicited . this bidding process is commonly referred to as cash settlement . alternatively , physical settlement may be selected as the settlement mechanism whereby an enron fixed income instrument is exchanged for the notional value of the enron exposure in the overall pool . these transactions total $ 79 billion in total notional amount . the potential enron exposure in the deals in aggregate totals $ 3 . 3 billion or 0 . 75 % of total notional exposure . it is important to note that these transactions are primarily investment grade credit derivative collateralized debt obligations in which credit support to rated noteholders typically averages 2 % - 4 % . therefore , a default of enron and low recovery on enron post - default would significantly erode this credit support . " standard & poor ' s is currently reviewing all transactions in which enron is a named reference entity for possible rating actions , " mr . khakee said . enron may also appear in this same type of credit derivative transaction but as part of a small pool , rather than a large pool of overall credit exposure . in this case , enron may potentially be the single reference source of credit risk in a credit derivative transaction , irrespective of the credit risk posed by the actual counterparty risk in these transactions ( which is not addressed in the estimated exposures identified above ) . enron appears as a reference credit in six transactions with potential total notional exposure to enron of $ 2 . 7 billion in these single - name risk or small basket credit derivative transactions . in addition , in december 2000 , enron began acting as the counterparty in swap transactions without also being the reference entity . as such , its counterparties are vulnerable to potential default by enron as counterparty , even if it is not a reference source of credit exposure in a transaction . in these transactions , any default by enron as counterparty under the swap contract would initiate a process whereby termination of the swap contract is possible . the nondefaulting counterparty would have the option to replace enron with a new counterparty in the swaps . this could be done on the whole swap notional amount of credit exposure or the portfolio could be carved up into pieces in order to distribute the risk across various counterparties . whether transferred to one counterparty or many , this process , called assignment , leads to a mark - to - market valuation . that mark is either in favor of enron or the counterparty enron faces . thus , after an enron default , the counterparty could be exposed to a liquidity risk because it would have to make a mark - to - market payment to enron . conversely , if enron has to make a mark - to market payment to the counterparty , the counterparty may not be receiving the payment , especially if insolvency proceedings commence . enron has secured ratings on three such credit derivative transactions in which a total notional amount of $ 3 billion of credit derivative exposure was traded . to give some perspective on this number , mr . khakee explained that standard & poor ' s credit derivatives analysts in new york who review pools of credit exposure have reviewed transactions with a total notional amount of $ 23 billion in the year to date . " the notional amount of $ 3 billion relative to enron represents a larger percentage of overall rated credit derivative transactions than would be expected of an entity that is not a traditional broker - dealer , investment bank , or insurer , " he said . / contact : nik khakee , + 1 - 212 - 438 - 2473 , or mary ryan , + 1 - 212 - 438 - 2090 , of standard & poor ' s / 16 : 54 est copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . scope of peer review of andersen audit practice to be expanded 11 / 30 / 2001 pr newswire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire ) chicago , nov . 30 / prnewswire / - - andersen today announced deloitte & touche will expand the scope of its peer review of andersen ' s us accounting and audit practice . the expanded procedures , which have been under consideration for over two weeks , will include , among other things , review procedures in andersen ' s houston office . andersen asked for additional work in light of financial reporting issues at enron corp . deloitte & touche had independently determined it wanted to conduct additional procedures .

there are several issues that cloud an enterprise valuation of enron . first and foremost is the uncertain value remaining in enron ' s wholesale trading business . approximately 75 % of enron ' s total 2000 income before interest , minority interests and taxes was generated by the wholesale services segment , which consists primarily of the energy trading business . based on recent refusals of enron ' s energy trading partners to accept the company as a counter - party and exacerbated by implementation of trading restrictions on the company by the new york mercantile exchange , fitch believes significant doubt has been cast upon enron ' s ability to continue to operate this business at its previous scale . further , previous valuations of bankrupt trading businesses have been quite low . therefore , fitch believes it would be prudent to assign a very conservative valuation to this segment in a recovery analysis . secondly , due to the ongoing securities and exchange commission investigation of enron ' s accounting , and previous restatements of earnings , there exists uncertainty over the accuracy of historical earnings reports . finally , enron ' s retail energy segment is closely integrated with the company ' s wholesale operations for energy supply . if the wholesale operations remain shutdown , the future cash flow generation ability of the retail segment may be materially impaired . how will the value of enron ' s assets be allocated in a bankruptcy ? fitch has conducted a preliminary analysis of recovery prospects for various creditor classes . enron ' s pipeline business has historically been a steady source of cash flow generation . a market comparable method of valuation for the transportation segment results in strong recovery prospects for secured creditors at northern natural and transwestern . fitch estimates there would be roughly $ 1 billion of residual value from the pipelines following the satisfaction of their secured and unsecured claims and dynegy ' s claim . as part of the merger agreement with enron , dynegy injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in exchange for preferred stock in enron ' s largest pipeline , northern natural gas , which can be converted into ownership of the pipeline . dynegy has exercised this option . it is noted that as part of its investment in the preferred stock , dynegy negotiated the right to block a bankruptcy filing at this subsidiary . enron has various other assets that could be monetized to satisfy unsecured creditor claims . enron has an agreement to sell its portland general electric subsidiary for anticipated net proceeds of about $ 1 . 8 billion in cash or cash equivalents in 2002 . in addition , enron has contracted to sell $ 800 million of merchant assets which is expected to close before year end , subject to execution risks including regulatory and transfer risks . the net proceeds that could be realized from cash on hand , inventories , and various other monetizable assets are difficult to estimate . moreover , the full extent to which the company ' s assets have been pledged is uncertain . the outstanding amount of senior unsecured debt is currently estimated to be about $ 11 billion , excluding possible liabilities arising from trust structures such as marlin and osprey . additionally , other general unsecured claims in a bankruptcy would include customer deposits , minority interests , project and structured finance make whole obligations , as well as an unknown amount of amount of exposure to is shareholders , employees and others relating to the spate of recent litigation against enron . the amount of these other general unsecured claims can not be determined at this time . despite the fluidity of the situation , fitch ' s preliminary view is that unsecured creditors would realize recoveries in the 20 - 40 % range . this opinion considers the deterioration in the value of the wholesale trading business , the pledge of flagship assets to secured creditors , the uncertain cashflow generation prospects of the retail segment in light of the wholesale business situation , the opaque and uncertain accounting and off balance sheet liability issues , and other unexpected liabilities . will enron be able to continue to operate as a going concern or seek to liquidate assets ? enron would require a sizable debtor in possession facility to fund ongoing operations and induce counter - parties to resume business with enron . fitch believes it is uncertain whether enron has adequate unencumbered or over - collateralized assets to obtain a dip large enough to enable the resumption of wholesale operations . what is the situation for secured creditors to marlin water trust ii and osprey trust ? the ratings of marlin ' s $ 915 million senior secured notes and osprey ' s $ 2 . 4 billion senior secured notes rely on support of enron . a liquidation of the underlying assets is the primary source of repayment . a shortfall in liquidation proceeds would become a claim against enron , which may be subject to subordination to the claims of other creditors in a bankruptcy . contact : fitch , new york sharon bonelli , 212 / 908 - 0581 or robert grossman , 212 / 908 - 0535 or ralph pellecchia , 212 / 908 - 0586 or glen grablesky , 212 / 908 - 0577 or james jockle ( media relations ) , 212 / 908 - 0547 15 : 56 est november 30 , 2001 copyright ?

2	Subject: hurricane warning derivatives folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products . it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure : pro - hurricane anti - hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u . s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure . thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas . while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility , when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves . as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline . on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers . please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project . thanks , charlie

2	Subject: alternative work schedule status as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future . i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we know are needed in our work hours . here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting : schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss at the next meeting . each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with hr on schedules being used at enron the following is what i heard at the first meeting : our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels . cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a " just do it " attitude . there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk changes . late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job . there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule . feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m looking forward to our next meeting - bob

2	Subject: new prototype sheet for epe and epmi communication good afternoon fred , after our call , a better solution presented itself to me . the best quality of information regarding prescheduled deals done by epe would come from epe directly to enron ' s real time group . please see the following prototype sheet that i have made , i have checked with bill and greg , and they both agree that this format will give real time the hourly shapes that they need , with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr . this sheet could be created and sent after the e - tag deadline has passed , giving epe ' s group ample time to get all the information that they need before real time would ever need it . since e - tag is a fact of life for all of us now , we would benefit the most by building e - tag into our solution . by comparing the e - tags that epe recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties , epe has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves . enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see , without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers . having epe generate this abbreviated sheet for epmi real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have . please take a look at this sheet , and see how you like it . real time would also gain benefit by having the name and phone number of the person designated to be " on call " for that day . i welcome any questions or comments : cara semperger west power scheduling supervisor 503 / 464 - 3814
