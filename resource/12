2	Subject: el paso and coastal announce their merged structure and office locations el paso , coastal consolidate pipeline staff el paso energy and coastal corp . announced plans yesterday to relocate more than 1 , 200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the el paso natural gas headquarters in el paso , tx , and the anr pipeline headquarters in detroit , mi , once their merger is approved by the ftc , which is expected sometime in the fourth quarter . no final decision on staff reductions has been made , an el paso spokeswoman said . the companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline systems into three organizations , collectively led by john w . somerhalder ii . under the consolidation plan , the combined company ' s nationwide pipeline system will be consolidated into three regional operations . the western region will consist of el paso natural gas company and colorado interstate gas company and will be headquartered in colorado springs , co . the eastern region will consist of anr pipeline and tennessee gas pipeline and will be headquartered in houston . southern natural will make up the southeastern region headquartered in birmingham , al . john somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the el paso pipeline group . patricia a . shelton , currently president of el paso natural gas , will lead the consolidated western region pipelines . jay holm , currently responsible for el paso ' s australian pipeline assets , will return to the united states to become ceo of the eastern region . reporting to holm as presidents of tennessee and anr will be stephen c . beasley and james j . cleary , respectively . the southeastern region will be led by james c . yardley , who will continue as president of southern . shelton , holm , and james yardley will report to somerhalder . " this consolidation will create the most effective organization for el paso ' s pipeline system , " said el paso ceo william a . wise . " our upcoming merger with coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation , border to border and coast to coast . this consolidation represents a highly disciplined approach to managing this system , allowing us to strike a proper balance between customer focus and operational efficiency . it also facilitates a company - to - company exchange of expertise across our system and speeds the merging of separate company cultures . " while the companies will be organizationally merged , the five pipeline systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names . though many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters , field functions and related activities will remain in their current locations . in addition , some employees will remain in the el paso and detroit locations . the company will ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation . those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages . most moves will occur during the first half of next year , and the majority of the plan is expected to be implemented by mid - 2001 . the companies announced their $ 16 billion polling - of - interests transaction in january ( see daily gpi , jan . 19 ) . the merger is expected to be accretive to el paso ' s earnings per share ( eps ) immediately and add more than 5 % to eps in both 2001 and 2002 , wise said at the time of the merger announcement . overall , the two companies expect $ 200 million in cost savings . by comparison , the el paso - sonat merger created more than $ 100 million in savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs . the combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist of over 58 , 000 miles of pipeline , by far the most of any pipeline company in north america . the system will transport more than 20 bcf / d of gas through existing pipeline infrastructure , but will have sole or part ownership in three other new or proposed major pipelines , including alliance , gulfstream and independence . the company also will be the second largest gatherer of natural gas in the united states and the third largest u . s . producer of gas . - -

2	Subject: re : backtesting for different percentiles vlady , i enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots ( you saw them before ) . the following table shows what was the percentage of the days when pnl fell below var 95 , var 90 , var 85 . these results are based on the real ng forward prices from 1 / 1 / 99 to 6 / 7 / 00 for 2 different portfolios : - portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to ng - price - prc portfolio positions on 6 / 6 / 00 , - portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to storage - prc positions on 5 / 25 / 00 . portfolio 1 var 95 var 90 var 85 implied vols 2 . 93 4 . 11 5 . 57 historical vols with decay  1 7 . 62 12 . 02 15 . 54 historical vols withdecay  0 . 97 6 . 75 12 . 02 15 . 54 historical vols withdecay  0 . 94 6 . 45 12 . 02 15 . 54 portfolio 2 var 95 var 90 var 85 implied vols 4 . 1 6 . 74 9 . 97 historical vols with decay  1 7 . 04 11 . 14 15 . 84 historical vols withdecay  0 . 97 6 . 74 10 . 56 16 . 13 historical vols withdecay  0 . 94 7 . 04 11 . 14 15 . 84 this shows that when we have more observations ( columns corresponding to var 90 and var 85 ) compared to the column corresponding to var 95 the frequency of curve shift being lower than var becomes closer to the theoretical value ( 5 % , 10 % and 15 % ) . the numbers in the column " var 85 " are very close to 15 % . this is the argument in favor of using historical vols . and also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment . also notice : the numbers in column " var 95 " are higher than 5 % and this is an indication of fat tails . let me know if you have any questions . tanya .

" this reader will know that in 2005 , only lavender sweet peas produced flowers . that " fact " will disappear unless it ' s in my journal . i ' m going to press flowers between the pages , a snapshot of my garden , maybe a bit of poetry , a photograph of my welsh terrier , buttons . i will add garden - variety quotes to stir me and thoughts i cannot do without . what will i write ? what will you write ? i ' m a simple person and will scribble , " today i ' ve started this garden journal . with paper and pen i will tell myself about my garden . " it ' s my hope you write about the breezes on your face , the soil on your fingers and the sunshine on your back , among other miracles . i pray you ' ll take up gardening with pen in hand . - - eva shaw , ph . d . eva is a woman who lives to write , garden and mentor . she teaches writing online , speaks nationally on grief and recovery and is the author of the just released , what to do when a loved one dies : a practical and compassionate guide for dealing with death on life ' s terms . from our mailbag : ( in response to last week ' s story , only winners ) dear heartwarmers : two great stories . keep them coming . - - pat dear heartwarmers : thank you for another wonderful heartwarmer . hope she realizes this was one kid who had an imagination ! blessings . - - jene dear heartwarmers : hey , pat and his invisible baseball is such an amazingly beautiful story . there ' s something very basic in our human nature that makes us connect in an invisible way . i only wish politicians wouldn ' t spoil it all with their ridiculous fake rhetoric spewing " divide and rule " policies . sorry , i couldn ' t help that after the bomb blasting news from everywhere , not just london . - - chhanda dear heartwarmers : i have a daughter with down ' s syndrome and loud noises bother her also . at our church there is a section where a group of down ' s sit . it is interesting to note that when the preaching or music gets louder , they begin to cover up their ears . - - robert dear heartwarmers : although i haven ' t expressed my opinion about one of your stories for quite some time - - even though there have been many good ones - - i feel compelled to comment on this one . as a person with several disabilities , including blindness , i couldn ' t agree more that when we show friendship and compassion , everybody wins . if ours was a world in which more of those inclusive and receptive attitudes were shown , perhaps it would be a kinder , gentler world . thanks for an excellent story which mirrored the best that we can be when we put our minds , hearts , and souls to it . - - terri do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

' 04 additional shares to be retired : 1 . 3 million per company press release estimated shares in float : 7 million completed biosphere process systems now in operation : 26 potential size of market ( us / foreign ) : too large to calculate ( unlimited ) solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . record backlog of sales for leth : during the past year , over 20 biosphere process systems have been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over $ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these contractual agreements include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the future once the initial order has been completed . the options vary from hundreds to thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves through this low - float , emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $ 7 million per biosphere process system ! financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales : the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that leth trading at around $ 2 . 00 , now has accessible capital equivalent to $ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor in that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding ! political power fosters rapid global expansion : leth has captured the profit - making attention of both us and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources . this has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from dr . albert reynolds , chairman of leth , who is also the former prime minister of ireland . dr . reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . uncommon value for a company of this caliber : we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere , the impressive backlog of over $ 100 million in sales orders , and the company ' s very solid financial position . we view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company ' s own sales records . we anticipate the continuation of strong positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first unit is rolled - out in new orleans that will ignite leth shares . leth carries our highest rating for short - term trading profits followed by robust long - term capital gains for aggressive portfolios looking for homerun performance . maximum financial stock alert ( mfsa ) cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mfsa . mfsa recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mfsa is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mfsa is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mfsa has received forty thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements .

year period in the case of involuntary termination . following are the facts material to this issue : 1 . fran mays was represented to hpl employees as the authoritative source of information regarding enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of hpl . 2 . even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist , the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative enron source . it is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation . 3 . in an instance of a divestiture , merger , or other change of control of a company , in my personal experience , there can be , and often are , modifications and exceptions to benefit plans . usually this is done in the interest of fairness to employees affected . in my own case in the sale of hpl , there was an exception made since i did not retire from enron , but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired . this allowed me to be vested in some stock options that i would have lost . the monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since i only had about 25 unvested share options , but it is a precedent . 4 . i submitted to fran mays , through my supervisor , a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period . 5 . the only response to the specific written question that i submitted was contained in a general q & a format response from fran mays which contains an unequivocal , direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of hpl is three years . 6 . there was a disclaimer in the q & a document that referenced plan documents . a disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity , but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct , clear , unequivocal statement of fact . there is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact . i , among a number of hpl employees who are former enron employees , made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the q & a that we had three years to exercise all options . the one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences . although i recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options , in my case the combined impact could be very significant . from aep ' s perspective , enron employees who agreed to stay with hpl and move to aep with the sale added a great deal of value to the hpl acquisition . it seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited enron . i am requesting that the time to exercise the original all - employee options be extended to three years . this would make this stock option plan consistent with other enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to hpl employees that the period would be three years . this change would allow hpl employees who acted as loyal enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted enron to feel that they were treated fairly by enron . l . b . echterhoff lbechterhoff @ aep . com 832 - 668 - 1204 from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 31 / 2001 01 : 18 pm to : lal echterhoff / hou / ect @ ect cc : brian redmond / hou / ect @ enron subject : re : stock option questions lal , thanks for your comments . i have verified with the corporate compensation group and legal and unfortunately enron is not able to remedy this situation . the plan document provisions supercede the q & a . fran - - - - - original message - - - - - from : echterhoff , lal sent : thursday , may 31 , 2001 10 : 53 am to : mayes , fran l . cc : brian redmond / hou / ect @ enron subject : re : stock option questions your position that the general disclaimer on the q & a of march 8 negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable . if the answer to this specific question , shown below , was that various plans had various periods for exercise , then that should have been the answer to the question , not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years . i , and i am sure many others , made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity . i would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant . i use the term " expiration date " to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with enron . with regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed , anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger , spin off or sale of a company . special provisions were made to exclude hpl employees from the new all employee stock option plan , special provisions were made to provide a 5 % payment to hpl employees in lieu of the new stock option plan , special provisions were made to consider hpl employees over the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and i feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees . lal echterhoff from march 8 , 2001 , q & a : " 1 . with the transfer to aep , will my termination be listed as involuntary so that i can exercise my vested options ? yes , your transfer to aep will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from enron . 2 . what is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options ? the period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination , retirement , death or disability is three ( 3 ) years . " . from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 30 / 2001 02 : 14 pm subject : stock option questions we have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options . the q & a dated march 8 , 2001 stated three years as the exercise date for options . however , on page 1 of the document , a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program . if you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration , not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document , this is correct and follows the provision of the plan document . some employees have options granted under a different stock option plan and that plan carries a three year term of expiration . please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under . additionally , the document was intended to provide general information only . page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case there were any errors made in the document . additionally , we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review . enron provides the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document . i apologize for any confusion this may have caused , however , the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which enron determines the termination date . please call me if you need to discuss your options , however , understand that i cannot speak with you regarding other employees ' compensation / options .

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

2	Subject: commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo . ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up . additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus . forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis . directors and management dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company . aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation . dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri . viaspace overview viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce . viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems . viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories . the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk . viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate . in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power . viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries -

2	Subject: vector announces a one - month delay until december 1 note : the market reaction is interesting . one can surmise that quite a bit of the gas that was contracted for on vector is firm utility gas . the run up in chicago may be temporary until alternate arrangements are completed . vector delay confirms market ' s suspicions future shippers on the new chicago - to - dawn vector pipeline had their fears confirmed tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start - up date for the project , which was scheduled for nov . 1 to coincide with the start - up of the long - awaited alliance pipeline , would be delayed until dec . 1 . vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline , which - - - when completed - - - would provide initial takeaway for about 700 mmcf / d of the 1 . 3 bcf / d of western canadian gas that will be shipped to the chicago market by alliance . alliance is due to begin operations on oct . 31 . the announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million - dollar question : " where will that [ alliance ] gas go ? " in the meantime . alliance officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and ldcs serving the chicago hub that could pick up the slack between oct . 31 and dec . 1 . alliance ' s jack crawford downplayed the impact of the vector start - up delay on alliance . " we don ' t think [ there will be ] much effect at all . we have been working closely with vector . our connection with them , if it ' s not ready , is very close . we also have five other connections with other [ existing ] pipelines and ldcs " in chicago . many shippers " understand [ that with ] a startup the magnitude of ours [ alliance ] and vector ' s , there are likely to be some bumps at beginning . " immediate market reaction to the news was somewhat unexpected . the chicago basis for november widened from a plus 9 . 5 - 10 to plus 11 - 12 tuesday following vector ' s announcement . that is contradictory to what you would think would occur , said a chicago trader for a large marketing company . " i was offering index - plus gas today betting on the chance that will come off by the time bidweek rolls around , " he said . the effect on the market wasn ' t as profound as some would have thought , agreed another trader . " in fact , chicago prices actually strengthened on the news . you would think that with the excess gas on the market starting nov 1 , the basis would have come off . the only thing i can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the chicago market on nov . 1 as well . " meanwhile dawn prices , which one would have expected to strengthen following the news , did so , as november basis widened from low 30 s to plus 36 yesterday following the announcement , a michigan trader said . the vector pipeline would transport much of the alliance gas from the market hub in chicago to the hub at dawn , on , as well as provide access to markets and storage in the upper midwest . the line eventually will carry 1 bcf / d , but its initial start - up delivery capacity will be 700 mmcf / d . the pipeline is slated to serve key markets in ontario , quebec , and the u . s . midwest and northeast . ~ vector shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market tuesday , although many already had suspected the pipeline wouldn ' t be able to adhere to its scheduled start - up date . at an ldc forum in chicago a few weeks ago , a spokesman for vector insisted the pipeline was on schedule , but then sources said he showed pictures of parts of the pipeline underwater . " folks who were there knew what that meant . " presently , more than 90 % of the vector line has been installed and progress on the springville compressor station is on schedule , according to the company . the dec . 1 start - up date includes adequate time for any further weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs necessary , it said , adding vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in late october to complete the commissioning of facilities . sponsors of vector include calgary - based enbridge inc . with a 45 % interest ; westcoast energy inc . of vancouver , bc , with a 30 % interest ; and detroit - based mcn energy group inc . with a 25 % interest .

competition is not to blame for california ' s problems ; and basic economic principles of supply , demand , and prices affect market outcomes . section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurred beginning in may 2000 . section 3 , the heart of this paper , offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry . this section makes several points : * maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads . * ensure that enough infrastructure ( transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity ) is in place and planned to meet growing loads , maintain reliability , connect new generators to the grid , support large regional markets , and provide fuel to power plants . * encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic - pricing and voluntary - load - reduction programs ( i . e . , couple retail and wholesale markets ) . * create honest retail competition : avoid standard - offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors . * encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks . * create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy , ancillary services , and transmission congestion . * monitor and minimize horizontal market power ( generation ) and vertical market power ( combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission ) . ultimately , competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices , better align consumer prices with producer costs , improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation , maintain or improve reliability , and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options . but , this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated . it is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern , high - tech society ; electricity is our most flexible fuel , providing light , heat , motive power , and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment . also , electricity truly is a real - time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time . although the problems that have occurred in california are substantial and worrisome , regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long - term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short - term problems that may occur . they also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state . finally , competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated ; in particular , it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices . if states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services , we should all benefit . consumers will enjoy lower prices , they will have many more choices of energy services and price - risk tradeoffs , reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict , and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers . eric eric hirst consulting in electric - industry restructuring 106 capital circle oak ridge , tn 37830 * 865 - 482 - 5470 ( phone & fax ) * eric @ ehirst . com http : / / www . ehirst . com

2	Subject: re : eprm article chris , this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments . 1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the classification based on 3 categories : a . variance / covariance method b . historical simulation c . monte carlo simulation . delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument . 2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio . the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion ) that may involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the same model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) . the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you the references from home ) . 3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices , behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) . 4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem . this process may be a source of a big error . 5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments ) . please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) . vince " chris strickland " on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm please respond to " chris strickland " to : cc : subject : eprm article dear vince , ? d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin is after something by the end of this week . ? best regards . ? chris . ? - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc

( nyse : ene ) stock sustained further heavy losses on october 19 as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years . the energy giant ' s stock was off $ 3 . 32 or 11 . 45 percent at $ 25 . 68 per share at mid - day trade on oct . 19 , making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million . as of early morning trading on oct . 22 , enron shares were priced at $ 21 . 99 , a reflection of new developments ( including a new securities and exchange inquiry ) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors . analysis : enron ' s first financial report since the departure of former ceo jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company , which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory . while skilling cited personal reasons for his departure , many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enron ' s share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role . at the time of skilling ' s departure , enron ' s stock had tumbled to a 52 - week low . however , based on the new 3 q report , it now appears that enron ' s downward turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the company ' s top spot . in essence , enron ' s financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales . it appears that enron is learning a costly lesson - namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company ' s innovation , especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised . the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron , as a good number of unresolved issues and a new securities and exchange commission ( sec ) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company . let ' s first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the third quarter . as noted , as a whole the company reported $ 638 million in losses , after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges associated with several of its non - core businesses . when we break down the losses , it becomes clear that enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses : water , broadband and the retail power market . specifically , enron reported $ 287 million in charges from azurix , its water and wastewater business ; $ 180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations ( including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts ) ; and $ 544 million in what the company is calling " investment losses . " evidently , about half of the $ 544 - million figure is related to enron ' s investment in newpower company , the retail electricity and natural - gas provider that enron launched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm . enron owns 45 percent of newpower . in addition , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent , although lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002 . however , it is important to note that enron ' s 3 q recurring net income ( before the write - offs ) did increase 35 percent to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a diluted share , and revenue in the quarter rose to $ 47 . 6 billion from $ 30 billion in 3 q 2000 . the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting . as one of the leading investors in the company , enron drove newpower ' s aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales , despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the united states . newpower went public last year at an opening price of $ 21 , and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price . however , the company ' s stock has experienced a devastating drop in value , and is currently priced at $ 1 . 25 . newpower is not scheduled to release its own 3 q financial statement until early november , but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future . specifically , newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3 q loss of $ 65 million to $ 70 million , or $ 1 . 12 to $ 1 . 20 a share . third - quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $ 60 million to $ 65 million that the company had forecast in august . in analyzing newpower ' s 2 q financial losses ( see issuealert from 8 / 8 / 01 at www . scientech . com / rci ) , i argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the united states . on the positive side , newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts , most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from aes corp . and dte energy . these purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for newpower , and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states . however , the bad news for newpower is that its losses continue to widen , apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates . this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better , and the company ' s stock has continued to drop as a result . in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes , newpower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp . and several of its subsidiaries . the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries through jan . 4 , 2002 . with the lowered financial obligations that it must make to enron , newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset - based financing . however , from enron ' s perspective , the losses associated with newpower ( and , by the same token , the losses in water and broadband ) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price . the message is clear : the businesses that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole . further , what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enron ' s part has not translated into measurable profits , and consequently wall street has reacted by sending enron ' s stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago . the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all unique , but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from what was a successful core business . further , they are similar in that enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth . the problem with enron ' s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber - optic lines , which has prevented the demand for the division ' s services from materializing as anticipated . the problem with azurix , which has been losing money since its formation in 1998 , is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies anticipated . in addition to these problem areas , enron also faces challenges related to its investments in india ( where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government ) and california ( from which enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales ) . in addition to the losses outlined in the 3 q report , there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week . first , the sec has requested that enron provide information regarding " certain related party transactions . " not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry . however , it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of enron ' s chief financial officer andrew fastow , who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from enron . ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the sec ' s request . in a separate development , several mutual funds ( including aim constellation that once held large positions in enron ) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company , which has further weakened enron ' s stock value . portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about enron ' s ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader . the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses . thus , lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company ' s energy and gas - pipeline business are still strong . further , lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to " clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses . " nevertheless , the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort , and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well . thus , several questions remain at this juncture . are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading ? or , will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002 ? moving forward , will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably ? only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at enron , which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change . an archive list of previous issuealerts is available at www . scientech . com we encourage our readers to contact us with their comments . we look forward to hearing from you . nancy spring reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day . your company can schedule a sponsorship of issuealert by contacting jane pelz . advertising opportunities are also available on our website . our staff is comprised of leading energy experts with diverse backgrounds in utility generation , transmission & distribution , retail markets , new technologies , i / t , renewable energy , regulatory affairs , community relations and international issues . contact consulting @ scientech . com or call nancy spring at 1 - 505 - 244 - 7613 . scientech is pleased to provide you with your free , daily issuealert . let us know if we can help you with in - depth analyses or any other scientech information products . if you would like to refer a colleague to receive our free , daily issuealerts , please reply to this e - mail and include their full name and e - mail address or register directly on our site . if you no longer wish to receive this daily e - mail , and you are currently a registered subscriber to issuealert via scientech ' s website , please visit to unsubscribe . otherwise , please send an e - mail to to issuealert , with " delete ia subscription " in the subject line . scientech ' s issuealerts ( sm ) are compiled based on the independent analysis of scientech consultants . the opinions expressed in scientech ' s issuealerts are not intended to predict financial performance of companies discussed , or to be the basis for investment decisions of any kind . scientech ' s sole purpose in publishing its issuealerts is to offer an independent perspective regarding the key events occurring in the energy industry , based on its long - standing reputation as an expert on energy issues . copyright 2001 . scientech , inc . all rights reserved .

2	Subject: linear programming software purchase vince , i ' d like to purchase some copies of the xpress lp solver for the gas storage optimization model . we have previously discussed the purchase of cplex , but after trialing both systems , have found some worthwhile advantages with xpress . if others find planner / cplex best suited to their application , i see no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths , and it is likely that i would use planner / cplex myself on some future project if we were to have both systems available . xpress is particularly suited to my application because it handles special ordered sets . this is a very efficient way of representing the storage ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information provided by the set , rather than just using binary integer variables to represent the ratchets . planner is a c + + interface for cplex . it has some significant limitations , and does not permit access to all cplex features . dash optimization have made the following offer : all software purchases made by enron this year will be at 30 % off the list price - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of licenses to obtain this discount . 90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase . the emosl utility will be provided at no cost . the xbsl system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few weeks time . for the gas storage optimization model , i would like to purchase : one development license , hyper version , with modeller , primal / dual simplex , mip search , dlls , emosl and xbsl when available . list price $ 10 , 000 discounted price $ 7 , 000 two run time licenses for above , list price total $ 8 , 000 discounted price $ 5 , 600 total cost $ 12 , 600 i ' ve used the usually security request system to set the purchase process going , should you agree to this . tom .

' i did so . the staircase was dimly lighted by a single gas - jet at the top of the second flight . i managed to reach the landing without disaster and entered by an open door into the lighted square room of the tower . dampier came forward in gown and slippers to receive me , giving me the greeting that i wished , and if i had held a thought that it might more fitly have been accorded me at the front door the first look at him dispelled any sense of his inhospitality . he was not the same . hardly past middle age , he had gone grey and had acquired a pronounced stoop . his figure was thin and angular , his face deeply lined , his complexion dead - white , without a touch of colour . his eyes , unnaturally , glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny . mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm of the unreal without renouncing his residence in the partly surveyed and charted region of what we are pleased to call certitude . the night of my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the deserted streets , or , lifted by irregular gusts of wind , was hurled against the houses with incredible fury . with no small difficulty my cabman found the right place , away out toward the ocean beach , in a sparsely populated suburb . the dwelling , a rather ugly one , apparently , stood in the centre of its grounds , which as nearly as i could make out in the gloom were destitute of either flowers or grass . three or four trees , writhing and moaning in the torment of the tempest , appeared to be trying to escape from their dismal environment and take the chance of finding a better one out at sea . the house was a two - story brick structure with a tower , a story higher , at one corner . in a window of that was the only visible light . something in the appearance of the place made me shudder , a performance that may have been assisted by a rill of rainwater down my back as i scuttled to cover in the doorway . in answer to my note apprising him of my wish to call , dampier had written , ' don ' t ring - open the door and come up .

2	Subject: strictly private . gooday , with warm heart my friend , i send you my greetings , and i hope this letter meets you in good time . it will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally . however , i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction , which i propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity . i have kept it to myself for a long time , and now i need to act , as time is not on my side . i want you to open - heartedly read through and give me your most needed support . i got your address from an internet directory , in my search for a contact . i apologize if this is not acceptable to you . the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance . my name is donald phiri , the farm supervisor and personal assistant to mr . david stevens , a very popular and rich farmer from macheke , zimbabwe . my master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of april 2001 , due to the land dispute and political situation in my country , as a result of my master ' s financial support for the mdc ( movement for democratic change ) , the main opposition party to president mugabe ' s party , zimbabwe african national union patriotic front ( zanu - pf ) . for more information on my master ' s murder , you may check the amnesty international country report on zimbabwe for the year 2001 . when the pressure on white farmers started in zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by president mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers , my master forsaw the danger ahead , he then closed his major bank accounts , and together , we went to johannesburg , south africa to deposit the sum of $ 14 . 5 million ( fourten million , five hundred thousand usdollars ) , in a private security company , for safety . this money was deposited in a box in my name , as my master was being secretive with his name , as the south african government of thambo mbeki is in support of president mugabe ' s actions . the box is labeled as gemstones . my master had planned to use this money for the purchase of lands , new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in botswana . he has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from europe . my master is divorced , and his wife valerie , and only child , diana have relocated to bradford , ! en ! gland for 9 years now . i am currently in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum . i have now decided to transfer my master ' s money into an account for security and safety reasons . this is why i am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left . you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you . if you accept to assist me , all i want you to do for me , is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the netherlands , and then we will transfer the money into an account . you may open a new account for this purpose . i have applied to the security company to transfer the box from south africa to their branch here , which they have done . to legally process the claim of the box , i will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative , and deliver the box to you . i have with me , the certificate used to deposit the box , which we will need for claiming the box . for valuable assistance , i am offering you 10 % ( $ 1 , 450 , 000 ) of the total money . i have also set aside 1 % ( $ 145 , 000 ) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction , and 4 % ( $ 580 , 000 ) , will be given to charity in my master ' s name i will give 25 % ( $ 3 , 625 , 000 ) to valerie and diana , after my share of the money has been transfered back to me . when they grant my asylum application , my share of the money ( 85 % ) , will be transfered back to me , into an account i will solely own . i also intend to start up a business then . if you have knowledge of farming business in your country , or other areas of possible business investment that i may be interested in , please inform me , so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being . please , i want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction . i look forward to your reply and co - operation , and i am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you . yours sincerely , donald phiri . - - - - this sf . net email is sponsored by : thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven . http : / / thinkgeek . com / sf spamassassin - sightings mailing list

2	Subject: fw : a positive note about enron . move over carly fiorina . . . : - ) - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jaffry , adil sent : thursday , october 04 , 2001 9 : 32 am to : jafry , rahil subject : fw : a positive note about enron . fyi . . . from cbs . marketwatch . com , online at : attacks highlight enron ' s value by lisa sanders 3 : 02 am et oct 4 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - in the wake of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by enron . the attacks highlighted the houston company ' s strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty . through its trading centers , the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil , natural gas , and electricity markets , as well as other commodities . although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks , its trading activity resumed the next day . by coming back online so fast , " we made the decision to provide some stability in the market , " said vance meyer , an enron spokesman . " the customers really appreciated the fact that we were there , providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market . " in a financial sense , enron ( ene ) didn ' t suffer , meyer said . but employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken . nick humber , who worked for enron ' s wind energy business , died aboard a los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center . " we have offices in washington and new york , and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way , " meyer said " we also had traders who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the planes hit . " the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks " may have increased volatility , a boon to the group , " said bob christensen , analyst at fac / equities . companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business , he said . managing risk is what enron does best , market players say . and that strength should help the company going forward as u . s . businesses try to recover from the impact of september 11 . through its enrononline platform , the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about $ 3 billion a day , meyer said . " the world at large has become more risk averse , and enron , which is in the business of risk mitigation , should benefit from that , " said glen hilton , senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new power fund , which has a stake in enron . " with energy risk and prices potentially going up , they ' ll be the first number on many cfos ' speed dial . " other companies do what enron does , but it ' s the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading , measured in terms of volume . duke energy ( duk ) is the next - largest competitor , but it has one - third of enron ' s volume . high profile departure that ' s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year , though it grew 151 percent on the top line in 2000 . other problems notwithstanding , including its money - losing broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland general electric , enron ' s largest black eye came in mid - august when jeffrey skilling , chief executive since february , resigned abruptly . john hammerschmidt , senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy and power technology fund , said he " freaked out " when skilling left and managers immediately divested the turner large - cap portfolios of enron holdings . despite its status as a growth player , turner had re - entered the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation . at the time , enron was trading in the mid to high $ 40 s . " this is a premier company and a premier industry , " he said , adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock . one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing , hammerschmidt said . that has not materialized . whatever the problems were , hammerschmidt said , he felt them to be manageable . when skilling walked out , hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true . " in our experience , when somebody in power leaves for no reason , there ' s uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous , " he said . management continuity now he ' s looking to get back in . enron , he said , works in both down and up markets . " enron ' s earnings are more solid today than they ' ve ever been . . . and they ' re valuable because we ' re becoming a digital economy , " he said . " we need high - quality power , and local power plants have trouble providing reliability . enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system . " of course there ' s still the issue about trusting management . after skilling left , enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief operating officer and mark frevert to vice chairman . " you cannot expect ( whalley and frevert ) to articulate the enron vision the way jeffrey did , " christensen said . " they may grow into it . " on the upside , skilling predecessor ken lay , who wall street credits with building enron into a powerhouse , is back at the helm , and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place . " we have a great deal of confidence in mr . ken lay as he was the original architect of ene ' s ( and for that matter the entire industry ' s ) tremendous transformation for the past decade , " merrill lynch stated in a research report the day after skilling left enron . what ' s more : " ken lay has promised more transparency at enron , more insight into how the company makes money , which will help , " hilton said . " trying to forecast enron ' s earnings is difficult . " christensen said that a " lack of data and clarity in regard " to enron ' s wholesale operations has been an issue in the past . enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its third - quarter results on october 16 . ultimately , only time will assuage investors ' concerns . but with the prospects that enron has , the stock is a deal right now , hammerschmidt said . " i don ' t know what gets people back , but buy enron at $ 25 , and in a year , you ' re making money , " he said . " i can see the stock getting back to $ 50 in a blink . "

' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb . the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue " notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power " was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said . according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : " the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . " while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a " protest payment " of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . " we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh " , a senior mseb official said . " we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members " , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept " protest payments " anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the " purported protest or reservation " . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . " the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , " a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s " enabling resolution " did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . " this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting " , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . " it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , " a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , " bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of " interested party " . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . " we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , " he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as " unfortunate " . " we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision " , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb . " if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , " the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a " protest payment " of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . " we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , " power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . " we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , " a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . " we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . " the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi . " there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , " power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs " we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . " in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . " mid day ' dpc may not wind up ' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , " bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . " in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , " we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . " deshmukh had earlier said , " we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . " enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , " i am not going to give any comment . " mid day , april 27 , 2001 enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . " we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , " the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government " is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . " mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company . " renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , " deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , 2001 ' enron ' s on ! ' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . " enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , " he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , " let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . " when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . " it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , " he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .

2	Subject: fw : bingaman draft on transparency - - amendment ideas louise - - lisa yoho suggested i forward the attached e - mail from yesterday on a conversation linda robertson and i had on the transparency issue . my apologies for not including you on the original distribution list , as i should have done . your comments are most welcome . john shelk - - - - - original message - - - - - from : shelk , john sent : tuesday , september 11 , 2001 9 : 51 am to : robertson , linda ; long , chris ; shapiro , richard ; yoho , lisa ; briggs , tom ; nicolay , christi l . ; steffes , james d . subject : bingaman draft on transparency - - amendment ideas last night , linda and i spent a fairly long time with leon lowery , chairman bingaman ' s chief electricity advisor , to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market - based rate language - - while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard . we made progress on transparency , less so on market - based rates . on transparency , leon understands our concerns . in a nutshell , he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction - specific , trade - specific information . we persuaded leon that was the impact of the initial language , although he initially said details would be left to ferc . we persuaded him that if any data is to be provided , it must be only in aggregate form . we also impressed on him that if , as he said , the intent is to leave details to ferc - - then more of the details should be left to ferc , not set by statute . leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections . this will make it easier for leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff . ( sam fowler , th chief counsel , is a drafting stickler ) . others should obviously weigh in and review this , but to facilitate internal comments ( we need to get back to leon today ) , here is my take on what he has in mind . under new sec . 218 ( b ) ( to be added to the fpa by bill sec . 413 ) ( pg . 13 ) , under " information required " we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows : ( 2 ) each broker , exchange , or other market - making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce . the effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy . by leaving it as aggregate statistical information , this should give ferc maximum flexibility to permit indexes , etc . as to the " timely basis " of information release ( subsection ( c ) ) , the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the internet after the end of the trading day . if we can restrict this to aggregate data , question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily . that suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want , i think . here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give ferc more leeway : " ( c ) timely basis - - the commission shall require the information required under subsection ( b ) to be posted on the internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate . the change is to add " appropriate " so that ferc can consider other than whether posting is practicable . the use of " appropriate " is what came to mind - - perhaps there is some other word or phrase like " consistent with . . . " or " promote competition " or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability . there should be some valid purpose established before data is released . i would argue that the ( d ) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure , not when disclosure is appropriate . please let me have your thoughts , although the tragedy in nyc and dc now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the hill . will provide a further report on market - based rates . in sum , leon was not as sympathetic on this issue , but asked for our ideas and further arguments . we sense leon personally feels strongly about moving the fpa to some linkage to competitive markets . his argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets . we pushed that penalizing us is not the answer - - nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down . leon clearly does not intend this language to punish enron - - but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets .

2	Subject: update - reporting to work next week many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week , especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today . we want to encourage you to come to work . we continue to consider every option available to us as a company ; and unfortunately , restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options . your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process . i still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy . but you should be aware that , in general , the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $ 4 , 650 per employee . i want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition , we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices . additionally , enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing . for enron , where our value is directly tied to our employees , making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority . we are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue . of course , until we finalize those business decisions , we cannot make that determination . i know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you . i can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so . while terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment , we hope to do what we can to assist them . we will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search . we have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in enron alumni . we will share more information on these efforts soon . i appreciate your continued patience and cooperation . ken

2	Subject: el paso status on cornhusker sale joe henry and i met with andrew kidd and david field of el paso today to discuss the timeline and status for the sale of cornhusker . additional topics included the incremental land / option agreement between the project comapny and tenaska ( a potential $ 7 . 5 mm deduct from our sales proceeds ) and the requirement of el paso to purchase the " black box " equity to finish their due diligence on the equity and the prior " facilitation process . " schedule el paso will be meeting with ralph eads tomorrow afternoon to present a final valuation and risk summary . after this they will forward over their marked psa and would like to meet thursday / friday to finish the agreement . after finishing the agreement , the deal will go to el paso for capital review board and bod meeting . we will then have only the " black box " purchase / put timing and hsr to go for closing / funding . value david and andrew pointed out their aggressive discount rate a number of times and point to increasing insurance costs on power facilities as the " 90 % " driver of a likely decrease in purchase price ( our insurance folks can attest to the increase ) . el paso estimates an 8 to 9 mm dollar price reduction from these increased costs . the latest increase from our insurance was substantial too , but not this high . we are doing a quick variance on our numbers vs the " sent " model and will match insurance parties at el paso and enron today / tomorrow . el paso doesn ' t have any interest in the incremental land / option ( nor do we ) , so ponderosa is going to sell the project company with the option to tenaska intact . this outcome is the lowest legal risk for enron and almost a " no - cost " alternative which maximises our net cash received from the purchase . el paso will assume the siemens westinghouse long term service agreement risk and has not asked for an indemnification on the matter . hopefully the psa will match . future updates i will send an update to this same distribution list as frequency demands . if any of the recipients believe i should include additional people , please email the names back to me . thanks , chuck ward

" downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral . enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence , according to investment bankers . in its third - quarter results report last month , enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write - offs related to soured investments . it also announced an extra $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in 2006 , bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a week ago , were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on monday , a strategist said . enron shares were up 40 cents , or 3 . 55 percent , at $ 11 . 67 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . the shares have been in free - fall for two weeks . copyright ? 2000 dow jones maintains rtg watch negative 11 / 05 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 5 , 2001 - - fitch downgrades enron ' s outstanding securities as follows : senior unsecured debt to ` bbb - ' from ` bbb + ' ; subordinated debt to ` bb ` from ` bbb ' ; and preferred stock to ` b + ' from ` bbb - ` . enron ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ` f 3 ' from ` f 2 ' . the senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries , northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , are lowered to ` bbb - ' from ` a - ` . all the above securities remain on rating watch negative status . fitch would consider further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt , if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration , or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non - core businesses and investments exceed present estimations . today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence . this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments , which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off - balance sheet vehicles . enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment , ultimately recognizing the values of the company ' s core businesses . in october , enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper , leaving it approximately $ 1 billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities . in addition , the company is in the process of executing a new $ 1 billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern . unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage . while its current cash position appears adequate , securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development . a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses . clearly , these actions , if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company ' s credit profile . however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries . an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commission ' s ( sec ) investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships . the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict . the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric co . ( pge ) to northwest natural gas co . the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests . however , the transaction is not expected to close for another year . enron ' s core businesses have continued to generate strong , predictable performance and have significant value . prospectively , operations at enron ' s domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron . also , pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year . combined , the pipelines and pge generate nearly 25 % of ebitda . wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns . specifically , commodity marketing and trading activities , which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations , have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins . however , if enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility , these businesses would be harmed . contact : fitch , new york ralph pellecchia , 212 / 908 - 0586 robert grossman , 212 / 908 - 0535 hugh welton , 212 / 908 - 0746 11 : 13 est november 5 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron sr . unsecured debt cut to triple - b - minus by fitch 11 / 05 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - fitch downgraded enron corp .

" the cut continues the aggressive moves on the part of the fed , and it comes on top of a huge move by the treasury . the treasury did more in one fell swoop last week than the fed ' s done all year .

the major oem ' s scope is limited . the critical commercial control path is not normally the boiler and steam turbine . it is many times through the material handling systems . - the facility footprint has a tremendous impact on cost . - it is very difficult to remove the utility influences on cost and the oem ' s and the contractors who do coal plants are significantly influenced by utility concepts . - many cost capital cost disasters with these plants have root causes in the inability of owner ' s teams to control themselves . due to the fact that there are many components , the engineer ' s and operator ' s desire to " optimize " gets you into trouble in the control and timing of scope . in addition , the large number of components makes it difficult to " visualize " the project thus a large number of changes are incurred with the development of the actual design . - industry experience indicates capital cost success in a coal plant is achieved by a bottom up or detail scope management process not a top down or functional specification which will work on a cgt installation . the bottom up approach requires definition up front which is costly . the options to secure the best price and practice on coal plants are limited and in general have a basic issue in that the options that are lower cost on the front end are potentially high cost in execution and vice versa . the contractors / oem ' s that we can turn to for a coal plant are limited . a full liability wrap makes the list even smaller . due to the risk , a wrap is going to be very expensive for a coal plant and without a doubt will dramatically raise the capital cost due to designed in over capacity and redundancy . in a cgt this is never an issue as it is internal to the power island pricing . as mentioned below bechtel has the most experience in the world on coal fired plants . the have developed the " powerline " series of standard design plants . this standard plant concept has been very successful for bechtel in reducing the cost of process plants which face the same issues as coal fired power plants . supposedly bechtel has engineered utility preferences out of these plants . they have 5 plants in their offering . on pulverized coal they offer 2 x 350 mw and 2 x 700 mw although they yet have to get their first 2 x 700 mw order . on circulating fluidized bed they offer a 2 x 250 mw . they have developed but not sold a 350 mw igcc based on their tennessee eastman model . their order of magnitude costs look competitive , but care is cautioned due reasons stated of needing to carefully examine the scope on coal plants . despite all this planning and effort as the note below indicates , bechtel had significant cost and schedule problems on their red hills cfb " powerline " 2 x 250 mw project in mississippi for tractebel . the bechtel team on this project was among their best . the problem is publicized as a lack of construction labor . the large number of components drives the labor requirements up dramatically for the same investment in a cgt . bechtel has filed suit against tractebel for force majeure claiming the lack of labor is a force majeure event . that is certainly a unique concept . it is clear bechtel holds tractebel responsible for some of its problems . i do feel bechtel ' s open shop company , becon , is weak . historically starkeville , mississippi has been a good labor market . in summary , even bechtel can get in trouble on a coal plant . alstom is solid oem for many plant components , but i would have concerns about their engineering and construction skills to manage a coal plant . also we will have little means to control the cost as development is mostly theirs . recently we faced a similar issue on the bahamas lng terminal . in that case we have decided to partially fund two companies in a design contest . in addition to a clear competitive drive , we will have claim to all developments in both designs and this concept gives us the bottoms up detail definition with which to control the scope . the cost is considered reasonable by management in light of the risk . our future is your success . keith dodson -

2	Subject: re : tom halliburton dear all : a few words about tom . he is a power engineer type who has previously worked at northwestern us and new zealand utilities on various projects including asset planning and hydro scheduling . he was hired by ei structuring to oversee modeling efforts using sddp , henwood , etc . because of the recent implosion at ei apache , tom ' s group has effectively evaporated , and thus he is looking for a new home . he has some finance background from having to do asset evaluation for utility rate filings . he has almost no options experience . he seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of or problems . clearly the most obvious fit is with my group , but the idea is for you all to see if tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects . and , as usual , the personality fit is the other aspect to examine . this is meant to be casual . if the consensus is positive , then i will explore the formalities of such a transfer . thanks , grant .

" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at her startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

2	Subject: immediate reply needed dear sir , i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account . there were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand united state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned . consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course . modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms . our assurance is that your role is risk free . to accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary . once more i want you to understand that having put in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my country , i am averse to having my image and career dented . this matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves . please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction , if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction . i want to assure you that this business proposal is 100 % risk free as we have done our homework properly . i quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are still in government service , which we intend to retire from in full honor . kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year . thank you and god bless . dr james alabi

" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called " structured finance arrangement . " the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : " in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . " according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : " at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . " the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been " in the money " , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .

2	Subject: the storm arrives - cera alert update from cera on pricing and rest of the season . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced . * pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through 2001 and probably into 2002 . during the past two summers , high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall us storage injections to reach barely 1 . 6 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) . if normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter , 2 . 2 tcf of injections - which would be nearly impossible to achieve - would be required during 2001 if inventories are to recover to 2 . 7 tcf at peak . if weather this winter is merely normal from mid - december through march , going into winter next year the united states will have considerably less gas in storage . reaching even the 2 , 362 bcf level , according to cera estimates ( see table 1 ) , would require an additional 275 bcf of injections next year , and that alone would prove challenging . price - the cold weather path the weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above cera ' s cold weather path for this winter ( see table 2 ) . storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through mid - december proves accurate , and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense . for these reasons cera ' s outlook for prices for january and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold weather path . prices could take an even higher path , particularly if colder - than - normal weather endures beyond mid - december or returns on a sustained basis in january or february . several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will begin to enter the market during the winter , but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over . such factors include a building us supply capability , growing imports , softening oil prices ( allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends ) , and potentially weakening economic growth . although the influence of these factors will increase , it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer . demand - the difficult next round of switching with gas prices hitting new record highs , cera expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market . because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since may , however , the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred . even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate ( approximately $ 7 . 23 per mmbtu in new york ) , switching from gas to distillate requires changes in long - standing consumer habit , will occur only over time , and is likely limited in volume . significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself . there are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets : * additional switching to resid in industrial boilers . the next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector , through additional fuel switching to resid ( and to some extent to distillate ) . these markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume . cera estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts ( less than 0 . 5 bcf per day ) in switching to resid , given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * investment in restoring switching capability . as premiums move far beyond this level , industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial short - term levels . however , such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets . cera estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year , switching to resid could eventually reach as high as 1 . 3 bcf per day . there is already some movement here ; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings , energy prices have already begun to receive management attention . * switching to distillate . us department of energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly 1 . 3 bcf per day to distillate in the short term . this switch would represent additional distillate demand of over 200 , 000 barrels per day ( bd ) in a us market of 3 . 8 million barrels . this marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price , and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation . in addition , the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a long - term solution to tight markets . * shutting down industrial plants . also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock . the major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries , and , not surprisingly given the tight margins available , manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand . however , in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk . whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the gulf coast is relatively readily replaced by imports , substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast ( because of transportation logistics ) and for facilities whose production is linked to value - added fertilizer products . hence , cera still estimates that even with nonexistent margins , substantial ammonia production would continue , with additional losses of perhaps 200 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed . extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of north american methanol capacity , putting at risk another 100 to 200 mmcf per day of gas demand for that sector . switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals , paper , and refining sectors in the south and the food products sector in the midwest . continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the south central region . for process users , even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term . energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users , and a physical changeover would be time - intensive and elemental in its impact on end - use product quality . the northeast - cold weather operations begin all of the northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed , or are highly likely to need to impose , transportation restrictions of various types . the most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services ( secondary and interruptible type services ) , which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines . other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match . even hourly flow orders have also been implemented . these actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected . whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions , the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up . the spot market , primarily made up of nonfirm customers , has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area , as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week . the result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to henry hub . at one point , gas for next - day delivery to new york traded near $ 24 . 00 per mmbtu delivered , although the average price was closer to $ 14 . 20 . these high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas . although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal , cera now expects basis into the new york citygate to average $ 1 . 31 per mmbtu for december and $ 1 . 36 per mmbtu for january . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated tables . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , " shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future " in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www . cera . com / ceraweek / this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

- sb 18 xx ( burton ) , sb 78 xx ( polanco ) , ab 82 xx ( keeley ) and ab 83 xx ( wright ) - - are still " in play " legislatively this evening , even though the governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly and senate to stay in session ( despite the scheduled summer break ) until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature : * sb 78 xx ( polanco ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 passed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes . the originally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original memorandum of understanding ( " mou " ) negotiated between governor davis and southern california edison ( " edison " ) . it was recently amended to reflect senator sher ' s proposed " plan b " of the mou - - a version of the mou opposed by edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy . it was heard in the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on wednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote . reconsideration was granted , however , and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2 noes on thursday morning . the authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause , changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws , placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399 . 26 ( which insulated edison international from certain claims ) during the thursday hearing . sb 78 xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations committee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes . * sb 18 xx ( burton ) department of water resources : electricity : bond financing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes and 2 noes , making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower , cheaper rate than allotted in ab lx ( keeley ) assuming the assembly concurs and the bill is signed by governor davis . the bill also prohibits any additional charges such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and requires certain " sunshine " provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the dwr . we understand that j . p . morgan and lehman brothers - - the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering - - have advised the governor ' s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons , so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed . the bill was heard by the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10 ayes and 0 noes vote . it next must be heard in the assembly . * ab 82 xx ( keeley ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 passed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote . it was then heard later the same evening by the assembly appropriations committee , where it was passed on a 11 ayes and 6 noes vote . this is the " compromise " bill we have been discussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred keeley . the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report , with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full assembly , possibly later this evening . the current version of the bill provides for limited direct access , state purchase of edison ' s transmission lines for $ 2 . 4 billion , a minimum 30 percent " haircut " for the major generators and a " trust " to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option . * ab 83 xx ( wright ) alternative electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx ( by assembly member bill campbell ) in the assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening , and then passed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes . it next must be heard by the assembly appropriations committee , barring a rule waiver . no such committee hearing is scheduled at this time . co - authored by assembly members rod wright , keith richman , joe canciamilla and bill campbell , the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection , among other things . other energy - related developments this week include : * sb 84 xx ( burton ) state energy resources conservation and development commission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and sent to the assembly . this bill provides $ 10 million from the state general fund to the california energy commission ( " cec " ) to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals . the grant program will be administered by the cec , in consultation with local governments , and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup system . it next must be heard in the assembly . * the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board for an independent slate of directors on wednesday , the ferc announced on friday . despite a dec 15 , 2000 , ferc order requiring the appointment of an independent governing board for the iso , the state has refused to follow the order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board . supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the state ' s domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities . * sb 85 xx ( burton ) electrical restructuring : rates passed out of the full senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes . this bill bars the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the pre - 10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on march 31 , 2002 . it next must be heard in the assembly . * the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies ' trading practices . the resolution - - sr 14 - - passed out with 28 ayes and 6 noes . * the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted unanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas - based reliant energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents . despite reliant ' s having handed over 10 , 000 documents , the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality of reliant ' s documents . the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas . mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents . the contempt citation against reliant will be presented to the full senate , and then immediately sent to the rules committee for another hearing before the full senate acts , dunn said . * the state ' s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from $ 8 . 9 billion to $ 6 . 1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment in the state ' s figure on wednesday . although the state continues to argue that the $ 8 . 9 billion figure is correct , ferc judge curtis wagner called the figure " baseless " and criticized the california delegation for " not negotiating in good faith " during the recent settlement discussions . the new amount , $ 6 . 1 billion , does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers - - two entities that do not fall under the purview of the iso , px or the state dwr - - as well as applies ferc price controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales from october 2 onward . * ab 28 xx ( migden ) electrical restructuring : oversight board : iso passed out of the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on tuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes . it was amended by the author in committee to " double - join " it to sb 39 xx ( see below ) . this amendment " ties " the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx , unless the double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature , assuming the bill gets to the governor . * sb 39 xx ( speier ) public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly energy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes . reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author . given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee , ab 28 xx is effectively " dead " as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28 xx above . ) best regards , tom mcmorrow and mike martinez > -

2	Subject: california update 4 / 23 / 01 executive summary ? ferc considers price caps in the west ? davis / socal ed mou subject to legislative revisions ( we still stand by our early reports that the socal / davis transmission deal will most likely fail and that socal will follow pg & e into bankruptcy court ) ferc mitigates price spikes in the west ferc chairman hebert has placed a rto west proposal onto the agenda for this week ' s meeting . the proposal would " mitigate " price surges by requiring generating companies to sell power into california and other western states during stage 3 emergencies ( when there is less than 1 % surplus electricity in the grid ) and cap the price generators could charge during these highest states of emergency . 1 ) the ferc proposal would not set price caps for any other time than stage 3 emergencies 2 ) it would expire after a year 3 ) it would set the top reference rate at " cost plus " based on the cost to produce electricity by the most inefficient producer ferc is also looking at initiatives that would encourage the agriculture industry to possibly sell their power and natural gas contracts instead of using them to produce their products . although this proposal has not been formally approved or voted on at this time , the chairman ' s control over ferc ' s agenda is absolute and nothing gets on the agenda he does not want to consider . thus , if it stays on the agenda through meeting time , the odds of it passing are quite high if the meeting avoids total breakdown into hard - headed chaos . the key has been commissioner breathitt . the two recently nominated commissioners have not yet been approved by the senate and so cannot vote this week . thus any change in breathitt ' s position definitively tips the balance of power in ferc . davis & socal . mou not a done deal according to sources , the first legislative alteration to the davis / socal mou will involve removing the dedicated rate component necessary to repay socal ' s creditors . this point only highlights the senates ' indecision on how to deal with paying off generators . solutions currently range from seizing assets to seeking legal relief for corporate price gouging and sources indicate that the qfs are still likely to file involuntary bankruptcy against socal upon the senate ' s first official sign of unwillingness to work with creditors .

2	Subject: judicial judgements - child support bgs  you for your interest ! judgment courses offers an extensive training course in " how to collect moneyjudgments " if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote ' s from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : " i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on " after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : " i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now " after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated " i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out " marshal in area code 407 states to us " i feel bad , you only charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months " > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1 - 2 ` 8 ` 1 - 5 ` 0 ` 0 - 4 ` 0 ` 1 ` 8 . we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to 10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + this ad is produced and sent out by : uas to be e r a s e d from our mailing list please email us at smiley 82 @ 168 city . com with " e r a s e " in the sub - line or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a + + + + + + { % rand % } , , , , , , , , , , to 48 6 - 03 c 29 p my heart and my soul are lifted to you . i offer my life to you everything i ' ve been through use it for your glory .

" breakthrough " products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons . another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors . significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today . vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade . another analogy is the flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business . in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the " flashlight battery " - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each . vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east . intellectual property protected with patents vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources . vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc . for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office . " fabless " business model enables cost - effective growth fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips , then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well -

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( " gccc " ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the " act " ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words " plan , " " confident that , " " believe , " " scheduled , " " expect , " or " intend to , " and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 5 o we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . oo we feel this is our best pick since december of 20 o 4 ! ! please watch this one trade monday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains " forward looking statements " within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be " forward looking statements .

2	Subject: alliance may test the system up to 1 . 5 bcf / d in next two weeks strong demand holds load factors high despite alliance the introduction of the 1 . 325 bcf / d alliance pipeline into the north american gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western canada than expected , according to representatives of transcanada pipelines , pg & e gas transmission and alliance . extremely strong gas demand in the pacific northwest , california and in the midwest has produced continued high load factors on transcanada and pg & e gt - nw despite the presence of their huge new rival for western canadian supply . " the contract picture changed significantly on [ transcanada ] since the first of november and primarily at our empress , ab , delivery point into the transcanada mainline from the alberta pipe , but actual physical gas flows [ at about 6 bcf / d ] have not changed correspondingly , " said klaus exner , director of pipeline system operations at transcanada . " the big picture overview that i would give you is that demand is very high in the pacific northwest and california and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of alberta , through british columbia and into the pg & e systems . that hasn ' t let up at all and we don ' t foresee that letting up . " pg & e gas transmission spokeswoman sandra mcdonough said pg & e gt - nw has been running full at 2 . 6 bcf / d for some time and is delivering 900 mmcf / d to non - california load in the pacific northwest . " we ' re turning back demand right now . every power plant in this region is running full tilt . tuscarora [ gas transmission ] , the nevada pipeline , is full . our northwest deliveries are fixed . we ' re delivering as much as we can deliver right now . " transcanada ' s other major export route out of the western canadian sedimentary basin is the foothills and northern border route into the midwest . it also continues to operate at high load factors . " we didn ' t see a huge drop - off in physical flows post nov . 1 . we ' ve seen the it volumes come up considerably , " said exner . " the one thing that has changed is the volatility of the flows . customers are making frequent intraday nomination changes and we ' re seeing more up and down and day - to - day variations , according to the weather and the markets , than we would have when we had a higher firm contract level . the fluctuations are driven purely by the price differential between aeco and the dawn hub in ontario , which indicates whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not . " alliance pipeline spokesman jack crawford said the system has been running flat out at about 1 . 325 bcf / d since the valves were opened for commercial service dec . 1 . he also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase flows on the system . it has been estimated that alliance could increase gas flows to 1 . 5 bcf / d with existing compression . the additional capacity would be divided up among existing shippers , crawford said . " we haven ' t cranked up the system above the contract capacity yet . we probably won ' t do that for a couple weeks until we get things ironed out . frankly though , i ' m not sure chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the pacific northwest and california .

2	Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether the market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it . modeling details : the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel forward prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in january or september . using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the start - up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last two stand for ) are taken into consideration . with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit , then sums it up across all units . the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16 hours to run for about 200 units . after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make the model more flexible , say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet ) . assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology is ok , though it does not capture most of the optionality . my concerns are : whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more details before making any conclusion . 100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i don ' t see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again , if enron ' s buying the model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ? how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the associate who initiated all these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why the model horizon is one year . we can either oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them . or redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going to use the output ) . but in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we do it ? as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up delay into consideration . it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run 10 , 000 simulations for one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and incorporate seasonality into it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that when using forward - forward vol simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation using forward vol is about 2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since most of the time - cost occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes , i hope the full model ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main task will be interfacing , i . e . , getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need most help if i am to do it . please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle cisneros today . p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message below ) . best , alex - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by alex huang / corp / enron on 01 / 05 / 2001 08 : 58 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff m gray 01 / 04 / 2001 to : gary . hickerson @ enron . com , michael . w . bradley @ enron . com , michelle . d . cisneros @ enron . com , jaime . gualy @ enron . com cc : alex . huang @ enron . com , kskinner @ ftenergy . com , cseiple @ ftenergy . com subject : fw : project timeline ken and i worked up the following timeline and refined the trading methodology a bit this morning . we also met with alex huang from vince ' s group , and explained the model and coding tasks . ken and alex have arranged to speak by phone on monday , and meanwhile alex is coordinating within the research group . alex will oversee a programmer within his group , while interfacing regularly with us . 1 / 4 kickoff 1 / 11 complete spreadsheet , table , and database structures ( rdi ) . 1 / 17 complete software coding for the pricemaker component of the model ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) . 1 / 22 complete software coding for the dispatch portion of the model ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) . 1 / 22 complete financial trader " user " interface , within the access environment ( rdi ) . 1 / 22 complete collection and delivery of unverified generating - unit data from rdi databases ( rdi ) . begin verification process ( rdi ) . 1 / 29 complete all charts and reports accessible from the user interface ( rdi ) . 1 / 29 complete compilation of consensus ebitda forecasts for all operations other than merchant generation ( enron financial trading ) . 2 / 9 complete code testing ( enron research ) . 2 / 9 deliver verified and quality - checked generating - unit data ( rdi ) . 2 / 9 complete the model , begin testing the trading methodology , and train users . 2 / 16 finish training , testing , and final qc . jeff

2	Subject: juvenile diabetes foundation fundraising it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday , november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for this year ' s fundraising efforts . as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself . even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die . enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise $ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the walk this year is " knock out diabetes " and we would like to have you join us for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it . if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week . thank you very much for your support . mike mcconnell steering committee members : blanca bollom x 66091 rachel feldt x 57629 deb gebhardt x 39606 cathy phillips x 36898 john walt x 35379 debbie yates x 35305

- a conservative legal foundation said it will file a lawsuit tomorrow to void long - term contracts california signed with power generators , claiming they put an unfair burden on taxpayers . the united states justice foundation intends to sue in sacramento county superior court , said richard d . ackerman , lead counsel on the case for the group . the usjf wants a court to terminate the long - term power contracts and require money already paid to the generators to be returned to the state . the usjf proposes a class action to represent california taxpayers and alleges violations of the state ' s business and open - meeting laws . ackerman said his group may need to forge new law to succeed in the case . ` ` you ' re gonna have some serious legal battles that may go to the appeals level in this case , ' ' ackerman said . california officials last spring signed about $ 43 billion in long - term power contracts after two investor - owned utilities became insolvent . governor gray davis has said the contracts were needed to bring stability to california ' s energy market . since then , the cost of power has dropped , leaving california with contracts to buy electricity above spot - market prices . enron corp . , southern california edison company , pacific gas & electric company , green mountain energy , san diego gas & electric company , reliant energy company , pacificorp power marketing , inc . , alliance colton llc , and calpine energy company have electricity contracts with the state , according to a usjf press release . ` conservative voice ' the usjf said it sent a letter to california officials giving them notice of its intent to sue . the group , which calls itself ` ` your conservative voice in the courts ' ' on its web site , is supported by individual donations , ackerman said . the group has rallied against civil unions for homosexuals and mandatory student fees the group claimed were illegal taxes on parents and in favor of prayer in schools and resumption of u . s . assignations of foreign political figures , according to its web site . the california department of water resources , the agency buying power on behalf of some utilities , was unaware of the lawsuit and therefore couldn ' t comment , spokesman oscar hidalgo said . a spokesman for davis wasn ' t immediately available for comment . enron to meet with lenders on merger , possible yield increase 2001 -

' s shares fell as much as 28 percent , to their lowest level in more than a decade , amid reports that the no . 1 energy trader is struggling to find investors to help it out of a cash crunch . shares of enron fell 63 cents , or 6 . 5 percent , to $ 9 . 04 in late trading . the shares dropped to $ 7 earlier . at yesterday ' s close , they had fallen 88 percent this year . ` ` their only real access ( to cash ) now is through the bank market , ' ' said todd shipman , a standard & poor ' s director who covers enron . an equity infusion ` ` is what we still think would be an important part of stabilizing the situation . ' ' the shares pared some of today ' s losses after people familiar with the situation said enron is discussing a merger with rival dynegy inc . both companies are based in houston . dynegy shares fell $ 2 . 78 , or 7 . 7 percent , to $ 33 . 22 . berkshire hathaway inc . chairman warren buffett decided against investing in enron because he wasn ' t willing to sign a confidentiality agreement that would keep him from trading enron ' s debt , the new york times reported today , citing an unidentified person close to the talks . other companies approached by enron , including clayton dubilier & rice , the blackstone group and kohlberg kravis roberts & co . have also shown little interest , the newspaper said . ` ` many shrewd investors like goldman sachs might find it more profitable to just pluck off key employees rather than invest in enron , ' ' said sean egan , managing director of egan - jones rating co . sec investigation the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating enron partnerships run by the company ' s former chief financial officer . the entities bought and sold enron shares and assets , with trades costing enron $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity . enron ousted cfo andrew fastow last month . standard & poor ' s today reduced its rating on enron ' s credit - linked notes to match its downgrade last week of the company ' s unsecured bonds . s & p cut four enron credit - linked issues valued at about $ 1 . 36 billion combined to ` ` bbb ' ' from ` ` bbb + ' ' and indicated it may lower the grades again . shipman said the move isn ' t an additional downgrade and should have been made last week when s qwest bullies the analyst community and it overpromises and underdelivers . qwest has justifiably lost the trust of the investment community . it will take years of execution and fence - mending to earn this trust back . ask cendant ceo henry silverman . he is still paying for the damage inflicted upon him by former cendant chairman walter forbes , who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud charges . go with worldcom ( wcom : nasdaq - news - commentary ) instead . these guys actually get it . they are among the telecom industry ' s best operators , and they are the best dealmakers . like everyone else , they goofed , but they have found religion . this quarter ' s operating results show some promise . previously skeptical analysts at lehman and merrill had some nice things to say about the company . i think worldcom is an up stock from here . it is not going back to the $ 60 s , but i could see it above the driving age by year - end . i know it ' s also tempting to think that if the economy rebounds , consumer finance stocks will scream . you are turned on by providian ( pvn : nyse - news - commentary ) and conseco ( cnc : nyse - news - commentary ) . providian recently hired my pals at goldman sachs to help them out . forget this , too . providian feels like a doughnut to me . their balance sheet is a mess . we do not know how bad it is . they may not know how bad it is . moreover , they were not candid with the investment community . conseco announced that gary wendt and other senior managers bought a bunch of stock with their own money . while i love to see management buying stock , this one feels too staged to me . pre - wendt , conseco had a long history of management buying stock with loans from the corporate treasury . moreover , 1 million shares ( or $ 3 million ) is not that much money to wendt . i would like to see him buy $ 25 million of restricted stock directly from the company . conseco is probably the best speculative bet of the bunch , but i would still pass . it is a very high - risk situation , given the leveraged state of its balance sheet . wendt is a tremendous manager , and he did a great job with ge capital . however , he would not be the first guy to have a sequel that bombs at the box office . go with citigroup ( c : nyse - news - commentary ) instead . citigroup is the biggest and best financial services company in the world . while wendt is something special , i would draft weill and rubin ahead of him in my ceo rotisserie league . the best way to make money is to stay out of trouble . stick with singles and doubles . don ' t be tempted . fundie firing comes better late than never by james j . cramer > realmoney . com 11 / 07 / 2001 09 : 17 am est hallelujah ! someone in mutual - fund land lost his job for crummy performance . two years ago merrill lynch decided to hire a real mutual fund gunner , james mccall , and install him in the merrill lynch focus twenty and premier growth funds . mccall was from pbhg . there , the guy was a total gunner in the true basketball sense : all offense , no d . he came to merrill and played the same game , buying all of the stocks i have been railing against in these last 18 months . this guy owned them all . he proceeded to totally stink up the joint . i don ' t mourn mccall . he represented the worst strain of money manager , the kind who ' d never met a high growth stock he didn ' t like . a man who didn ' t give a hoot about valuation . his bets on bea systems , juniper , emc , sonus , celestica , oni systems and extreme should have been enough to give him the hook . but he also bit on enron ! mccall ' s funds were dead last in merrill ' s fund standing . so he left . that ' s what should happen . i just wish it had happened sooner . this industry made a mess of itself the last few years by picking managers who were reckless in their stock picks and never thought about the downside . the industry really let the investors down . the departure of mccall is a good sign that things are returning to how they should be , where you sacrifice some upside in order to spare your investors the massive downside that mccall experienced . now , let ' s hope the other mutual fund families exercise similar discretion . better late than never .

driven by improvements in ev storage and drive technologies , increasing government incentives and regulations , and ongoing concerns about the environmental and economic impact of reliance on fossil fuels , the electric vehicle industry has rapidly grown from little more than a curiosity to a multi - billion dollar global business . in the us alone , the ev industry is growing at a cagr of 27 % and is expected to reach industry revenues of more than $ 7 billion by 2005 . with its focus on lucrative , mature , and high growth niche markets within the ev industry , including motor scooters ( a $ 2 . 5 billion market in europe alone ) , off highway motorcycles and atv ' s ( $ 20 billion ) , and personal water craft ( $ 1 . 4 billion ) , we believe that armor enterprises has significant competitive advantages and early - mover status within this niche markets . 4 . armor enterprises has received significant interest in its line of electric vehicles from major distributors and is currently in the testing phase for a number of potential major contract wins . the company has announced a number of significant negotiations with major groups in europe , asia , and the americas for purchase and distribution of armor ' s line of ev products , and we anticipate that delivery of prototype models and testing will serve to validate its offering , leading to major contract and distribution agreements over the next six months . the company has recently undertaken a contract to build and deliver prototypes for its electric mountain bike , electric arv , electric go - kart , and neighborhood electric vehicle ( nev ) to be used as demonstration models for a very large private company . armor enterprises has further undertaken negotiations with one of the largest go - kart race track consortiums in europe to provide models of their electric go - karts for testing . we believe that these and other testing developments will facilitate the development of widescale distribution and sales efforts from late 2004 . 5 . the company derives significant advantages from its established strategic relationship with one of asia ' s largest two wheel vehicle manufacturers , which will prove an invaluable assistance in rapidly ramping up production , building distribution channels , and developing new product lines . strategic alliances and joint ventures are an integral component in the company ' s business strategy , enabling armor to focus its efforts , capital , and resources on core competencies while leveraging the strategic partner ' s expertise in manufacturing and distribution . the strategic relationship with one of the largest two wheeled vehicle manufacturers in the world will provide armor with access to affordable , scalable , and high quality manufacturing and a global network of distributors . this relationship will be provide major impetus for the company ' s near - term revenue and sales growth , and enable the company to meet aggressive sales targets without the capital expenditure normally associated with product development and manufacturing . armor enterprises , inc . ( otc bb : arme ) is a rapidly expanding provider of land and marine electric vehicles ( ev ) utilizing its proprietary lithium - ion battery storage and drive technologies . the company ' s innovative electric battery power drive system can be easily utilized on a wide range of vehicles including scooters , mopeds , atv ' s , go - karts , and water craft , offering tremendous improvements in range and speed over competitive electric battery products with significantly improved recharge times . armor has also recently acquired licensing rights to an innovative low pressure hydrogen turbine technology which will enable its ev ' s to safely generate battery power onboard while providing additional engine power . we believe that armor enterprises ' product line of electric vehicles are superior in quality , performance , and cost to competitors and further distinguish the company as a leader in the electric vehicle industry . we think that arme is an investment opportunity that cannot be missed , and strongly urge you to take advantage of the current pricing levels to buy now and see huge short term profits . with introduction of its line of innovative electric vehicles scheduled to begin in late 2004 , arme is poised to see major revenues this year ! ! ! with revenues of over $ 50 million expected for fy 2005 , we believe that arme presents a perfect opportunity to invest on the ground floor of the electric vehicle boom . we believe that arme will see appreciation to levels of approximately $ 5 . 00 per share within the next twelve months , and the stock could reach $ 1 . 50 within the next seven trading days ! ! forward looking statements are based on expectations , estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated . forward looking statements in this action may be identified through the use of words such as : " projects " , " foresee " , " expects " , " estimates , " " believes , " " understands " " will " , " anticipates , " or that by statements indicating certain actions " may , " " could , " or " might " occur . all information provided within this email pertaining to investing , stocks , securities must be understood as information provided and not investment advice . emerging equity alert advises all readers and subscribers to seek advice from a registered professional securities representative before deciding to trade in stocks featured within this email . none of the material within this report shall be construed as any kind of investment advice . we have been paid 20 , 000 dollars for this mailing .

2	Subject: slotting order confirmation may 18 , 2004 etacitne { % begin _ split 76 % } the rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train . i am afraid to say how many baggage - waggons followed the engine , certainly a score ; then came the chinese , then we , then the families , and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what , if i have it rightly , is called his caboose . the class to which i belonged was of course far the largest , and we ran over , so to speak , to both sides ; so that there were some caucasians among the chinamen , and some bachelors among the families . but our own car was pure from admixture , save for one little boy of eight or nine who had the whooping - cough . at last , about six , the long train crawled out of the transfer station and across the wide missouri river to omaha , westward bound . it was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars . there was thunder in the air , which helped to keep us restless . a man played many airs upon the cornet , and none of them were much attended to , until he came to " home , sweet home . " it was truly strange to note how the talk ceased at that , and the faces began to lengthen . i have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or bad ; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best described as a brutal assault upon the feelings . pathos must be relieved by dignity of treatment . if you wallow naked in the pathetic , like the author of " home , sweet home , " you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion ; and even while yet they are moved , they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their weakness . it did not come to tears that night , for the experiment was interrupted . an elderly , hard - looking man , with a goatee beard and about as much appearance of sentiment an you would expect from a retired slaver , turned with a start and bade the performer stop that " damned thing . " " i ' ve heard about enough of that , " he added ; " give us something about the good country we ' re going to . " a murmur of adhesion ran round the car ; the performer took the instrument from his lips , laughed and nodded , and then struck into a dancing measure ; and , like a new timotheus , stilled immediately the emotion he had raised . aka : vicqodin , xacnax , suprervisagra and much morne - no presccription neyeded ! civilizirano gullweig gxol sylg the day faded ; the lamps were lit ; a party of ht ht men , who got off next evening at north platte , stood together on the stern platform , singing " the sweet by - and - bye " with very tuneful voices ; the chums began to put up their beds ; and it seemed as if the business of the day were at an end . but it was not so ; for , the train stopping at some station , the cars were instantly thronged with the natives , wives and fathers , ht men and maidens , some of them in little more than nightgear , some with stable lanterns , and all offering beds for sale . their charge began with twenty - five cents a cushion , but fell , before the train went on again , to fifteen , with the bed - board gratis , or less than one - fifth of what i had paid for mine at the transfer . this is my contribution to the economy of future emigrants . a great personage on an american train is the newsboy . he sells books ( such books ! ) , papers , fruit , lollipops , and cigars ; and on emigrant journeys , soap , towels , tin washing dishes , tin coffee pitchers , coffee , tea , sugar , and tinned eatables , mostly hash or beans and bacon . early next morning the newsboy went around the cars , and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of the hour . it requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds ; but washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of three . i myself entered a little after sunrise into articles of agreement , and became one of the firm of pennsylvania , shakespeare , and dubuque . shakespeare was my own nickname on the cars ; pennsylvania that of my bedfellow ; and dubuque , the name of a place in the state of iowa , that of an amiable ht fellow going west to cure an asthma , and retarding his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking , and sometimes chewing and smoking together . i have never seen tobacco so sillily abused . shakespeare bought a tin washing - dish , dubuque a towel , and pennsylvania a brick of soap . the partners used these instruments , one after another , according to the order of their first awaking ; and when the firm had finished there was no want of borrowers . each filled the tin dish at the water filter opposite the stove , and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car . there he knelt down , supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing , and made a shift to wash his face and neck and hands ; a cold , an insufficient , and , if the train is moving rapidly , a somewhat dangerous toilet .

2	Subject: alliance pipeline construction is complete note : this text was released today by natural gas intelligence after an interview with alliance personnel construction completed on alliance pipeline the c $ 4 . 6 billion alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline , designed to transport 1 . 325 bcf / d from northeast british columbia to chicago , has completed its construction phase and now is commissioning the main line , laterals , compressors and supervisory equipment . the final weld was completed last week near regina , sk , and alliance now is injecting linepack . the 1 , 857 mile mainline is stretched to the chicago area from northeastern bc . october is still the target month to begin service of the pipeline , which will carry both natural gas and liquids . the pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36 - inch diameter high - pressure line . there will be 14 mainline compressor stations : seven in canada and seven in the u . s . when it began construction in 1999 , alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15 - year contracts worth a total of $ 8 . 2 billion . the large volumes of gas alliance will haul from western canada into the u . s . midwest is expected to have a major impact on existing pipelines , markets and prices . transcanada pipelines already has filed for new tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts on its line and instead are routing their gas through alliance . new gas that makes its way into the chicago area could be sent on to southern ontario through the chicago - to - dawn vector pipeline , scheduled to open in late october with intial capacity of 720 bcf / d . the foothills / northern border route from western canada into the midwest also is expected to see some slack . alliance spokesman jay godfrey said last month that " when october comes we won ' t be in the position that we ' ll have to start filling the pipe . it essentially already is going to be full . " connections to 37 gas plants are already complete . investors in alliance pipeline limited partnerships include affiliates of coastal ( 14 . 4 % ) , enbridge ( 21 . 4 % ) , fort chicago energy partners lp ( 26 % ) , williams ( 14 . 6 % ) and westcoast energy ( 23 . 6 % ) .

2	Subject: western issues 7 / 23 / 01 below is the weekly western issues update sent to tim earlier . if you have any questions , please feel free to kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) . executive summary ferc multi - party refund negotiations bpa financials & smelter agreements bc hydro rate freeze power refunds the big event that happened last week in washington dc , in regards to california and the rest of the western energy markets , was that multi - party negotiations that flopped - apparently the difference between $ 8 . 9 billion and $ 703 . 6 million between parties could not be settled . below is a rough breakdown corporate offerings : williams , duke , reliant , dynegy , & mirant : $ 510 million combined powerex ( bc hydro ) : $ 125 million 15 power marketers including enron : $ 49 . 6 million 7 california municipal utilities : $ 6 . 5 million load - serving entities outside ca : $ 12 . 5 million northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges , however , judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims of $ 611 million in overcharges , stating " there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties . they did not have data on what they are owed , nor an amount of refunds due them . " contrary to the judge ' s claim , a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference , although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts . wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast - track status as california . ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressure - the result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together . below is another rough breakdown of the claims : pacificcorp : $ 6 . 7 million snohomish pud : $ 229 million tacoma power : $ 71 . 9 million seattle city light : $ 222 million port of seattle : $ 11 . 1 million bpa : $ 70 million * bpa bpa borrowing : sen . patty murray ( d - wa ) has been leading the fight for bpa ' s request of $ 2 b in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the senate voted to increase access to additional funds , however , sen . murray has promised to fight the re - authorization caveat . murray ' s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about ' bumping up against spending caps ' when it added the mandate for annual re - authorization . bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of 2003 unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of $ 3 . 75 billion - - the increase got through the senate energy & water development subcommittee , but had the caveat added when it reached the full appropriations committee . increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure , retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs . we can expect to see more action coming out of sen . murray ' s office . refunds : recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities ( including bpa ) seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting . this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings . if a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg & e ( & potentially bankrupt socal . ed . ) , it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of $ 70 m to $ 100 m . however , while bpa ' s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances , they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the $ 167 million in gross sales they made from california bpa administration : the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa ' s administrator . the entire northwest delegation ( democrats and republicans from the bpa region ) has asked that he be made the full - time administrator . however , since many of the decision - makers at doe are conservative republicans , they ' re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat . at this time , doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo . dsi / aluminum smelter - load reduction agreements : bpa is in the hot seat right now , realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources . few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable , considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year . consequently , dsi ' s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices ( which are still historically very high , but dropping ) . currently , there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations . alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter , and kaiser , free from the money and the constraints of a load - reduction agreement , is also attempting to restart plants . we will continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story develops . bc hydro rate freeze : the current rate freeze was imposed by the former ndp government , and it ends 30 september 2001 . it is up to the government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze , and before it can do that , it has to schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the bcuc ' s purview . it has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing , and people are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions about overall energy policy . a rate hearing will be delayed until the new government has completed its administrative " core review " and decided on a broader energy policy , including its goals for bc hydro . lifting the rate freeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the rate stabilization account - this money has been redirected elsewhere over the past few years , leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of low - water conditions that have surfaced this year . bc hydro wants the freeze lifted , and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing the rate freeze given that it was put in place by the ndp and flouts free enterprise principles . this suggests the rate freeze is on the way out , but it may persist beyond the original 30 september deadline for the reasons outlined above . how long it persists depends on how long it takes the new government to complete the core review .
