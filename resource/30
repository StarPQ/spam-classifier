2	Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit , virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 , geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise , on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation . the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data . capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company . in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 . as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area . a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market . conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream . for additional information , visit investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

( ii ) 65 % for us ( the panel officials ) . ( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by both you and us ) incidental to the actualization of this project . we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please note that this transaction is 100 % safe and risk - free . we intend to effect the transfer within ten ( 10 ) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above : your company ' s name , address , telephone and fax numbers ; we will use your company ' s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract in favour of your company . we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction . i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when i hear from you . please get in touch through my email address above . best regards , dr . ahmed adams - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - pos?lejte sms p?es internet zdarma a bez reklamy . pouze s tiscali . v?ce na http : / / www . tiscali . cz

2	Subject: california update 09 . 03 . 01 - - debate over direct access heats up this story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the da suspension date . the treasurer , angelides , is taking a hard line . we are working with others to get the date pushed back . california puc staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to . they have made inquiries to our customers , including uc / csu . best , jeff state fights 6 , 000 firms ' energy deals discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers bernadette tansey , chronicle staff writer sunday , september 2 , 2001 ? 2001 san francisco chronicle url : thousands of california businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last - minute contracts with private power suppliers . more than 6 , 000 firms , including big retail chains and industrial plants , signed discounted power contracts in july and august as market prices dropped . state officials are incensed , saying the private " direct access " contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses . state treasurer phil angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for california . " i think it ' s wrong and it ' s immoral , " angelides said . state officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because california businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state public utilities commission . the puc is set to consider the retroactive ban thursday . but energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the puc had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday . " the drafts were not consistent , " said tracy fairchild , a spokeswoman for alliance for retail energy markets , a consortium of generators and energy suppliers . " which one were we supposed to take seriously ? " the energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts . angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $ 12 . 5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for california ' s emergency power purchases . the burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access - - a core provision of the state ' s 1996 deregulation law . deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers . but the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power . to make sure the state ' s outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers , the legislature in january directed the puc to suspend direct access . by that time , most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices . the puc postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions . but by july , market prices had come down , and energy providers like enron energy services , aes new energy and strategic energy were again offering direct access contracts . businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in june , said phoenix energy consultant gina coleman . coleman said she helped five retail chains with " a significant number " of stores in california negotiate contracts with strategic energy this summer . " business is business , and if you can get a better price for something , you should , " said coleman , who declined to name her clients . she said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in california and hold their prices down . daniel douglass , an attorney for the alliance for retail energy markets , said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law . he said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled . angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state ' s long - term power contracts . " you can ' t take advantage of the state ' s stabilizing the rates , then say , ' thank you very much , ' and stick everyone else with the bill , " angelides said . state officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in july and august , nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers . figures compiled by the puc show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6 , 000 new direct access contracts in july alone . a rough calculation suggests that , as a result , the firms might contribute as much as $ 64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs . the loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale , state officials said . bu angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education , health care and children ' s services . " what they ' re talking about doing , " he said , " is holding us hostage until they get what they want .

2	Subject: california 6 / 13 executive summary - cpuc rules that socal must pay 15 % of debt to qfs ( approximately $ 50 million ) - ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal - voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring - fencing by eix parent - bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report 1 . socal loses cpuc ruling , but retains appeal option as you may have seen , bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted 5 - 0 to force socal to make 15 % of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california . cpuc rules allow 30 days to appeal its rulings , leaving a window open for socal to buy more time . 2 . voluntary filing in ? with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing , the key now is how socal ' s board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors . in other words , sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing . a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily . the recent ring - fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross - default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal . in and of outself , it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing . 3 . involuntary out ? sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal . this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy . sources report that in creditor discussions , there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid . " people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else , but not the debt holders , " a source commented . the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place . also , they receive high capacity fees in the summer ( these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees ) . these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling , 4 - year basis and will be re - calculated next year . the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation , incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place . 4 . montali supporting qfs judge montali , by his recent rulings , is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships . he is trying to help them through his rulings . for example , as long as qfs remain on line , those who petition can receive additional payments from pg & e . over a 4 - month period , these payments equal 20 % of the qfs ' pre - petition claims . this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg & e . 5 . ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly " deeply concerned " about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us . ( ge has over 70 % of the gas turbine market . ) ge is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is not raising its prices due to concerns about instability . sources believe that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will have to be restrucured in five years .

2	Subject: discount rates and risk capital dear vince : i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of that addresses these issues . very briefly , 1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate . 2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s opportunity cost of capital . 3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify some of the issues that i have raised . please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this . please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you . regards , sheridan - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu

2	Subject: merger news articles a full list of news articles will be distributed on monday , but here is some of the initial coverage . business / financial desk ; section a rival to buy enron , top energy trader , after financial fall by alex berenson and andrew ross sorkin 11 / 10 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company with its stock plunging and its finances in doubt , the world ' s largest energy trader , the enron corporation , agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the deal is an extraordinary turnabout for enron , a houston - based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide . its chairman , kenneth l . lay , a big contributor to the republican party , provided political influence , while its former chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas . but last winter , when california ' s effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts , enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger . recent disclosures of discrepancies in enron ' s financial statements and an investigation by the securities and exchange commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade . as other companies became wary of doing business with it , enron - - also facing a potential cash squeeze - - apparently had little choice but to find a buyer , and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week . for critics who had complained about enron ' s market power and its dominance , the combination poses additional concerns . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , led by the justice department and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns power - generating plants and enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas - - fuel for the state ' s electric power plants . buying enron at a deep discount - - it has lost $ 60 billion in market value this year - - could make dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas . but the agreement carries big risks as well . along with enron ' s gas pipelines and high - technology trading floor , dynegy will take on enron ' s substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that enron has spun over the last decade . in addition to the $ 13 billion in debt that enron carries on its books , it has guaranteed at least $ 4 billion in off - balance sheet loans , and the hidden debt could total as much as $ 10 billion , said carol coale , a stock analyst with prudential securities . charles l . watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said yesterday that dynegy could sort through enron ' s tangled finances . ' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' ' the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors . mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said . mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said . in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' ' to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed . investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 . ' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy . as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year . the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said . some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said . on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said . enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations . still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation . mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow . with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed . to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further . by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual . ' ' on wednesday , enron ' s stock fell as low as $ 7 a share , its lowest level in more than a decade . that day , news of the enron and dynegy talks leaked out . by late wednesday , the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal . but dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether enron ' s credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating . the deal moved forward yesterday after dynegy was assured enron ' s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced , according to company officials . dynegy and enron had provided standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , the main credit agencies , with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction , mr . watson said . under the deal , enron shareholders will receive 0 . 2685 share of dynegy stock for each enron share , or $ 9 . 80 based on dynegy ' s closing price on thursday . enron ' s stock gained 22 cents yesterday , to $ 8 . 63 . ' ' i never thought our stock price would be at this level , ' ' mr . lay said yesterday . enron ' s shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company , and dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company ' s 14 - member board . if the deal falls apart , enron or dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of $ 350 million . to protect dynegy ' s and chevrontexaco ' s cash infusion , the money will go to an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . if the merger is not completed , dynegy will have the right to buy the unit . an army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies . lehman brothers inc . acted as financial adviser and baker botts and akin , gump , strauss , hauer & feld acted as counsel for dynegy . j . p . morgan & company and salomon smith barney acted as financial advisers for enron , and vinson & elkins and weil gotshal & manges acted as the company ' s counsel . pillsbury winthrop served as counsel to chevrontexaco . chart : ' ' a marriage of strength and weakness ' ' a merger of enron and dynegy would bring together two of the country ' s biggest energy companies - - and save enron from potential collapse . graph tracks the weekly closes of enron shares from 1999 through 2001 . top north american gas marketers sales , of billion cubic feet per day * enron : 24 . 6 reliant : 13 . 2 duke energy : 12 . 8 bp : 12 . 3 mirant : 11 . 8 dynegy : 10 . 9 top north american power marketers sales , of million megawatt hours * enron : 212 . 5 american electric power : 134 . 5 duke energy : 118 . 1 reliant resources : 86 . 1 pg simmons natural gas week ) ( pg . c 2 ) dynegy , enron merger deal worth almost $ 25 billion melita marie garza 11 / 10 / 2001 krtbn knight - ridder tribune business news : chicago tribune - illinois copyright ( c ) 2001 krtbn knight ridder tribune business news ; source : world reporter ( tm ) enron corp . , the nation ' s biggest power trader , was taken over by its smaller , more conservative rival , dynegy inc . in a merger deal valued at nearly $ 25 billion , company officials announced friday . the combined company will be called dynegy inc . and will be headed by chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive . if it wins regulatory and shareholder approval , the deal would propel dynegy , the sixth - largest u . s . power trader , to the no . 1 position , with more than 30 percent of the market . the houston - based competitors are new - breed energy companies , formed to capitalize on wholesale power marketing and trading , with dynegy emphasizing its own power generation capabilities . enron , meanwhile , has been laid low in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and by a series of revelations about questionable accounting practices . enron this week was forced to restate its earnings over the past five years - - revising them downward by 20 percent , or $ 586 million - - and has seen its stock price plunge more than 80 percent in the past three weeks . both enron and dynegy have extensive business dealings in illinois , one of the first states to begin deregulating its electric power industry ; among other things , dynegy owns illinois power , a downstate utility . the new dynegy would become one of the largest companies in the world , with revenues exceeding $ 200 billion and assets of roughly $ 90 billion , company officials said . by comparison , exxonmobil , the nation ' s largest company , reported revenues of $ 232 . 7 billion in 2000 . " we needed to do something to strengthen our balance sheet and get the investor community focused on the core energy business , " said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive . " we looked at several alternatives ; this was in the best interests of our employees and shareholders . " lay said he would not have a role in running the new company , but was considering a request to serve on the newly combined board . watson , dynegy ' s chairman , said the merger compact included escape clauses for dynegy . " but , i wouldn ' t be standing here if i expected to see that ( used ) . i really believe the value degradation in enron had nothing to do with their core business . we looked under the hood , it is just as strong as we thought it was . " still , watson acknowledged the possibility that more problems may surface at enron . " i don ' t think anybody can absolutely unequivocally say there ' s nothing ( more ) there , " he said . dynegy ' s stock price closed higher friday , rising $ 2 . 26 , or 6 . 2 percent , to $ 38 . 76 . enron ' s stock was down 33 cents , or 3 . 7 percent , at $ 8 . 63 a share . together , the companies have natural gas sales of about 40 billion cubic feet per day through the third quarter of 2001 and power sales exceeding 500 million megawatt hours through the third quarter of 2001 . in addition , the new dynegy ' s delivery network will include more than 22 , 000 megawatts of generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of interstate pipelines . in enron , dynegy is taking on a company saddled with a heavy debt load and a credit rating that has been downgraded to near junk bond status and is under the cloud of a securities and exchange commission investigation . under the stock for stock swap portion of the deal , valued at $ 8 . 846 billion , dynegy is paying about $ 10 . 41 a share for the 850 million outstanding enron shares . dynegy would pay . 2685 shares of its stock for each share of enron . in addition , dynegy agreed to provide $ 1 . 5 billion infusion in cash to help stabilize its much larger competitor and assume an estimated $ 15 billion in debt . just thursday enron reported that its debt was an estimated $ 12 . 9 billion pending completion of financial statements dated sept . 30 . a day later the company ' s accounting of its debt jumped $ 2 billion . dynegy ' s current shareholders , including chevron texaco corp . , will end up owning 64 percent of the new company . chevron texaco said it would invest an additional $ 2 . 5 billion in dynegy . enron ' s stockholders will own about 36 percent of the combined company ' s stock at closing , which is anticipated for the third quarter of 2002 . in illinois , in addition to illinois power , dynegy owns a chicago area electricity peaker plant and is a partner with nicor inc . , in nicor energy , an unregulated natural gas utility in the chicago area . enron ' s subsidiary , enron energy services , has a high - profile contract to provide 60 percent of chicago city government ' s electricity . it also has contracts to provide electricity to quaker oats co . and the university of chicago , among others . in addition to watson , other top dynegy management will remain in place in the new company . steve bergstrom , president of dynegy inc . , and rob doty , chief financial officer of dynegy inc . , will retain those positions in the combined company . enron ' s current president and chief operating officer , greg whalley , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . the board of directors of the combined company will be comprised of 14 members . dynegy ' s 11 designees will include three from chevrontexaco . enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members . business / financial desk ; section c regulators struggle with a marketplace created by enron by jeff gerth with richard a . oppel jr . 11 / 10 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company washington , nov . 9 - - for years , the enron corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived , pushing relentlessly on capitol hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation ' s natural gas and electricity businesses . its achievement , as one enron executive said today , in creating a ' ' regulatory black hole ' ' fit nicely with what he called the company ' s ' ' core management philosophy , which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency . ' ' now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented . ' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants . ' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university . mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal . the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' ' pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates . but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions . in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' ' a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' ' enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility . for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street . in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay . now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' ' the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring . ' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' ' energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight . electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear . in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices . in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices . raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever . ' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' ' enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers . under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying . indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said . but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with . earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company . enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' ' dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market .

" with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner , " said dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson . enron , the united states ' largest energy trader , has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and credit rating in the past month following disclosures of deals being investigated by the u . s . securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest . financial desk the nation smaller rival to acquire teetering enron power : energy giant that pressed for deregulation in california is on the brink of collapse . nancy rivera brooks ; thomas s . mulligan ; nancy vogel times staff writers 11 / 10 / 2001 los angeles times home edition a - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company enron corp . , the once - highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to profit from california ' s energy deregulation made it a target of consumer and political backlash , on friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival dynegy inc . the roughly $ 7 . 7 - billion deal is a stunning plot twist for houston - based enron , which was vilified in california as it was being glorified on wall street . in only the last month , a series of disturbing financial revelations pushed to the edge of ruin this once - powerful company , whose top executives had lectured california on its energy foibles and who influenced the direction of national energy policy . enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and , in the end , financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing . now , the company that late last year had a market value of $ 63 billion is worth one - tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross - town competitor one - quarter its size . enron ' s proud and influential chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , who became a focus of bitter attacks by california politicians and regulators , would lose his job , as would many others at enron . even the name would disappear . the combined company would be called dynegy inc . if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals . california officials took no joy in enron ' s fate friday , though there was perhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state . " this is basically a rogue corporation , " said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . " it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . " a failed experiment steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation . " in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , " he said . said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : " nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . " enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business . under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy . enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date . if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company . " this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , " said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings . even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general . but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said . " this is an encouraging development for the energy industry , " said stephen baum , chairman of sempra energy , the san diego - based parent of southern california gas and san diego gas ; photographer : associated press ; photo : " this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , " says charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive . ; ; photographer : associated press dynegy to buy enron associated press 11 / 10 / 2001 deseret news do 7 copyright ( c ) 2001 deseret news publishing co . houston - - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt . the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders . under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said . " with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase . watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books . " as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , " watson said . enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals and fiber - optic bandwidth . dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities . at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles . " we looked under the hood . . . it ' s just as strong as it ever was , " watson said . under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne . that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse . in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged . dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder . the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 million and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of " non - core " enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . steve bergstrom will remain as president of dynegy . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through . " i am personally committed to working with chuck watson , steve bergstrom and their colleagues in the months ahead to accomplish the merger and to build a solid foundation for future value creation , " lay said . dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron . " few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , " whalley said . " together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . " the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . " there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , " said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities . business dynegy , enron ok $ 25 billion deal ; new company would rank among largest melita marie garza , tribune staff reporter 11 / 10 / 2001 chicago tribune north final ; n 1 ( copyright 2001 by the chicago tribune ) enron corp . , the nation ' s biggest power trader , was taken over by its smaller , more conservative rival , dynegy inc . , in a merger deal valued at nearly $ 25 billion , company officials announced friday . the combined company would retain the dynegy name and would be headed by chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive . if it wins regulatory and shareholder approval , the deal would propel dynegy , the sixth - largest u . s . power trader , to the no . 1 position , with more than 30 percent of the market . the houston - based rivals are new - breed energy companies , formed to capitalize on wholesale power marketing and trading , with dynegy emphasizing its own power generation capabilities . enron , meanwhile , has been laid low in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and by a series of revelations about questionable accounting practices . enron this week was forced to restate its earnings over the past five years - - revising them downward by 20 percent , or $ 586 million - - and has seen its stock price plunge more than 80 percent in the past three weeks . both enron and dynegy have extensive business dealings in illinois , one of the first states to begin deregulating its electric power industry ; among other things , dynegy owns illinois power , a downstate utility . the new dynegy would be one of the largest companies in the world , with revenues exceeding $ 200 billion and assets of roughly $ 90 billion , company officials said . by comparison , exxonmobil corp . , the nation ' s largest company , reported revenues of $ 232 . 7 billion in 2000 . " we needed to do something to strengthen our balance sheet and get the investor community focused on the core energy business , " said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and ceo . " we looked at several alternatives ; this was in the best interests of our employees and shareholders . " lay said he would not have a role in running the new company but was considering a request to serve on the newly combined board . watson said the merger agreement included escape clauses for dynegy , " but i wouldn ' t be standing here if i expected to see that [ used ] . i really believe the value degradation in enron had nothing to do with their core business . we looked under the hood ; it is just as strong as we thought it was . " still , watson acknowledged the possibility that more problems may surface at enron . " i don ' t think anybody can absolutely unequivocally say there ' s nothing [ more ] there , " he said . dynegy ' s stock price closed higher friday , rising $ 2 . 26 , or 6 . 2 percent , to $ 38 . 76 . enron ' s stock was up 22 cents , or 2 . 6 percent , at $ 8 . 63 a share . through the third quarter of 2001 , the companies together have natural gas sales of about 40 billion cubic feet per day and power sales exceeding 500 million megawatt hours . in addition , the new dynegy ' s delivery network would include more than 22 , 000 megawatts of generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of interstate pipelines . in enron , dynegy is taking on a company saddled with a heavy debt load , a credit rating that has been downgraded to near junk bond status and which is under the cloud of a securities and exchange commission investigation . big premium under the stock - for - stock - swap portion of the deal , valued at $ 8 . 846 billion , dynegy is paying the equivalent of $ 10 . 41 a share for the 850 million outstanding enron shares , a 24 percent premium . dynegy would pay . 2685 shares of its stock for each share of enron . in addition , dynegy agreed to provide a $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion to help stabilize its larger competitor and to assume an estimated $ 15 billion in debt . on thursday enron reported that its debt was an estimated $ 12 . 9 billion pending completion of financial statements dated sept . 30 . a day later the company ' s accounting of its debt jumped $ 2 billion . dynegy ' s current shareholders , including chevron texaco corp . , will end up owning 64 percent of the new company . chevron texaco said it would invest an additional $ 2 . 5 billion in dynegy . enron ' s stockholders would own about 36 percent of the combined company ' s stock at closing , which is anticipated in the third quarter of 2002 . chicago - area operations in illinois , in addition to illinois power , dynegy owns a chicago - area electricity peaker plant and is a partner with nicor inc . in nicor energy , an unregulated natural gas utility in the chicago market . enron ' s subsidiary , enron energy services , has a high - profile contract to provide 60 percent of chicago ' s city government ' s electricity . it also has contracts to provide power to quaker oats co . and the university of chicago , among others . in addition to watson , other top dynegy management would remain in place in the new company . president steve bergstrom and rob doty , chief financial officer , would retain those positions in the combined company . enron ' s president and chief operating officer , greg whalley , would become an executive vice president . the board of directors of the combined company would have 14 members . dynegy ' s 11 designees would include three from chevrontexaco . enron would have the right to designate a minimum of three board members . financial enron accepts $ 8 billion buyout offer from dynegy ; energy giant was forced to negotiating table after disclosing that it had overstated earnings peter behr washington post staff writer 11 / 10 / 2001 the washington post final eol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved embattled enron corp . yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $ 8 billion from crosstown rival dynegy inc . if the deal is completed , it would end houston - based enron ' s reign as the leader in the huge energy trading markets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation . its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered , enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a complex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the trading powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligations . four top enron officials have resigned or been replaced since july and , once dynegy takes control , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth lay , will also leave the company . lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept dynegy ' s offer to serve on the combined company ' s board . " it ' s been a good ride for a long time , " lay said in a conference call last night . " the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun . " the final deal was announced after the close of stock trading . enron ' s shares - - which had fallen from $ 33 to $ 8 after the disclosures - - ended the day slightly higher , at $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s stock closed at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 . dynegy offered all stock for the enron shares , so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with dynegy ' s stock price . dynegy also said it would assume about $ 13 billion in enron debt , bringing the total value of the transaction to around $ 21 billion . dynegy ' s rescue of enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion , which will be supplied by chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy stockholder . chevrontexaco will invest another $ 1 billion in dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed , which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . the takeover agreement gives dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of enron ' s financial condition convinced him that the company ' s trading and pipeline businesses were solid . " we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it looked just as strong as we thought it was . " watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from enron . until the partnership mess , enron was the nation ' s dominant energy trader , and it had front - door political connections to the white house . lay , its longtime chairman , raised more then $ 100 , 000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend george w . bush . enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid - 1990 s , as first natural gas , and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level . its revenues leaped from $ 9 . 2 billion in 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year . during those heady times , the houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its byzantine bookkeeping . " it was always very difficult to get information , " said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . " they would always rebuff you . " until this fall , the muscular company seemed too big to stumble , said investment manager david coxe , with harris insight equity fund in chicago . coxe bought 78 , 000 shares of enron at $ 40 a share in august , after wrestling with the decision for months , he said . then jeffrey skilling , enron ' s chief executive and strategic mastermind , unexpectedly resigned . the stock , which had been as high as $ 90 in august 2000 , pitched downward . " enron seemed so indispensable to the nation ' s energy markets that i thought it inconceivable it could implode , " coxe said . " that ' s how i got sucked in . " enron ' s fall is " classic hubris , " coxe said : a greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods - - " in this case , the rules of the system . " among the rules that enron now acknowledges it didn ' t follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created . the purpose of the partnerships , enron said , was to reduce the risks of investments in internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted . the accounting errors were described in a 20 - page sec filing enron made thursday . the errors resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders ' equity . the company also said it had overstated its earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 . enron created partnerships that would buy major assets - - such as a power plant - - that enron wanted to sell , or in other cases , assets such as fiber - optic cable networks that enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet . the partnerships had outside investors , but the general partner of two of them was enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew fastow . he earned $ 30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships , according to the sec document . enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock , or securities convertible into stock . some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans , resulting in the $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholder equity , enron now says . investors are asking why enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen llp , did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place . enron ' s sec filing mentions but does not explain some " proposed audit adjustments " over the past four years that were overruled . even though , as enron now acknowledges , it created an information barrier , masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules , many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier , some analysts acknowledge . " it was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say , ' i don ' t understand it , ' " gagliardi said . the questions are now coming , from a new committee reporting to enron ' s board that will investigate how the company ' s financial reporting was handled ; from the sec ; and , eventually , from teams of lawyers representing aggrieved shareholders . lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that enron employees other than fastow had profited from the partnership activity . enron directors had approved fastow ' s management of the partnerships , but fastow quit the partnerships in july and was then replaced as chief financial officer . enron this week fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mourdant , an enron division lawyer , who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by fastow . the enron report to the sec describes a central role in these transactions played by michael j . kopper , an associate of fastow who left enron in july to take over fastow ' s financial interests in the partnership , the company said . enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovered about outside partnership investments . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com financial desk the nation news analysis a visionary fallen from grace james flanigan times staff writer 11 / 10 / 2001 los angeles times home edition a - 22 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company a year ago , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay was on top of the energy world . as a leading fund - raiser , contributor and energy advisor to the bush administration , he played a key role in shaping the new president ' s energy policy . as head of the world ' s largest energy trading company , he had an enormous influence on the price of energy in california and across the nation . enron ' s highflying stock helped him cash out $ 123 million in stock options last year alone . on friday , with enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . , lay ' s career and reputation are in shambles . under the merger , he will be stripped of a management job . his integrity is tattered , with enron ' s controversial financial dealings under federal investigation . enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged because the company ' s stock lost 80 % of its value in recent weeks . the rapid rise and fall of lay , 58 , is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world ' s energy markets was overcome with arrogance , associates and critics say . under lay , enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its financial collapse , they say . that in turn could have resulted in a widespread disruption in energy supplies . " enron ' s behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets . it is a very serious matter , " said edward r . muller , an energy investor and former president of edison international ' s mission energy subsidiary . " nobody denies he ' s smart , but it ' s a question of integrity , " said raymond plank , chief executive of apache corp . and an associate of lay ' s in houston ' s vibrant oil and gas industry . lay and longtime partner jeffrey k . skilling , who served briefly as enron ' s chief executive before resigning abruptly in august , rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designed to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy . lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new , market - driven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmission . the financial markets that lay and his enron associates created had an enormous effect on california ' s disastrous experiment in electricity deregulation . critics say his influence was excessive and misguided . " ken lay was a mystic , " said state sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron . " whatever he said had to make sense because he was ken lay . it was hero worship . many of the people working as economists at the federal energy regulatory commission worshiped ken lay . as a consequence , the things enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged , intellectually and otherwise . " lay , who has a doctorate in economics , had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for his children ' s education . in the navy in the late 1960 s , lay was assigned to the defense department because of his economic acumen . " he allocated pentagon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military , " said mark palmer , chief spokesman for enron . lay worked for exxon and other energy firms in the 1970 s , amid soaring oil prices , gasoline shortages and still - regulated natural gas . he headed houston natural gas , a predecessor firm of enron , in the 1980 s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for houston ' s energy industries . when the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any producer , lay turned enron into a foremost firm in the new , deregulated industry . still , enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980 s , with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling . it was then that skilling , a mckinsey ; photographer : reuters business struggling enron agrees to takeover by smaller rival dynegy one - time energy giant and southern co . often scrapped over access to markets matthew c . quinn staff 11 / 10 / 2001 the atlanta journal - constitution home f . 1 ( copyright , the atlanta journal and constitution - 2001 ) energy giant enron corp . capitulated to a mounting financial crisis friday and agreed to be taken over by a smaller competitor . but atlanta - based southern co . was not gloating at the misfortunes of its vanquished rival . it wasn ' t easy . for years , the two companies were locked in a struggle over access to electricity markets . enron pushed for competition and deregulation , while southern resisted to protect its dominance in the fast - growing southeast . sometimes the battle got nasty . " if thomas alva edison came back from the dead and called southern co . to get some electricity , he ' d find that nothing has changed , " jeffrey skilling , then enron ' s president , said in november 1997 . " these guys are living in an industry that was created 100 years ago , and they want to keep it that way . " fast forward four years . southern co . has split itself in two , retaining its regulated southeastern utility business and spinning off its own unregulated power generation and energy trading arm , mirant corp . southern reported net income of $ 1 billion for the first nine months of this year , and mirant ' s profits were $ 538 million . southern ' s shares are up 19 percent this year . mirant ' s have declined 7 percent . enron , on the other hand , lost 90 percent of its stock market value this year alone and this past week restated earnings for the past 4 1 / 2 years , reducing profit by more than $ 500 million . skilling was named chief executive in february but abruptly resigned after six months . this week he was subpoenaed to testify in a securities and exchange commission probe of the texas company ' s questionable relationships with outside partnerships . houston - based dynegy corp . , a crosstown rival , said late friday it will buy enron - - - once valued at $ 69 billion - - - for $ 7 . 8 billion in stock . enron will be wrapped into a " new dynegy " managed by top dynegy executives . that suggested even the name enron - - - synonymous with innovation in recent years in the utility industry - - - will go by the wayside . southern spokesman todd terrell declined to comment earlier in the day on enron ' s problems . a . w . " bill ' dahlberg , who retired as southern ' s chief executive in april and is now mirant ' s board chairman , said he regretted enron ' s troubles . " they were a rival and got credit for doing a lot of innovative things in our industry , " dahlberg said . " you always like to win the competition because you do well , not because somebody else does badly . " enron was a pioneer in the wholesale trading of electricity and natural gas , and has been widely imitated , from mirant ' s sprawling energy trading floor at perimeter center to an energy management subsidiary launched this year by agl resources , parent of atlanta gas light co . as the largest u . s . energy trading firm , enron ' s tentacles run deep . it was active at the public service commission in 1998 when rules for georgia ' s natural gas deregulation were written , only to opt out of becoming a gas marketer itself . but new power co . , which is 45 percent owned by enron , became georgia ' s newest marketer this year . a dynegy - enron combination will create a $ 200 billion - a - year enterprise that will dwarf mirant in both the electricity and natural gas sectors . dynegy and mirant are considered more stable than was enron because they rely more on their own power plants for electricity and less on trading for power produced by others . and dynegy is no stranger to georgia . it is a minority partner with agl resources in georgia natural gas services , the state ' s no . 1 gas marketer . but the partners have been at odds for months . agl sued dynegy in july , alleging it " earned millions of dollars at the expense " of the marketing company that it supplies with natural gas . dynegy ' s counterclaim accused agl , among other things , of scheming to shift the partnership ' s gas supply deal to agl ' s own subsidiary , houston - based sequent energy management . dynegy in may started up a 500 megawatt natural gas - fired power plant in heard county despite opposition from nearby residents . dynegy is also a major buyer of electricity produced at southern co .

" dynegy is taking out a competitor , acquiring some attractive assets , and they ' re doing it at an incredible price , " said joseph correnti , an analyst at wayne hummer investments . the two houston - based companies began negotiations a week ago as it became apparent enron needed cash to stay in business . dynegy , which is 26 - percent owned by chevrontexaco corp . , agreed to the deal after moody ' s investors service maintained an investment - grade rating on enron , eliminating a stumbling block in negotiations . the combined company will have annual revenue of more than $ 200 billion , ranking it as one of the nation ' s 10 largest . it will have more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electric generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipeline . on thursday , enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheet through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 " should not be relied upon . " revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million and increased its debt by $ 628 million . during its recent turmoil , enron fired chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec . dynegy chief executive charles watson will head the combined company . the terms of the deal value each enron share at $ 10 . 41 , based on friday ' s closing stock prices . that represents a 21 - percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s shares closed at $ 38 . 76 , up 6 percent . it was not immediately clear what role enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would have in the new company . while watson has led a diversified company that put as much emphasis on building power plants as on energy trading , lay focused on the wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity . he had expanded enron in the 1980 s from a natural gas pipeline into the most formidable competitor in the business of energy trading , which was created by deregulation of energy markets in the united states and europe . dynegy announces $ 8 billion deal to buy larger rival enron by juan a . lozano associated press writer 11 / 09 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt . the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders . under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said . " with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase . watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books . " as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , " watson said . enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals , and fiber - optic bandwidth . dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities . at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles . " we looked under the hood and , guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , " watson said . under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne . that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse . in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged . dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder . the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of " non - core " enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson said it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts . enron has about 20 , 000 employees , while dynegy ' s work force is about 6 , 000 . watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . dynegy ' s steve bergstrom will continue as president . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through . dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron . " few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , " whalley said . " together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . " the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . " there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , " said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities . early friday , moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the company ' s long - term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade . in an sec filing , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 " should not be relied upon " and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports . the revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion . the revisions also increased the company ' s debt each of the four years , reaching $ 10 . 86 billion - $ 628 million more than previously reported - by the end of 2000 . keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity . but the company ' s stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high - speed internet unit foundered and enron had trouble collecting money from power customers in india . the stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , and news of the sec investigation surfaced . enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence , but investors dumped enron shares and sent its stock plummeting . the ousted chief financial officer , andrew fastow , ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com http : / / www . dynegy . com ap graphic dynegy enron copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

2	Subject: re : r - squared world tour good , valid points . i think that i agree that we should not have a tour strictly for " control " purposes . ted , how do you feel about the concept of a general business tour on an annual basis that would touch on , but not solely focus on controls ? from : ted murphy @ ect 02 / 11 / 2000 11 : 57 am to : rick buy , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : r - squared world tour dear r 2 : ? i would like you to consider the following in determining the appropriate ? course of action in your mission to ensure that all our offices have process , ? procedures and policies to adequately support the business activities : ? ? i believe that your going on a series of trips is precisely the wrong ? approach and not only do i think it will be relatively unproductive ( as ? compared to your tremendous productivity at home base ) but i honestly believe ? it will be counterproductive . here ' s why : ? ? 1 ) while you guys are on a plane or in a remote office , you will be less ? in touch and available to make decisions at home ? 2 ) when you are preparing to go and de - compressing from having been , you ? will be distracted , tired and attempting to catch up to all your other ? duties . ? 3 ) there are only two of you and many of them . ? 4 ) please don ' t take this the wrong way , but i question whether you even ? are the best qualified from a skill perspective ( kevin sweeney , vlady ? gorny , john vickers , et al might be the best to dig into the details ) ? 5 ) when you guys are the face , it means the rest of us are not . this ? means that our presence and authority , which will be required on ? an on - going basis in order for this to have lasting effect , will be ? completely undermined . senior people need to know that if a ? sweeney , murphy , hardy , etc walks into their office and finds something ? not right , that it will be communicated up the line with reprecussions . ? if you were to investigate anonomously , i believe that a universal theme is ? that stuff gets pointed out and nothing ever gets changed . it puts those ? in the position of knowing on the defensive and sounding shrill . ? ? my suggestions is that you stay home . sally , aa myself and others should ? develop a template for consistent analysis of the offices and a plan to ? maintain an on - going pressure and results . part of that plan would be a ? requirement to report to you guys the findings and recommendations in a ? concise way with you following up to the heads of those offices about what , ? if anything , needs to change as quickly as possible after the review . ? ? the most important things you can do will be to pave the way for our ? departure , be available to assimilate the findings and be prepared to ? follow - up . everyone already knows that they need to respect your wishes . ? they need to know ( as do we ) that we have your support and you will respect ? and act on our recommendations . ? ? thank you for indulging me . i am afraid that i am correct . ? ted ? ?

2	Subject: re : scadsa dear sir , greetings , i am mr . henry okoye the account manager of late mr . morris thompson in standard trust bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to late mr . morris thompson an american great industrialist and a resident of alaska , who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of alaska airlines flight 261 which crashed on january 31 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which i got during my investigation ; http : / / www . cnn . com / 2000 / us / 02 / 01 / alaska . airlines . list / and http : / / www . nativefederation . org / history / people / mthompson . html the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development . the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , late mr . morris thompson . in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose . on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my family picture , to proof who i am . i await your urgent responce regrads , mr . henry okoye book yourself something to look forward to in 2005 . cheap flights - http : / / www . tiscali . co . uk / travel / flights / bargain holidays - http : / / www . tiscali . co . uk / travel / holidays /

2	Subject: business intent dear sir , i am stanley woodwork , the secetary of africa white farmers co - operation ( awfc ) of zimbabwe . after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr . robert mugabe won the presidential election , the government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme . this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans . this programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister , mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse . two weeks ago , our headquartes in harare was attacked and looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building . fortunately , they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co - operation . this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government . now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe . the cash in question is us $ 46 million dollars . once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe , where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us . you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe , and the business proposal is 100 % legal and risk free . you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe . please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government . i expect 100 % confidentiality and your prompt response to this mail so as to proceed . you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork @ email . com kind regards , stanley woodwork .

jim - - - - - original message - - - - - from : sheridan titman sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 5 : 58 pm to : jim dyer subject : re : real options course feedback jim : i teach at the same time as you do . sheridan sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jim dyer sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 11 : 32 am to : sheridan titman subject : fw : real options course feedback sheridan , see the comments below . i don ' t mean to put you on the spot , and have not announced anything in class , but i am hoping that you could visit my class for about an hour one thursday afternoon to discuss your views regarding applications of option pricing concepts to " real options " . as a reminder , i ' ve attached a course outline . chris kenyon from schlumberger is speaking on april 13 , and vince kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on april 20 . i am going to be out of town on april 27 , so that leaves either next thursday ( april 6 ) or may 4 . would either of those times work for you ? i ' m not thinking of any preparation , but more of an informal discussion of the " philosophical issues " related to real options work . jim - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jim dyer sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 1 : 24 pm to : ' jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu ' subject : re : real options course feedback josh , some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded . i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at a theoretical level in our last couple of readings . the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where volatility is " given " . the problem of finding an " objective " measure of volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like to think about such ideas . i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early , and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a naive sort of way . thanks for the feedback and comments . jim - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 8 : 42 am to : jim . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu cc : josh - clevenger @ reliantenergy . com subject : real options course feedback after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools presented thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the objective of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety of problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded financial elements . as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions that result in a " house of cards " effect . my opinion at this point is that two issues are of potentially " make - or - brake " importance if i am to persuade my superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of projects whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by financial instruments . these issues are easy to guess : 1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the class has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time value questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance department that can present a firmer position on this question ? 2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate arguments against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility measures . if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that : * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of equity options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty are good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of the value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata , but what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a vertically integrated company ? * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is being proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , ) there is some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to " mature " industries . of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas sectors as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in ongoing changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and pemex ?

2	Subject:   best online pharmacy   when i read about the evils of drinking , i gave up reading . very little is needed to make a happy life . it is all within yourself , in your way of thinking . blessed is the man who , having nothing to say , abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact . treat people as if they were what they ought to be , and you help them to become what they are capable of being . no matter what looms ahead , if you can eat today , enjoy today , mix good cheer with friends today enjoy it and bless god for it . the best proof of love is trust . when solving problems , dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves . if you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer , i bet it makes beer shoot out your nose . what lies behind us and what lies before us , are only small matters compared to what lies within us . programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot - proof programs , and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots . so far , the universe is winning . blessed is the man who , having nothing to say , abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact . a woman drove me to drink and i didn ' t even have the decency to thank her . a woman drove me to drink and i didn ' t even have the decency to thank her . change is inevitable , except from vending machines . the eskimo has fifty - two names for snow because it is important to them ; there ought to be as many for love . love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does . love is a battle , love is a war ; love is a growing up . always listen to experts . they ' ll tell you what can ' t be done , and why . then do it . not all chemicals are bad . without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen , for example , there would be no way to make water , a vital ingredient in beer . try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . when you ' re in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love , or if it attributes them to her ; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you , from her , or from the meeting of your sparks . love is the beauty of the soul . can miles truly separate you from friends . . . if you want to be with someone you love , aren ' t you already there ? a book may lie dormant for fifty years or for two thousand years in a forgotten corner of a library , only to reveal , upon being opened , the marvels or the abysses that it contains , or the line that seems to have been written for me alone . in this respect the writer is not different from any other human being : whatever we say or do can have far - reaching consequences . what lies behind us and what lies before us , are only small matters compared to what lies within us . change is inevitable , except from vending machines . a human being should be able to change a diaper , plan an invasion , butcher a hog , conn a shp , design a building , write a sonnet , balance accounts , build a wall , set a bone , comfort the dying , take orders , give orders , cooperate , act alone , solve equations , analyze a new problem , pitch manure , program a computer , cook a tasty meal , fight efficiently , die gallantly . specialization is for insects . love is the immortal flow of energy that nourishes , extends and preserves . its eternal goal is life . love is always bestowed as a gift - freely , willingly and without expectation . we don ' t love to be loved ; we love to love . books are the shoes with which we tread the footsteps of great minds . the great thing about a computer notebook is that no matter how much you stuff into it , it doesn ' t get bigger or heavier . the babylon project was our last , best hope for peace . . . it failed . . . but in the year of the shadow war it became something greater : our last , best hope . . for victory . the year is 2260 , the place : babylon 5 . blessed is the man who , having nothing to say , abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact . the great thing about a computer notebook is that no matter how much you stuff into it , it doesn ' t get bigger or heavier . a happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances , but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes . whatever our souls are made of , his and mine are the same . no matter what looms ahead , if you can eat today , enjoy today , mix good cheer with friends today enjoy it and bless god for it . opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work . never doubt that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world . indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . treat people as if they were what they ought to be , and you help them to become what they are capable of being . a kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years . the great thing about television is that if something important happens anywhere in the world , day or night , you can always change the channel . always listen to experts . they ' ll tell you what can ' t be done , and why . then do it . a happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances , but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes . the game of life is not so much in holding a good hand as playing a poor hand well . i discovered i always have choices and sometimes it ' s only a choice of attitude . if we had no winter , the spring would not be so pleasant ; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity , prosperity would not be so welcome . 24 hours in a day , 24 beers in a case . coincidence ? you can ' t wait for inspiration . you have to go after it with a club . programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot - proof programs , and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots . so far , the universe is winning . too often we give our children answers to remember rather than problems to solve . touch is the most fundamental sense . a baby experiences it , all over , before he is born and long after he learns to use sight , hearing , or taste , and no human ever ceases to need it . keep your children short on pocket money - but long on hugs . you can ' t be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline . it helps if you have some kind of a football team , or some nuclear weapons , but at the very least you need a beer . not all chemicals are bad . without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen , for example , there would be no way to make water , a vital ingredient in beer . a woman drove me to drink and i didn ' t even have the decency to thank her . treat people as if they were what they ought to be , and you help them to become what they are capable of being . the problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind . iron rusts from disuse ; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen ; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind . a human being should be able to change a diaper , plan an invasion , butcher a hog , conn a shp , design a building , write a sonnet , balance accounts , build a wall , set a bone , comfort the dying , take orders , give orders , cooperate , act alone , solve equations , analyze a new problem , pitch manure , program a computer , cook a tasty meal , fight efficiently , die gallantly . specialization is for insects . not all chemicals are bad . without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen , for example , there would be no way to make water , a vital ingredient in beer . try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . true friendship comes when the silence between two people is comfortable . no matter what looms ahead , if you can eat today , enjoy today , mix good cheer with friends today enjoy it and bless god for it . everything in excess ! to enjoy the flavor of life , take big bites . moderation is for monks . compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us . beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy . those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order , will lose both and deserve neither . you can ' t be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline . it helps if you have some kind of a football team , or some nuclear weapons , but at the very least you need a beer . love is always bestowed as a gift - freely , willingly and without expectation . we don ' t love to be loved ; we love to love . who so loves believes the impossible . the eskimo has fifty - two names for snow because it is important to them ; there ought to be as many for love . love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within . hope is like a road in the country : there was never a road , but when many people walk on it , the road comes into existence . whatever our souls are made of , his and mine are the same . a book may lie dormant for fifty years or for two thousand years in a forgotten corner of a library , only to reveal , upon being opened , the marvels or the abysses that it contains , or the line that seems to have been written for me alone . in this respect the writer is not different from any other human being : whatever we say or do can have far - reaching consequences . a woman drove me to drink and i didn ' t even have the decency to thank her . never doubt that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world . indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . a positive attitude will not solve all your problems , but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort . i would like to believe when i die that i have given myself away like a tree that sows seed every spring and never counts the loss , because it is not loss , it is adding to future life . it is the tree ' s way of being . strongly rooted perhaps , but spilling out its treasure on the wind . you can widen your life by yourself , but to deepen it you need a friend . each encounter that becomes a friendship turns into a lifeline . one can never have too many , only too many to properly take care of . compassion is the antitoxin of the soul : where there is compassion even the most poisonous impulses remain relatively harmless . i ' d rather have a bottle in front of me , than a frontal lobotomy . autumn is the time when seasons merge because of bare necessity . a woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea . when a friend is in trouble , don ' t annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do . think up something appropriate and do it . reduce the complexity of life by eliminating the needless wants of life , and the labors of life reduce themselves . give me a woman who loves beer and i will conquer the world . always do sober what you said you ' d do drunk . that will teach you to keep your mouth shut . those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order , will lose both and deserve neither . no dictator , no invader , can hold an imprisoned population by force of arms forever . there is no greater power in the universe than the need for freedom . against that power , governments and tyrants and armies cannot stand . i discovered i always have choices and sometimes it ' s only a choice of attitude . opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work . your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life ; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens . drinking provides a beautiful excuse to pursue the one activity that truly gives me pleasure - - hooking up with fat , hairy girls .

2	Subject: updated email regarding netco process here ' s the updated email after responses from business and legal types : there have been several media reports this morning regarding the status of our efforts to preserve the value of our north american natural gas and power business . as we ' ve said , we ' d like to form a joint venture with an entity with a strong credit rating so that our trading business can continue to deliver value to our company and our creditors . we ' d like to update you on the timing of the process as we currently see it . this wednesday , december 19 th , we will ask the bankruptcy court to approve bid procedures for potential suitors to follow as they proceed to make offers for a joint venture . if we are successful , we will ask the judge to set a bid deadline of january 7 th , 2002 . at that point , we would review the bids with the creditors ' committee and , after a process to determine the best offer , we will jointly ask the bankruptcy court to approve the winning bid . additionally , we will continue to try to close a deal prior to january 7 th , which would then be subject to competitive bids form other counterparties . the number of counterparties interested in a deal continues to grow . between now and the bid deadline , we will continue to work with all interested parties and assist them in their respective due diligence processes so that they can make the most informed bids . many of our colleagues will be working very hard over the holidays to move this process along and help ensure our efforts to come out of bankruptcy are successful . please give them your full cooperation and support .

2	Subject: california update 3 / 27 / 01 executive summary : ? undercollet remains sticking point for utility creditors ( especially qfs ) , involuntary bankruptcy likely if issue is not addressed in today ' s capuc hearings ? capuc rate increase set at 40 % , pending dwr power purchase details ? davis defends no rate increase position , distances himself from capuc qf / generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy as reported last week , qf has sitting and waiting to hear what the capuc has to say , unfortunately it may not be what the qfs want to hear . the utilities ' undercollect , which will not be addressed in today ' s capuc hearings , could very well provide an invitation for qfs and generators to file involuntary bankruptcy against socal and pg & e . recent rate hikes proposed by the capuc specifically dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt , leaving the qf with little hope of recovery . qfs were obviously dismayed by the capuc ' s draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads , an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely . capuc holds rate increase hearings today as reported yesterday , loretta lynch released the details of the capuc ' s draft rate increase order last night . there is expected to be a 3 cent / kwh surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40 % rate increase . a portion of this " surcharge " will be given to the dwr to cover its costs and the order concludes that utilities need revenues on a going - forward basis . therefore , utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt ( ex . qfs ) . however , the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the qfs on a going - forward basis . the net effect of the order is to allow the utilities to operate in case of bankruptcy . one interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the utilities to join with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount overcharged for power by the generators . the suggestion is that the utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds . only the funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities ' past debt . if the utilities choose this course of action , it would be a very lengthy process . davis contends with lynch on capuc rate increases . davis has thus far refused to support capuc ' s proposed rate increase stating the capuc decision making board is an independent body and that he continues to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure . sources indicate that he is likely to ask for lynch ' s letter of resignation , however , there is no indication she will comply . senator burton , who supports the capuc ' s plan , reportedly will protect lynch by not allowing her to be impeached ( which is the only other way she could be removed by the governor ) .

( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a " blueprint " of eim major processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics , settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the " blueprint " , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and recommended systems . a complete " roadmap " should be laid out with a 0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan addresses tactical also . our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries . the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we ' d be happy to visit with you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let me know how to proceed . thanks again for your time . since i wasn ' t able to attend the controllers ' conference last 10 / 00 , i ' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch . brenda to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect subject : metals brenda as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals . in particular i promised info on a few areas : project q assessment a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals ( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were : q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil & coal . metals process tends towards buy > store > sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge 2 . inventory controls again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general . 3 . funding of inventory we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro to the issues faced . 4 . curve management process the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6 for the far east ) . the maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote . 5 . re recruitment of paper traders i haven ' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced paper . i ' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london . i ' d appreciate same for eim . regards andy

2	Subject: asalam , dear , i am mrs . suha arafat , the wife of yasser arafat , the palestinian leader who died recently in paris . since his death and even prior to the announcement , i have been thrown into a state of antagonism , confusion , humiliation , frustration and hopelessness by the present leadership of the palestinian liberation organization and the new prime minister . i have even been subjected to physical and psychological torture . as a widow that is so traumatized , i have lost confidence with everybody in the country at the moment . you must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the discovery of some fund in my husband secret bank account and companies and the allegations of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in my name of which i have refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt palestine government . in fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the government so far is in the tune of about $ 6 . 5 billion dollars . and they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life . i have deposited the sum of 21 million dollars with a security financial firm in whose name is withheld for now until we open communication . i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your bank account for safe keeping and investment opportunity . this arrangement will be known to you and i alone and all our correspondence should be strictly on email alone because our government has tapped all my lines and are monitoring all my moves . in view of the above , if you are willing to assist for our mutual benefits , we will have to negotiate on your percentage share of the $ 21 , 000 , 000 that will be kept in your position for a while pending when my daughter , zahwa , will come off age and take full responsibility of her family estate / inheritance . please , if you are honest , i am going to entrust more funds in your care as this is one of the legacy we keep for our children . in case you don ' t accept please do not let me out to the security and international media as i am giving you this information in total trust and confidence i will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith and send to me your complete personal contact information . may god bless you and your household . yours sincerely , madam suha . reply to : ssha _ 43 @ yahoo . it this email is send by " demo software "

" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . " prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , " said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . " but all that is out the window now . " deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . " you will see some cancellations and some delays , " predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . " most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , " he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in " patient but not passive , " the story that accompanies the list , " by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . " fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , " she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . " the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting , asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining . ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris 
2	Subject: get back to me mr . joshua nkosi , absa bank limited , johannesburg , south africa . dear sir , i am mr . joshua nkosi , manager of bills / exchange at the foreign remittance department of absa bank . in my department , we discovered an abandoned sum of us $ 14 , 700 , 000 . 00 ( fourteen million , seven hundred thousand united state dollars only ) in an account that belonged to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family , on november 1996 , in a ghastly plane crash , and he happened to be a foreigner . since we got the information about his death , we have been expecting his next - of - kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines . unfortunately , nobody has come forward to claim this money . it is based on this that some officials in my department and i have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you , hence by contacting you . we want you to present yourself as the next of kin through your relation with the deceased , so that the funds can be remitted into your account . moreover , we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills . the banking law and guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years , is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account . now , it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarterof 2005 , when nobody come forward to lay claims . the reason for requesting you to present yourself as next of kin , is occasioned by , the fact that the deceased ( customer ) was a foreigner , and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin . the mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account , shall be 70 % to my colleagues and i , for the role you will be expected to play in this deal , we have agreed to give you 25 % of the total sum and 5 % for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction . therefore , you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business . after receiving your reply , you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take . i expect your urgent response through my email address : joshuakosi @ maktoob . com . and i shall contact you for further discussion on this matter , to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch . please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in absa bank . personal regards , mr . joshua nkosi .

" she said these proposals ensure reliability and allow treasurer to issue bonds . continues to castigate ferc throughout the call . wants new appointments to ferc from the states - - " our cries have fallen on deaf ears " lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow : 1 . wood ' s proposal - - modified - - order that the ious to pay the qfs beginning 4 / 1 on a going forward basis only . modified existing formula in section 390 ( legislative change to this section did not pass yet ) . shifts the srac gas index from topoc ( where wood says the prices are being mnipulated ) to malin , where prices have been more stable . 2 . sets the ca procurement adjustment - - orders the ious to pay the dwr for purchases . at one point she said that the order would be for all power for purchased by the state beginning jan 19 ; at another point she said that the payments are for going forward costs . " it ' s time to pay the power bills for california . " cpa calculated based on the " residual " method , rather than the proportional method . payments to dwr made on the proportional method , however . 3 . lynch alternate setting a 3 cents / kwh increase in accordance with ab lx . ( the alj decision said no rate increase . ) makes the 1 cent temp charge permanent ( we believe that this is additive with the 3 cents - 4 cent total ) believe this covers all needs on a going forward basis . according to abx 1 , small customers with 130 % over baseline get no increase , small customers with 200 % increase , get a 9 % increase - - the rest get socked , i guess . adopted turn ' s accounting proposal implying that the rate freeze is not yet over . will look at rate design in a future proceeding . takes ious 30 - 45 days to charge the rates ( although could come earlier ) ; will conduct a rate design proceeding during that time period ( see # 5 ) . 4 . orders an investigation into the utility holding company structure to see if it is best for the public utilities to be outside holding companies . a new proceeding was also identified . 5 . lynch is issuing an assigned comissioner ruling proposing a new rate structure . ( i presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use ) need information from dwr to calculate rates and dwr has not yet provided it . described the need to have a record on this . as mentioned in # 3 above - - would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30 - 45 days . in one of the above orders , lynch said that she orders the utililities to go after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices .

( dutch , english , first price - sealed bid , and second - price sealed bid . ) in fact , the selling price is equal to the valuation of the second highest bidder . for example , in vickrey auction , everyone bids at his own valuation . hence , the winner pays the valuation of the second highest bidder . in english auction , the second highest valuation bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation . hence , the winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder . thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions . - chonawee

" [ t ] here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse , collusion and affiliate self dealing of out - of - state gas suppliers and merchants , " edison told the cpuc . the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section 5 complaint with ferc regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of " certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out - of - state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity . " it notes the complaint " conservatively estimates that the anti - competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged california gas and electricity users by $ 100 million annually since the beginning of 1998 . " edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of $ 4 . 5133 / mmbtu , which was applied to sce ' s august 2000 avoided cost posting , to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of october and every month going forward . it estimated september bidweek border prices would average $ 7 / mmbtu . if such prices were used in edison ' s september avoided costs posting , its transition formula payments to certain independent power producers will be $ 29 million more than the month prior , the company told the cpuc . " no mechanism exists to recapture the increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in another forum that the topock border indices are unreliable at this time . " - - 
2	Subject: re : move sally , the may 18 th date is locked in stone . we have already reserved seats on a continental flight @ noon thursday , may 18 . it ' s unfortunate that mark was not kept up to date , but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the may day riots . tom and i have been in constant contact and we have confirmed the move - out date . the book - split project will be implemented tomorrow and i will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book their deals and that risk is able to generate and explain the dpr on a timely basis . also , while i am here i plan to meet with the weather derivatives team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets . this project will not drag on day - by - day as mentioned below . there is much more that can be done , but that is out of the scope of this project ; besides i am ready to come home . have a good weekend , todd enron north america corp . from : sally beck 05 / 05 / 2000 11 : 46 am to : d todd hall / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : move fyi - sounds as if we can ' t delay tom ' s residence in the flat any longer . we have pushed the date several times . if there are some other delays , you may want to consider flying back with your family back to houston , and then returning on your own to finish the project . you could stay in a hotel from that time period . what do you think ? can we assure tom that you will be out of the flat by the 18 th of may ? - - sally - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by sally beck / hou / ect on 05 / 05 / 2000 11 : 42 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - enron capital i didn ' t realize you were not aware of the situation . richard , iain and i had agreed that it made sense for me and iain to overlap a week either in london or houston . since i had commitments in houston up through last week , we decided to overlap in houston and for me to start in london on may 8 th . sally beck then approached us about letting todd extend his stay in the flat an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he had his whole family with him , so we offered to push my move back one more week , to may 15 th . todd intended to be out of the flat by thursday , may 11 , but apparently his plans included working the last weekend of april . having lost that weekend since the london office was closed in anticipation of may day riots , he now wants to stay until thursday , may 18 . originally , he suggested that his family would probably return to the u . s . the week of may 8 th with or without him , so i had proposed that we finalize my plans around his leaving on may 11 , and he relocate to a hotel if he needed to stay longer . now , though , his family has decided to stick it out with him instead of returning early . unless somebody dictates an absolute move - out date to him , i guess we work around his * tentative * plan to vacate the flat by may 18 and we target may 22 as my start date in london . my only concern though , is that his project may continue to drag on day - by - day . tara needs two full working days to clean the flat , which means thursday and friday , which gives me saturday and sunday to move in .

2	Subject: re : please give sean long a ring since you are reading e - mails , i thought i would let you know how things went with ozzie . i met with him on saturday and made the proposal we discussed . he said he was interested and wanted to follow up with a conversation on resources and compensation . i would suggest flexibility on compensation and also help in getting additional resources . i would like , however for ozzie to recognize that he would be part of the team . this is critical to integrating and optimizing the market / opportunistic approach of the regions with the product approach of generation investments . i believe that the synergies ( terrible word i ' m sorry ) here could be substantial . if he wants to be autonomous i don ' t need him . he said he was meeting with you tomorrow . i ' ll call you on monday .

2	Subject: associate prc , martin lin dave , you are representing martin lin , an associate currently in the research group , at the mid - year prc . we would like to promote martin to a manager position in the research group , so you will need to nominate him for promotion at the prc meeting for us . martin has spent the last four months supporting ebs . his primary project has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of the media - cast product running on the ebs network . this type of analysis is critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in trying to service , for example , the blockbuster deal . martin has already come up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive contractor from lucent who is under contract to support this modelling effor . prior to supporting ebs , martin used his engineering skills ( b . s . caltech , ph . d . u . of texas in ee ) to create models of regional power transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion constraints . in our internal pre - ranking meeting we felt that martin was deserving of a rating of superior due to his technical excellence , his excellent attitude and work ethic , and his ability to move projects forward with minimal supervision . regards , stinson

2	Subject: book - split update 4 / 25 / 2000 as we are nearing the deadline for the book - split project , i want to give you a status update . book - split completed separate cash & term books have been setup in enpower and global databases for every country pablo pissanetzky has written code to successfully transfer over 99 % of the deals into their proper regional books two dozen deals ( mainly annuities ) have been modified in production to transfer according to pablo ' s code all deals requiring manual intervention on go live date have been identified initial position report has been developed and tested for accuracy uncompleted communication to commercial of positions ( wed . april 26 ) presentation of the position report which allows commercial to view monthly peak / off - peak volumes by region ( wed . april 26 ) pcs by deal for each portfolio separate dprs and associated reports for the pool and bilateral portfolios modifications necessary for the settlements invoicing system transmission we are making progress on this effort although you have not seen any hard evidence . zhiyong wei is the it director in houston who is responsible for enpower development . we are working with pablo and zhiyong on several possibilities . as we have previously discussed , there is not the current capability to value the spreads as options , but we are testing the other scenarios . buy / resale this deal type has been disabled we are waiting for zhiyong ' s response as to its future functionality if any transmission pablo tested in the stage environment today after receiving minor assistance from zhiyong ability to book transmission deal without annuity leg ability to liquidate demand charge daily reflects long and short positions at the appropriate regions ( as forwards not options ) does not value the forward spread between the regional curves ( still testing ) variable cost treatment is still being tested forwards if deep in the money , we could enter intra - desk / inter - desk deals to reflect positions and p & l much time and it development resources have been spent to make use of the transmission functionality . after speaking with zhiyong , there evidently was a big push last year for the mtm of transmission . the latest version has been in the test environment for some time , but no one is currently testing it . it will take some attention to test it properly and will not be complete by the book - split deadline . as we established in our last meeting , the mtm of transmission is a separate project from the book - split . due to the complexity and amount of data involved in the book - split project itself , it is advisable that we incorporate the transmission second . further testing of the transmission will continue this week and by the end of the week we should have a decision on the most effective way to currently book transmission . please call or come by if you have any questions , todd hall

2	Subject: message from ken lay earlier today , i stepped down as enron ' s chairman of the board and chief executive officer . this decision was reached in cooperation with enron ' s board and the creditor committee and is effective immediately . to emerge from bankruptcy , enron needs a ceo who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company . unfortunately , with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention , at this time i am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to enron ' s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees . the creditor committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim ceo to help the company emerge from bankruptcy . this individual will join enron ' s remaining management team to direct the company ' s ongoing operations . i truly believe enron can and will survive . i will remain a director of the board to help see that it does . during my time at enron , i have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity . i have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world ' s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks ; i have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets ; i have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like enrononline ; and i have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community . regardless of what has happened , i am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here . thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years . ken lay

2	Subject: request from : mr joe mark email fax : 1 561 619 2791 email : mrjoemark @ yahoo . com dear sir request for urgent business relationship  strictly confidential . firstly , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and  top secret .  though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you . so we decided it is best using the email . let me start by first introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . kaku opa , a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a three - man tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power . the duties of the committee also include evaluation , vetting and monitoring of work done by foreign and local contractors in the ministry . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . in order to commence this business , we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : between 1996 and 1997 , this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering , procurement , supply of electrical equipments such as transformers , and some rural electrification projects . however , these contracts were over - invoiced by the committee , thereby , leaving the sum of us $ 11 . 5 million dollars ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) in excess . this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved . the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts , leaving the balance of $ 11 . 5 m dollars , which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off - shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves . we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors . we are handicapped in the circumstances as the civil service code of conduct , does not allow us to operate off - shore accounts , hence your importance in the whole transaction . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount of us $ 11 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) , while 70 % will be for us ( members of this panel ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses incurred ( both local and foreign ) in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here , the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub - contracted it out to other companies . more often than not , big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts . we are civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a life time opportunity . you must however , note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below , as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts . we have decided that this transaction will be based completely on the following : ( a ) . our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence . ( b ) . that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality . ( c ) . that upon receipt of the funds , you will promptly release our share ( 70 % ) on demand after you have removed your 20 % and all expenses have been settled . ( d ) . you must be ready to produce us with enough information about yourself to put our minds at rest . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary information and requirement from you . endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email address mrjoemark @ yahoo . com . i will bring you into the complete picture of the transaction when i have heard from you . your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for this financial quarter . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , mr joe mark do you yahoo ! ? launch - your yahoo ! music experience http : / / launch . yahoo . com

( 3000 trades vs 1550 trades ) . * the only significant product offering difference between the two periods was the gd / d sumas product , which was offered in may - july , but not nov - jan . ( accounts for relatively few trades ) * enron north america did a higher percentage of the trading on canadian gas products in novo 0 - janol than they did during the earlier months . * there are a handful of counterparties such as murphy oil and dynegy marketing which conducted business with canada on eol before and since the nov - jan lull period , but did not do online transactions with us during the three months where our trade volumes and deal counts were lowest . torrey moorer enrononline product control group ( 713 ) 853 - 6218

" confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure . this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much , " said one analyst who asked not to be identified . the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday , bringing it to the attention of a wider audience , analysts said . lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts . as a result of the operation , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent , but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year , lay said . moody ' s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several enron businesses . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . brazil ' s copene , elektro plan to sell 820 mln reais of bonds 2001 - 10 - 18 13 : 53 ( new york ) rio de janeiro , oct . 18 ( bloomberg ) - - two brazilian companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell 820 million reais ( $ 279 million ) of bonds , raising the amount of pending local market bond sales to 7 . 5 billion reais . brazil ' s copene - petroquemica do nordeste sa , a petrochemical company , has asked brazil ' s government for permission to sell 625 million reais of bonds according to the country ' s security and exchange regulator , the cvm . banco citibank sa , the brazilian unit of citigroup inc . , will manage the sale . elektro eletricidade e servicos sa , an electricity utility controlled by u . s . - based enron corp . that distributes electricity in sao paulo state , has asked for permission to sell 195 million reais of bonds , according to a cvm filing . no further details about the sales was immediately available . brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as the local currency , the real , plunges against the dollar , making dollar - denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as the local currency value of dollar debts soars . so far this year , about 9 . 1 billion reais of local market debt has been sold . meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $ 1 . 7 billion in the third quarter from $ 4 . 5 billion in the second , not including sales through offshore subsidiaries , according to bloomberg data .

process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs . networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been requested . location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv . currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done . data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need . we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know who else will need access . interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface . there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete . scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition . accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started . hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer . please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy 
2	Subject: ees / epmi split i heard dave ' s voicemail . i appreciate his concern . however , i don ' t think that the delineation is easy to do . i am confident that my team knows what we are good at and what we aren ' t good at . if we aren ' t best suited to serve the load , we will act like " one enron " and send the account over to the them . the split should really be driven by the customer ' s needs and which utility they are behind . for example , montana power has a wonderful balancing tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares it to the actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalances . we don ' t do any metering , we don ' t do any unique billing , the loads range anywhere from 1 mw to 25 mw . ena is definitely best suited to serve these industrials because commodity price is their top interest . the pugest system is about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana ' s . ena will be very well positioned to serve this load . the same company could have a plant in california . we wouldn ' t serve that load because the expertise needed to manage the ctc risk ( before this thing blew up anyway ) , the challenge of metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs . actual basis , and the load forecasting . the same company could also own gas stations in the west . we have no interest in serving gas stations . i also heard the message attached to dave ' s from scott dann ( sp ? ) . his message did little to open communication between groups . he provided no details on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi ( ena ) and ees . for us to do this right , ees and ena need to be able to solve problems without involving the office of the chair of each company . i would be happy to work with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts . i still can ' t think of a clean way to divide customers . each approach has its problems . each company ( ees and ena ) has its strengths . our strength is commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid . their strength is in tariff analysis , energy management , and aggregating loads . for the west , i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any disputes with ees that are reasonable . we know what we are good at . we have a proven track record with a large number of industrials in the west . i still believe that our customers and shareholders are best served with our favored approach . it will require better communication on the operating level between ees and ena .

2	Subject: western update 8 / 20 / 01 market update a pair of new pacific northwest power plants is coming online this month . the klamath cogeneration project in klamath falls , oregon , will start feeding 486 mw of electricity to the region ' s power grid . an additional 270 mw are expected to come online this month from rathdrum power , a natural gas - fired plant near rathdrum , idaho . all told , nearly 1 , 240 new mw of power are expected to be buzzing through the region ' s grid by the end of the year , marking the first major steps toward erasing the northwest ' s estimated 3 , 000 mw power deficit . aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s ) alcoa aluminum alcoa ' s intalco smelter are negotiating with individuals within bc hydro to serve as an alternate electricity seller . bc hydro individuals are kelly lail , manager of resourcement management , ray olegaard ( title unknown at this time ) ; and mike costello , president and chief operating officer of bc hydro . there is considerable interest by wall street analysts regarding this deal , which has implications on both the aluminum and electricity industries . this interest is making it more difficult than it ordinarily would be to get information on this target , but we will continue to research this . kaiser aluminum kaiser aluminum is still on the ' outs ' with bpa after having been the worst bidder in the load reduction agreement sweepstakes a few weeks ago . power prices will have to continue sliding into the low - to - mid $ 30 ' s before kaiser will be able to resume smelting operations . we are still under the belief that kaiser is bringing back employees to its smelters in an effort to realize ' shareholder value ' to affect potential m on the other hand , california claims that bc hydro was part of the scheme of market manipulation and $ 8 . 9 billion in overcharges by energy suppliers . it looks like the minister of energy , richard neufeld , and others are favoring a plan to work out a financing plan or a way to forgive california of the $ 290 million debt . recent estimates indicate that at current power generation levels , british columbia will be a net importer of electricity in 2007 . officials are looking to put together an extensive plan that will combine off - shore drilling , a streamlined bc hydro , and improved us - canadian natural gas and oil transmission pipelines with a look toward alleviating this growing need . under the bc liberal administration , alternative power sources such as wind power are unlikely to receive much attention - indeed , neufeld has already moved to downplay the cost - effectiveness of wind and solar power , a clear indication that fossil fuels will play a considerable role in the future of bc energy activities . bc hydro bc hydro has selected a new chairman and ceo , larry bell . upon taking the position , bell was immediately hit with a blizzard of criticism from the remnants of the ndp on the left . mr . bell is currently sweeping bc hydro with a mandate to deregulate segments of the business - at least two major areas of hydro operations are now looking like they will be farmed out to the private sector : information technology and transmission lines . our contacts have suggested that potential bidders for hydro ' s transmission system are beginning to put their bids together due to the rapidity with which bell is expected to move . it is likely that bell will look to maintain hydro ' s core business of power generation and keep powerex , the trading arm , of the organization . bpa spill - related issues bpa reservoirs are currently at 58 . 2 maf , far below the 100 maf that is typical for this time of year , but enough to meet current bpa load requirements . bonneville has not been aggressively spilling water for salmon this summer ; they anticipate their decision not to spill , coupled with load reduction agreements with dsi ' s , have put them on solid footing for this winter . however , we should not expect bpa to be moving to secure any new contractual agreements soon ( it is more likely that they want to get out of existing contracts ) . ed mosey , spokesman for bpa has said , " we are in pretty good shape . we ' ll have enough water to meet our firm load requirements , but there won ' t be any surplus to sell .

2	Subject: re : marketpoint license agreement dale , thanks for your message . in our phone conversation before the meeting you mentioned another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company employees on a case - study . the cost of a weekly project would be $ 12 , 000 that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software . this project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model internally . please , let me know more about this option . we are primarily interested in a long - term natural gas model and the database for north america . unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite , we don ' t have resources to spend too much time on it . of course , a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model . i shall talk to them about it . vince " dale m . nesbitt " on 11 / 13 / 2000 06 : 00 : 05 pm to : , " vince . j . kaminski " cc : subject : marketpoint license agreement john / vince : i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people . as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire bundled product , which includes ? north american gas , short and long term ? north american electricity , short and long term ? world gas ? western european gas ? world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business . as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under the fully bundled price . i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward . ) i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business . if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar . our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar . thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later . thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted . dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc . 27121 adonna ct . los altos hills , ca 94022 ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com - license . doc

2	Subject: kinder morgan puts additional assets in the mlp kinder morgan transfers $ 300 m in assets to mlp kinder morgan , inc . announced plans to contribute $ 300 million in assets to kinder morgan energy partners , l . p . , the company ' s master limited partnership . the largest asset to be contributed is kinder morgan texas pipeline , formerly midcon texas , a 2 , 600 - mile natural gas pipeline system that extends from south texas to houston along the texas gulf coast . other assets include the casper and douglas gas gathering and processing systems , kmi ' s 50 % interest in coyote gas treating and kmi ' s 25 % interest in thunder creek gas services . as consideration for the assets , kmi will receive $ 300 million , 50 % in cash and 50 % in kmp partnership units . kmi expects the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter . " this transaction represents a true win - win for both kmi and kmp , " said kinder morgan ceo rich kinder . " it is expected to be accretive to cash available for distribution to kmp ' s unitholders by between 5 - 10 cents in 2001 . the pipeline assets are a good fit for kmp because they complement existing kmp assets , have long - term contracts in place and offer significant growth opportunities . " kinder noted that because the mix of consideration paid will include equity issued to kmi , it will not be necessary to raise funds for the transaction via a public offering of kmp units . " kmi will also benefit from the transaction , as it will be able to reduce its debt by $ 150 million , " kinder said . " additionally , the transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to kmi ' s earnings per share in 2001 . by increasing its stake in the master limited partnership , kmi will enjoy greater participation in the expected future growth of kmp . " upon closing , kmp will have completed in excess of $ 600 million of acquisitions in 2000 . in addition , this transaction will boost kmi ' s total asset contribution to kmp to more than $ 1 billion , far exceeding the original goal stipulated when kinder morgan merged with kn energy last july .

2	Subject: ees operational risk per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers . briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes . if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of ees operational risk . briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains , then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info . if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a " proof of concept " excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else . another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment ( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of improvement . if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six weeks . finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets . he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway . - kevin k . ps : the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays . jay hachen will know more .

2 times ? 3 or more . . ? in addition to quest ' s oi | and gas exploration and production , technoiogy is another significant focus of the company . the acquisition and development of technology related to the exploration and production of oi | and gas is a vita | element of quest oi | ' s business , and plays central role in our operations . the roie of technoiogy in the oi | and gas market is critica | and provides a strategic advantage to the future of quest oil . quest oi | corporation was carefuily deveioped through determination and hard work . by evaluating our risks , and maintaining a strict ethica | standard . the quest team has successfuliy provided exceilent vaiue to our sharehoiders . we have assembied a world ciass team of personne | , who in turn have helped to create a highiy charged atmosphere of success . as a result , quest has been abie to attract as we | | as retain some of the top peopie in the oil gas industry . our commitment to a sound ethical code of conduct refiects a beiief in the fundamenta | principles of honesty , | oyalty , fairness and forthrightness that is shared throughout this organization . already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overal | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and deveiopers like ( qoil ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns . our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued qoil shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this small company with a comparably smail market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oi | and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with the daiiy jump in energy prices . but a | | that will change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive effect on the share price . what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of quest oi | s ' shares ? we | | we do know this - the great thing about investing in qoil is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or deciine slightiy , you wil | still make a very healthy return . of course , energy prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year or so as predicted , meaning the value of qoil ' s assets and earnings wi | | soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be staggering . overa | | , we consider qoil to be one of the | ast outstanding energy plays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized , qoil shares wil | surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . qoil ' s oi | and gas reserves are weil estabiished and are going into massive production . early investors will secure optimum gains , and any additional news in this area wil | rea | | y turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets upward in next week ' s bu | | etin . oil and gas advisory ( oga ) is not a investment expert . certain statements contained in this newsietter may be future - looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . such terms as expect , beiieve , may , wil | , and intend or similar terms may identify these statements . past - performance is not an indicator of future - results . this is not an expert to acquire or seil securities . oga isan independent publication that was paid fifteen thousand doliars by a third party for the continuing coverage and dissemination of this company information . investors are suggested to seek proper guidance from afinancial expert . investors shouid use the information provided in this newsietter as a starting point for gathering additiona | information on the profiled company to allow the investor to form their own opinion regarding investment . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you fee | you have been wrongfuliy placed in our membership , piease go here or send a blank e mail with no thanks in the subject to ( - stock 24 @ yahoo . com - )

this is critical to your success . * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but let ' s just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s 100 people who responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each  $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total  $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report .            available reports                     the reason for the " cash " is not because this is illegal or somehow " wrong " . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : " the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net " order report # : 1 from rui sousa santos p . o . box 132 taylors lakes vic 3038 australia report # 2 : " the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net " order report # 2 from : richard moulton p . o . box 82 hot springs , mt 59845 usa report # 3 : " secret to multilevel marketing on the net " order report # 3 from : j . siden krondikesvägen 54 a 83147 östersund sweden report # 4 : " how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net " order report # 4 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 5 : " how to send out one million emails for free " order report # 5 from : m . j . lee p . o . box 19 52 victoria drive london swl 9 6 bd united kingdom $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :    if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do .    after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now !

" mitchell wolf m . d . , chicago , illinois " not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative as i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back . i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders . i made $ 319 , 210 . 00 in the first 12 weeks . the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live . there simply isn ' t a better investment with a faster return and so big . " dan sondstrom , alberta , canada " i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e - mailed again by someone else . . . . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again . . . . . . i did not delete this one ! i made more than $ 490 , 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks .

" that ' s why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! " with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided " why not . " initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip - off " anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . here is the basic version of what you need to do : your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do . your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2 within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off , keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build . keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it wasn ' t working . finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to " move up " or " get rich " . inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! " think about it . " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say " no way ! " please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps " a " through ' g " or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 . d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy and paste method works well , . 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of participants . think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number , and name * * * * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of those sheets of paper include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e - mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider encounters problems ) . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 " the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the internet " order report # 1 from : randy dillard p . o . box 8 osprey , fl 34229 usa report # 2 " the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the internet " order report # 2 from : carla brown p . o . box 39093 sarasota , fl 34238 usa report # 3 " the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet " order report # 3 from : glynn schmidt p . o . box 19424 sarasota , fl 34276 usa report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet " order report # 4 from : christin joy cpo 2398 501 e . college avenue wheaton , il 60187 usa report # 5 " how to send one million e - mails for free .

2	Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege ) shirley : as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski . the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) . and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) . background the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread . utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines . inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin . for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range . ege objectives ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant . i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) . ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition . iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized . specific ege concepts ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities . it produces indicative statistics such as : a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ; b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ; c . the frequency distribution of load level ; d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ; e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ; f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ; g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) . indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years . ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 . ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units . other ege supporting data : i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ; j . actual maximum generating capacity ; k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ; l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range . with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters . the real - world example of allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy . another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy . offering of energy leader consulting ( elc ) ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities . elc transfers its " knowledge " about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process : 1 . enron would select one to three target utilities . 2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities . 3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) . 4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron . the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered . steven a . mitnick chief executive officer energy leader consulting 4807 41 st street , nw washington , dc 20016 ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax smitnick @ energyleader . com
