mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 . i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came straight to mit for a ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics , optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran , and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my phd thesis is " pricing substitute products on the internet " , and i am sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about . thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week . paulo pricing substitute products on the internet objective : to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet . motivation : this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices . furthermore , companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to . the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g . vcrs or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about . the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services . research strategy : our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these components are choice models and optimization models . choice models : choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains . these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models . the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet . optimization : traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component ( learning ) .

[ probably not what they teach in flight attendant school as the optimal response , but . . . . . . ] in any event , i appreciate the info below and would appreciate any additional info this message may lead you to . i ' d love to know whether or not the adrenaline surge was warranted . best regards - max louise kitchen @ ect 03 / 28 / 2001 10 : 30 am to : max yzaguirre cc : subject : re : on a plane - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by louise kitchen / hou / ect on 03 / 28 / 2001 10 : 29 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : andy zipper / enron @ enronxgate on 03 / 28 / 2001 10 : 10 am to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect cc : david forster / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : on a plane a vor is the standard instrument for navigating an aircraft under an ifr flight plan . it is the receiver that allows the plane to be flown on bearings from ground stations . if it were to fail there would be loads of backups , although if you are on a scheduled flight their operations manual would dictate that the flight be terminated as soon as practicable in the event any primary component , such as this were to fail . where were you that you were able to monitor the performance of this instrument ? the flight deck ? az - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kitchen , louise sent : wednesday , march 28 , 2001 9 : 15 am to : zipper , andy ; forster , david subject : on a plane if it shows vor 2 failure - any idea what that is ? it was a 737 .

2	Subject: re : limit violations and notifications process shona - rac and risk ops are in this together and of course we ' ll continue to help in understanding the violations . i recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems , the uk dpr issues , the increased limit change and policy compliance activity , etc . . my suggestions were : 1 ) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier , 2 ) i was offering to " be the bad guy " and point out to the traders what we want them to do , and 3 ) meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits . i think the confusion here is violation explanations being " validated " by the traders as you indicated below , vs . " provided " by the traders as we envision . i confirmed with ted , the traders are accountable for providing the explanation . i ' m not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier . we ' re suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning , so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now , of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations . it should be the traders responsibility to get them to you , and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading . , and should be able to easily explain why they ' re in violation or why they had a big loss . whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail , or they talk to their ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you - whatever you think makes sense and works for you . i ' m not trying to manage the process , just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point . at this point in this long series of e - mails , why don ' t we just talk face to face . i can tell from your response you feel we ' re somehow not being team players , but that is not my intent at all . i ' ve tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much market risk values and appreciates your efforts . and really , i thought i was helping by using the policy ' s influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting . perhaps a meeting with you and i and sally would be appropriate . we can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with rac ' s expectations . i agree , we do have significant mid - office needs , and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since i joined rac ; and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by skilling . we can continue to work on streamlining processes , but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities . i ' m willing to do whatever is needed , and i don ' t think ted is hung up on who does what either . it ' s just that right now we ' re staffed with the expectation that sally ' s group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems . best regards , cassandra . -

to share with the others our telephone discussion , the notification template was not my request , it was requested directly by skilling . i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations , and in accordance with your request below , market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements . the new p / l notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications , so that should help . it probably makes sense to re - distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements . another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations . these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group . under the policy , that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility , along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group . if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ( ops desk head / business unit controller ) , i ' ll be happy to send them an e - mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy . why don ' t you talk to each of the business unit controllers , consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback ( as i understand it is for global products , for example ) , and if you ' d like me to send an e - mail to whoever you ' re having difficulty with , i will - just let me know who . our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations , but the problem is , they can see whether they ' re short or long and how the market moved in comparison , but it ' s the trader that can and should explain why they took a position , whether they ' re adjusting it based on the market moves , etc . . let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process . regards , cassandra . -

comments i realize this has already gone out , but i see a few errors that we should correct - and actually , i think we should call skilling and lay ' s ( and buy ' s ) assistants ( veronica will handle this ) and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning , e - mail is ok for ted , david and i . i have a few other suggestions on format / reporting changes as well . the na power var of $ 51 mm was not 105 % over its var limit of $ 50 - that would have been $ 52 . 5 to require a report to skilling , ( but if we had had to report it , don ' t use " wscc " , try to spell out or just don ' t use ) uk gas ' s var limit is not $ 4 , it ' s $ 7 . 5 mm i can ' t tie in uk gas ' qtd and ytd p / l - shouldn ' t it be what ' s on the dpr , adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call over to that yeo person and get the info . from them please the 2 nd item for na gas shouldn ' t be listed like that as it looks like another violation - the comment re : the var increase was mean to go at the bottom under rac comments the finance committe chairman notification for agg . var is not 100 % , it ' s 115 % ( notification requirement box ) ees had a var violation - $ 7 . 5 vs . 7 - that is a skilling level violation let ' s have the " re : " say " limit violations and notifications for december 5 , 2000 " let ' s number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level veronica will call you to coordinate re - distribution . going forward , we need to increase our level of review for these as they ' re getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk . thank you , cassandra . - - - - -

2	Subject: hgpl and kgpl - 3 rivers gas based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the items below , please be sure to call me asap . 1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on the purchase deal . 2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12 ( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately . 3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible . i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing these changes effective feb . lst . stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 , based on the swing parameters that you have been using . thank you .

2	Subject: el paso assignment of contracts may come up again later wood signals that el paso ' s fr contracts are high on agenda ferc denied rehearing of a june order that permits arizona public service co . to assign its full - requirements ( fr ) capacity contract on el paso natural gas to affiliate pinnacle west energy to serve a new gas - fired generation facility that it is building in arizona . on the surface , it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved . however , chairman pat wood made it very clear that he has concerns about fr service on el paso , which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates , and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date . " i will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing , but [ i ] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns " on el paso , wood said wednesday during a marathon commission meeting , the first over which he presided [ cpol - 90 , rpo 0 - 336 ] . the proper forum for discussion of the fr service will be el paso ' s order 637 proceeding , he noted . as a lawyer , " it ' s hard for me . . . to find an excuse to grant rehearing here . because this is not the appropriate docket to do that , i will concede that after four months of being browbeat into submission . . . that sometimes you ought to fold up , " wood said . " but i remain concerned about the [ interplay ] on the pipeline that if we don ' t engage in some long - term planning , " the situation could " lead to a bedsore for the customers out there in the southwest . " the new chairman made clear that he was not " a fan or supporter of 10 - year rate freezes or any extended rate freezes " that are made available to certain fr customers . " i understand that there ' s a tremendous disincentive here because of that for needed expansions to occur , " wood noted . he openly invited parties to challenge at the commission the limits of fr service . he noted that fr customers " seem to have an unbounded upper - end , which i would love the opportunity to [ address ] if we ever get a contested pleading to define exactly just how full full - requirements can be . " the " interplay " of frozen rates and unlimited access to pipeline capacity in a " growth part of the country that needs to have generation [ makes for ] a very complicated pipeline scenario , " wood said . in the june order , ferc gave the go - ahead for el paso to construct and operate two delivery points and about six miles of lateral pipeline to provide service to the proposed gas - fired electric generation facilities of pinnacle west and duke energy maricopa llc in maricopa county , az . pinnacle ' s 2 , 120 mw redhawk power plant will require about 410 mmcf / d of gas , while duke ' s 1 , 000 mw arlington valley plant will burn 210 mmcf / d . both plants have scheduled in - service dates of june 1 , 2002 . major producers and other el paso shippers attacked el paso ' s plan to provide fr service of 410 mmcf / d to the redhawk plant , arguing that the service would further constrain an already capacity - tight el paso system . specifically , they objected to el paso ' s plan to assign the fr contract ( 66 , 042 mmbtu / d ) of arizona public service to affiliate pinnacle west energy , as well as give a " huge increase " in the contract amount in order to serve the redhawk plant . the protestors further argued that the plan would give pinnacle west energy a competitive rate advantage over existing contract - demand customers on the pipeline .

2	Subject: re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00 ted , question 1 ) the investments in calme and apachi are booked on an accrual basis . i have had several meetings with commercial and accounting representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are effectively reinvested back into the assets . therefore , the market values that are reflected on the mpr are actually book values . the book values are typically adjusted the last week of the month and are 1 month behind as the internation groups wait until the gl is closed before communicating the updated values . question 2 ) thanks for the heads - up on india . i spoke with sheila glover and we are now aware of the details behind rediff . com . we need to ensure that these positions are not accounted for on the dpr by india so that we do not double - report the p & l . the long - term solution is to establish a communication line for future investments . between sheila , donna lowry , and i we can develop a plan . question 3 ) the 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by jeff kinneman for jim easter . during our last conversation , jim told jeff that these are strategic investments and should not be reflected on the mpr . there is still some uncertainty / confusion as to when an investment is classified as merchant . we could insist that all publically traded investments not included in the equity books would qualify . having said that , i would like to know if the gas authority of india , ltd ( gail ) and europe ' s investment in mg are considered to be merchant investments . i will be on vacation this friday and all of next week so please include david maxwell on any responses . david and i will stay in touch so as to make adjustments as needed . thanks , todd from : ted murphy 06 / 22 / 2000 03 : 07 pm to : d todd hall / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , rick buy subject : re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00 mr . hall , i have just reviewed the merchant portfolio summary for 6 / 20 and have the following questions : 1 ) calme shows an asset of $ 291 . 9 mm and apachi shows an asset of $ 113 . 0 mm and they show no p & l for the year is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums and commodity prices ? 2 ) india recently invested in an ipo ( rediff . com ) for which there was a simultaneous dash to buy and sell ( sounds like a merchant deal ) . where does this show up ? 3 ) there are several bonds ( publicly traded , registrered securities , housed in our prime broker accounts ) owned by various enron entities that i do not believe are on the dpr . shouldn ' t they be ? and if so , who is deciding not to include ? pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do . thanks ted from : d todd hall 06 / 21 / 2000 01 : 16 pm to : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , andrea v reed / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , carol jean marshall / hou / ect @ ect , raymond bowen / hou / ect @ ect , jeff skilling / corp / enron @ enron , jeff donahue / hou / ect @ ect , l ' sheryl hudson / hou / ect @ ect , monica reasoner / hou / ect @ ect , hope vargas / hou / ect @ ect , adarsh vakharia / hou / ect @ ect , joseph w sutton @ enron , michael s galvan / hou / ect @ ect , maria lebeau / hou / ect @ ect , wes colwell / hou / ect @ ect , mark frevert / na / enron @ enron , thomas myers / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00

2	Subject: many dear vince , 1 . i apologize for not having got back to karla earlier but dauphine is not properly equipped yet . 2 . the conference with samuelson , merton , heath , ross , mckean etc was spectacular . 512 academics and practitioners came to college de france and were very grateful . 3 . i was so worn out afterwards that i did not make it to houston . i just went to visit alex after a week conference on quantitative risk management where i was speaking at carnegie mellon 4 . another former phd student of mine has been testing and improving the software . he is great and modest ; giving the papers i referee and the conferences i go to , i do believe that we are still ahead ( or way ahead ) today . we also beautifully simplified the valuation of the hourly swings . obviously , in case of a problem , my reputation and your esteem would be more valuable than 30 % of 90 , 000 usd ( to be shared . . . ) 5 . i declined risk in houston and newyork and am not sure i will have the pleasure to see you in london . in all cases , we should coordinate for paris soon helyette

" breakthrough " products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons . another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors . significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today . vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade . another analogy is the flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business . in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the " flashlight battery " - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each . vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east . intellectual property protected with patents vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources . vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc . for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office . " fabless " business model enables cost - effective growth fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips , then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies , ranked by market capitalization , include $ 12 billion market cap , broadcom ( brcm ) press here to view $ 11 billion market cap , marvell semiconductor ( mrvl ) press here to view $ 9 billion market cap , xilinx ( xlnx ) press here to view $ 7 . 3 billion market cap , altera ( altr ) press here to view $ 4 . 5 billion market cap , nvidia corp ( nvda ) press here to view $ 4 . 4 billion market cap , sandisk corp ( sndk ) press here to view $ 3 billion market cap , ati technologies ( atyt ) press here to view ( other technologies products to be discussed in future analyst report updates ) vspc expects to use emerging computational , rf , imaging and nanosensor technologies to drive market growth by enabling gps - free navigation , especially for where gps doesn ' t work - - a top dod priority ; automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging - - for homeland security applications ; and identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons . when appropriate we will also provide updates on projects currently under review , which include a water purification technology and interactive radio . management chief executive officer : dr . carl kukkonen , ceo and founding partner . prior to founding viaspace technologies llc , dr . kukkonen was director of the center for space microelectronics technology ( csmt ) and manager of supercomputing at the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , ca . at jpl , dr . kukkonen managed several technologies and technical teams , including the technical foundation of viaspace ' s operating subsidiaries . among his major accomplishments , dr . kukkonen built the center for space microelectronics into a 250 man operation with a $ 70 m annual budget from nothing over the course of his 14 -

" viaspace overview viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce . viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems . viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories . the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk . viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate . in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power . viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors ( press to go to site ) , qwip technologies ( press to go to site ) , and vialogy corp ( press to go to site ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - and on new high technology opportunities . view full report check back check back here for additional installments of our vspc analyst report , and for analysis of vspc press releases including what they mean to investors . view full report view full report to join market movers mailings press here to find out more . 2400 lincoln ave altadena , ca 91001 safe harbor statement this information is a paid advertisement . any views expressed herein are provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as an offer , an endorsement , or inducement to buy or sell securities . bronks communications , inc .

2	Subject: re : possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana russell , thanks for the update . can you provide a rough quote / schedule to kit out the louisiana space for 130 people - please contact lillian carroll to get an exact count . we don ' t need recorded phones . also please lay out a schematic of the hardware configuration between enron , louisiana and aep ' s offices for this solution . deborah , can you provide lillian with a floor plan so that she can start locating the hpl staff by function . also , what do you recommend regarding furniture ? we should be able to come up with an interim solution based on the space coming available in 3 allen or any additional furniture we have in warehouses or in the louisiana bldg . your thoughts on cost for this ? once we have a plan / schedule i will follow up with aep to let them know of our plans . they already know we are headed in this direction , given their delay in leasing space . regards , brian from : russell long / enron @ enronxgate on 03 / 14 / 2001 06 : 54 pm to : brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : tommy yanowski / enron @ enronxgate , louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect , philippe a bibi / enron @ enronxgate , vincent fox / enron @ enronxgate , keith dziadek / enron @ enronxgate , jim coffey / hou / ect @ ect , deborah bubenko / epsc / hou / ect @ ect , paul foust / epsc / hou / ect @ ect , robert humlicek / enron @ enronxgate , jeffrey vincent / enron @ enronxgate , andrew hawthorn / enron @ enronxgate , heather a johnson / enron @ enronxgate subject : possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows : most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers . as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants . one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from . there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 . if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule . the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent . this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space . robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added . in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center . russell s . long enron net works , llc russell . long @ enron . com ( 713 ) 345 - 3754

( yes - apologies if there is confusion ) with regard to a global message , i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities . with these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide . these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations . i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across . agreed - but the note was targeted at europe - would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and shona ) finally , a question regarding timing . the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( shona took this to do after brent ' s return to houston ) for comments to all business controllers . i don ' t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards . and not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards . my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year . there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report . shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this , and i believe that mike has already been working with james new . so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against . would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ? can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to shona sorry that this response looks so long . i have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so i hope that it makes sense . thanks for sharing this with me . since you asked for input , i hope that you don ' t mind that i gave you some . - - sally - certainly not - and thanks mike jordan 09 / 26 / 2000 08 : 14 am to : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : a note being sent out under john sherriff ' s name - your thoughts on the cover note ? fernley / sally off and on ( with jackie gentle ' s help ) i have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ) . we are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash ( the enron europe newsletter ) have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ? mike

( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years . ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 . ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units . other ege supporting data : i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ; j . actual maximum generating capacity ; k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ; l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range . with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters . the real - world example of allegheny energy allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy . another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy . offering of energy leader consulting ( elc ) ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities . elc transfers its " knowledge " about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process : 1 . enron would select one to three target utilities . 2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities . 3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) . 4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron . the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered . steven a . mitnick chief executive officer energy leader consulting 4807 41 st street , nw washington , dc 20016 ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax smitnick @ energyleader . com

2	Subject: the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun 03 / 07 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution . virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery . it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees , suppliers and customers . but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average , double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months , companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ? the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems . there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files . next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs . businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan . network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years , are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network . instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross - platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments . many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment . this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management , it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues . ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in real - world environments . to contact amy larsen decarlo : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . she focuses on storage management , application management , and security . in her position , she oversees market research and contributes to custom project work in her focal coverage areas . prior to joining ema , amy spent five years covering enterprise management for industry trade magazines , including informationweek and data communications . she can be reached at mailto : decarlo @ . com for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com the national storage industry consortium ( nsic ) http : / / www . nsic . org the distributed management task force ( dmtf ) http : / / www . dmtf . org storage systems standards working group of the ieee http : / / www . ssswg . org the ietf http : / / www . ietf . org subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

2	Subject: wavescribe international ready for rapid growth ! otc bargains wavescribe international corporation otcbb : wsbl ob current share price - 0 . 06 outstanding - 10 million the right choice for the smart investor wavescribe international corporation is a national and international dictation and transcription product and service solutions provider for the document production / transcription industry . wavescribe has several divisions to address industry - specific demands for such specialties as healthcare , med - legal , education and entertainment . wavescribe offers the first web - based transcription software that was designed , developed , and deployed by transcriptionists . documents created through wavescribe have a 128 - bit security encryption , hippa and privacy law compliance . access to a medical or legal transcribed document for editing , reprints , updates , 24 hours a day in a simplified and cost - effective manner to handle the task of document control is now available . the wavescribe platform requires no software to purchase , and installation on to a specific pc is not needed . the transcriptionist utilizing the platform can use several methods to create documents such as uploading existing documents and / or formats while maintaining the traditional methods of transcription such as analog tapes , digital tapes , handheld devices , phone in rerecorded or pushed and even computer generated methods . in addition , future advances include speech - to - text and net / web ( documents created on a private network automatically stored and accessible on the internet platform ) " the future of word processing / document production will require no software , no installation , no upgrades and will be easy to learn . documents will be databased and searchable . access to files can be limited to an individual or given to staff anywhere in the world . production groups can create documents from handwritten paper or varying dictation sources . it will be an internet - based platform with documents available online . it will change the way we create , access , edit , manage , and archive volume documentation , " says wavescribe president cris bahar , " and we believe that the wavescribe software reflects this future . " " mt ' s love using wavescribe because they find it easier than ever to access voice files thereby increasing their productivity and their income , " added wavescribe president cris bahar . " transcription companies and end user clients love wavescribe because it gives them unprecedented control of their transcription process and total accountability . " because of demonstrated need for this type of product and the shortcomings of current industry services and methods , the target markets for this application are broad , extensive and lucrative and include the medical , legal , research , entertainment , and educational industries ; anyone that works with a large volume of documents . transcription services offered across a broad spectrum have included web conferences , special events , speeches , corporate meetings , business plans , lectures , interviews , resumes and educational documents . the size of individual target markets varies significantly , however , as an example , the medical transcription industry is estimated at approximately six billion dollars , and the legal transcription industry is estimated at more than twice the size of medical . wavescribe international ( pink sheets : wsbl ) , providers of on - demand internet word processor wavescribe , continues to emphasize the importance and size of the medical transcription market . recently , speech recognition solution provider scansoft ( nnms : ssft ) acquired the transcription platform provider medremote in a deal valued at more than $ 12 million in stock and cash . the healthcare industry spends approximately $ 15 billion annually on transcription production . wavescribe understands the magnitude of this and seeks to capture at least 1 % of this growing market , translating into at least $ 150 million in annual revenue . wavescribe president and ceo cris bahar stated , " we understand why scansoft would make this move . it ' s a natural course for them to pursue and validates what we have said for quite some time . wavescribe continues to stress the importance of the medical transcription industry in our on - demand world . hence , wavescribe ' s on - demand word processing platform and services encompass the medical transcription industry in addition to other fields that require mass document processing such as general business , legal and lectures on a global basis rather than only u . s . based .

2	Subject: revised : organizational changes to : enron north america corp . from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets , and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering  b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries . downstream coverage / origination as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals , plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering : a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision of paper risk management products ; b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries ; c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles and glass manufacturing industries . midstream coverage / origination a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this group ; b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ; c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern interconnect ; d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair , formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join this newly formed business . 2 ) commercial transactions : the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical analysis and upstream asset management . the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership , execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions : a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination . b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining , environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks . c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks . d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend . ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together . we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups . please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north america by working with us to implement these changes .

2	Subject: re : tech services louise , i ' m ok with that arrangement , without the dotted line reporting relationship between the members of the ena tech services group and the wholesale group . otherwise , my role is somewhat superfluous and cloudy at best . we can still achieve the same result by brian and i working together . brian louise kitchen 03 / 15 / 2001 09 : 55 am to : brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : tech services but isn ' t the point that its only a dotted line just like joe deffner has a dotted line to andy fastow . i can ' t see them as getting worried over a dotted line . i notice the one alternative you have not mentioned is leaving it as it is today with it all reporting to you and you managing any relationship with brian - what do you think ? louise brian redmond 03 / 14 / 2001 09 : 16 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : tech services louise , i had a brief chat with mark regarding his plans for enron wholesale tech services . as i understand him , he sees the ena tech services group reporting into brian stanley on a dotted line basis in order to keep these groups coordinated . you may want to first discuss / sell this reporting relationship with the origination units who will fear another ee & cc . further , we will have to sell this organizational structure to the members of the ena tech services group . i ' m concerned that we may loose some of our top engineers who will resist being organizationally tied to eas . two possible alternative arrangements : 1 . the ena tech services group remains as ena ' s development engineering organization . it should be regionalized and report ( on a solid line ) to the origination groups . this will keep the ena tech services group lean and mean and somewhat independent from the wholesale tech services group : a ) bob virgo / mike coleman would report into presto / durhan , b ) wayne mayes and his team would report into calger . c ) mike coleman would report into max and would help support esa , d ) nick cocavessis would support the gas and liquids businesses e ) ron blackham would support enron south america brian stanley ' s group would be seen as a technical resource base to draw from , and as a " friendly " check on the technical assumptions that are used in the pro formas . brian stanley ' s group would provide a review of enron america ' s dash ' s so as to keep the ena tech services group from becoming too aggressive in its assumptions ( whereas brian ' s group will tend to be over - conservative in its role as risk manager ) . 2 . another alternative is to create a broader role for the commercial investment / asset management group that you , dick and i spoke about . this unit would combine the skill sets of the restructuring group and the tech services group . it would have the technical responsibility for ena transactions throughout their life cycle and would have commercial responsibility for investments and assets that no longer have strategic or ongoing financial value to the origination groups . specifically : a ) investments and assets that were not projected to earn their cost of capital b ) investments and assets that had little or no strategic value c ) troubled assets / positions / investment that required significant time / attention beyond what the origination groups were willing to spend as with suggestion ( 1 . ) above , this group would use brian stanley ' s organization as a resource base to draw from on an as needed basis , however , there would not be a formal reporting relationship . lets discuss , brian

2	Subject: asset marketing / corporate development jeff , as we discussed , attached is a comprehensive list of the team and deals . as you know , louise formally calls our team asset marketing . i tend to think that we play a number of roles including corporate development , ctg , deal structuring , and anything else that is required to get a deal done . in addition to the core team , i believe we also need to consider other issues related to asset sales including dealbench ( " db " ) . db is a tremendous platform , that should be maintained . it facilitates the sales process in so many ways , and would require very little to keep it alive . jon hoff in our group can do almost anything related to db and would probably require one engineer ( not 100 % of his time ) to be available for db to maintained . in addition to our team , the development group run by ben jacoby has been selling development sites , and chris calger has a team out west that has had a lot of success . these groups ( or a subset thereof ) , i believe should be maintained for the assets that they hold today and potentially other sales as well . lastly , the asset sales that we are pursuing or have completed reflect a true team effort . there has been and remains a core group of people that embrace every asset sale that we do . people like mike j . miller , mitch robinson , and ross newlin contribute in many ways , and are great people to have around in discussing various issues including technical and operating issues . mitch and ross have been to almost every plant in the enron portfolio . while it is true that we have technical people in brazil or wherever , the question is whether they are capable and competent , and can they sell in front of a counterparty ? additionally , most of the plants that we built were designed and managed from houston . in addition to these guys , as you well know , asset sales take people from tax , insurance , environmental permitting , etc . we need to make sure these type of people are around , otherwise we end up with no incumbent knowledge base ( i am sure you recognize all of this ) . sorry for the long email and i hope this helps . don

" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , " chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview . earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years . future options for the broadband business include " sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities " he said . " we still think over time that it will be a valuable business , " lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a " total meltdown " , he added . enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters . enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations . enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 6 - enron posts loss after taking $ 1 bln in charges . by c . bryson hull 10 / 16 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , oct 16 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses . enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company . " what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , " chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call . lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm . houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 . the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago . " they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield , " said meade . enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period . ill - fated businesses originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity . the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled . enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets . enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential . enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 . debt on credit review rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent . the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 . all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year . the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility . the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations . in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) 2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york ) enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) ( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . ) houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion . the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million , or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion . investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news is out . ` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' ' said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' ' investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas - pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t confident enron was detailing all its problems . failed businesses the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the past four quarters . included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and international business machines corp . new power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies . the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be more specific . enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers . the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron said . enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than $ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill , lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' ' lay said . excluding losses minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier . shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 . ` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 . ` ridiculous investments ' at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses . enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water , from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million . in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier . revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million . ` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments . ' ' while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money . the company gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including coal , forest products and steel . ` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' ' hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and clear , and that the effort is there .

order on el paso capacity allocation chairman hoecker announced that ferc will hold a special meeting nov . 1 to issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the california wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway . only one item was discussed - an order resolving the amoco complaint over el paso ' s capacity allocation . in the order , the commission finds that el paso ' s allocation of delivery point capacity at topock is unjust & unreasonable . the commission directs el paso to assign primary point rights to its shippers using a one - time assignment process outlined in the order . if elections for primary point capacity exceed available space , el paso will pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their firm capacity rights . chairman hoecker said this case illustrates the fact that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the overbooking of airline capacity .

2	Subject: re : lng may 19 decision john , this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions . 1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project ( please , see point 2 ) . 2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction . the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 . a few comments on the book design and my view of the project : a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions . the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long - term contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words , we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction . b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension option of 5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for such a long tenor . this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread . one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the first 5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side . c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market . d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions . long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent . vince john sherriff 05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect subject : lng may 19 decision vince i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well . anyway with greg moving to his new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the eastern hemishere plus lng . i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for lng and lng ship values . i also understand that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far away ) . anway i understand this is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you please let me know where you stand now ? i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well . look forward to connecting with you vince . john

2	Subject: insightful media article on california power prices mark golden is an excellent reporter covering the power scene . our takeaways : * power prices are declining in california as the " destruction of demand " effect of higher retail power prices kicks in . * the long - term power contracts signed by the various power producers and energy merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them , as evidence of price weakness ( from a base of extremely high prices ) is beginning to develop . * the movement in prices in california is reflective of the message in our power curve 4 report , where we show that forward prices are peaking this summer . year / year power price comparisons are now projected to be flat 4 q : 01 , and declining afterwards . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * power points : great news ! long - term contracts jeopardized by mark golden a dow jones newswires column new york ( dow jones ) - - those looking for even the slightest bit of good news for the state of california can find it in friday ' s san jose mercury news . " california is in danger of losing more than 40 % of the power it has lined up in long - term contracts , " says the lead of a major article , because republicans in the state legislature didn ' t back the $ 12 . 5 billion bond deal last week . getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen to california in a long time . since the state went on its long - term buying binge , forward prices for power in the western u . s . have been falling steadily . gov . gray davis announced $ 43 billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on march 5 . contracts for summer power at palo verde , ariz . , a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of power into california , have fallen to $ 390 a megawatt - hour from a high of $ 600 / mwh in late march . further out , power for 2004 - 2006 at mid - columbia river , a key trading hub north of california , has fallen from $ 58 / mwh in february to $ 49 / mwh today . companies like calpine corp . ( cpn ) and dynegy ( dyn ) that took advantage of the state ' s buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy . in fact , they have affectionately started calling the governor gravy days . enron corp . ( ene ) , which has been selling aggressively for two months , according to traders , is looking like a genius as usual . generators that held out , like reliant energy ( rei ) and duke energy ( duk ) , may be sorry that they did . it ' s been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious pain in the markets , but that time has come . power generators may not make as much profit this summer as last , and power traders that have taken long speculative positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought them . as was seen in the eastern u . s . power markets last summer , long positions can turn out just as painful as short positions . for california , the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this summer won ' t be as bad as once expected . the bad news is that the state government is by far the biggest " long " in the bearish forward market . it ' s safe to say that the $ 43 billion in contracts signed in march have declined in value by 15 % , or $ 6 . 5 billion . that ' s almost as big of a financial disaster going forward as everything that has gone on since last summer until now . granted , this is a sort of damned - if - you - do - damned - if - you - don ' t situation . barring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years of deregulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in u . s . history . california should do some forward purchasing now , and it ' s such a behemoth that it will move the market up when it does so . and , when it gets done buying , prices will come down simply because it stopped . but that ' s a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the energy crisis . early this year , when the state started down the path of mega - purchasing , there was no shortage of advice not to do so . long - term prices were embedded with too much of today ' s supply - demand imbalance . the state would have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first - since it would have to do that anyway - and gradually securing forward power as declining prices reflected the improving situation . since then , the state has done a great job of crushing demand . electric usage is already down 9 % from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation efforts and a slowing economy , and people haven ' t even seen their 30 % higher bills yet . similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other western states and in natural gas usage nationally . this is likely what has been behind much of the downturn in forward power prices in the west . this column started with a false " good news " lead . it would be great for the state if , after the state ' s credit rating sinks further , sellers exercised their option to tear up the five - and ten - year contracts . but they won ' t do that . the prices are too good from the sellers ' perspective . calpine , which has signed three such contracts for the state , said immediately that it has no intention of reneging on its agreements . and gary ackerman , director of the sellers ' association , told the mercury news that he didn ' t expect power companies in general to back out of the deals . but there may be some real good news for california . the davis administration hired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading to purchase billions of dollars of power . perhaps they are quick learners . this week presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it needs - summer power for this year only - on sale . low prices in the daily market monday and tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to $ 325 / mwh , which is cheap by recent standards . the contract price moved up to $ 390 / mwh , but the state took advantage of the opportunity while the window was open . " the week ' s condition in the market place helped . we were able to procure some energy for june through september , " said state spokesman oscar hidalgo . and , hey , there were no blackouts this week . - by mark golden , dow jones newswires ; 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com ( end ) dow jones newswires 18 - 05 - 01 1952 gmt ( ap - dj - 05 - 18 - 01 1952 gmt ) raymond c . niles power / natural gas research salomon smith barney ( 212 ) 816 - 2807 ray . niles @ ssmb . com s

2	Subject: kmi ( ngpl ) order 637 changes protested note : see gas quality section at the bottom that they propose adding on their other pipelines , like they have on ngpl . shippers protest kmi ' s order 637 tariff changes kinder morgan interstate gas transmission ( kmi ) has attempted an end run around ferc ' s order 637 , filing wide - ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff procedures to avoid the more rigorous review in store for compliance filings , according to customer protests . items in kmi ' s tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories , indicated shippers said . they include imbalance provisions , storage balances , small customer service , gas quality , point allocations , curtailment priorities , right of first refusal , scheduling priorities , incidental purchase and sale , capacity release , unauthorized gas , capacity rights overrun charge , and miscellaneous . indicated shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of kmi ' s june 5 tariff filing ( rpo 0 - 316 ) , saying " most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by kmi to implement elements of order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity for meaningful review and comment by kmi ' s customers . " only 12 days are allowed for intervention and comment on usually routine tariff filings , while the federal energy regulatory commission has allotted 30 days for comments on order 637 compliance filings . kmi was among the group of pipelines slated to make compliance filings june 15 . kmi said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing , but was aimed at changing its tariff to reflect " the current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices . . " it did acknowledge , " a number of the changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the commission ' s goals in order no . 637 . " indicated shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding negative storage imbalances and end of season inventory swaps a matter of kmi ' s discretion without any standards on how those decisions would be made . the shippers also protested changes to the default methodology for point allocations for billing purposes , and the injection of kmi discretion into the formula for accepting or rejecting predetermined allocation agreements with upstream or downstream parties . in addition curtailment provisions filed by kmi appear to be contrary to order 637 - a ' s mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary path should have primary rights . the filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up significant quantities of coal bed methane gas in wyoming ' s powder river basin by imposing more rigorous standards on nitrogen content , according to western gas resources . a key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality specification of 3 % by volume . while kmi states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with interconnecting pipelines , six of the seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications . only kmi ' s affiliate , natural gas pipeline co . of america , has similar rules , western gas said . " kmi ' s proposed nitrogen specification would enable kmi to refuse to accept coal bed methane production for transportation , thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal means of downstream pipeline egress out of powder river production areas , " western gas added . producers would have to shut in production while they construct costly nitrogen facilities . this could " create at least a temporary gap in the downstream movement of coal bed supplies to mid - continent and eastern markets , thus frustrating consumer access to these significant supplies .

2	Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s " seriously flawed " market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west . the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000 price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power markets , is available at the following website : in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either " over - reached " or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is expected to be issued by year ' s end . at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient reserve requirements . highlights of proposed california structural remedy in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including : ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks . ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market . ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso and px . ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a temporary $ 150 / mwh " soft cap " that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150 from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 . ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if ferc finds non - competitive behavior . ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs . separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price capping authority . commissioner responses comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the " buy and sell " mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the commission prescribe specific remedies . hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the " soft cap " concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods , preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity . comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct " command and control . " she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements . comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach . he feels that the congress has " put its thumb on the scale " in the federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market price volatility . finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted that this is " no time to pull punches . " he emphasized that the commission needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the state level are slowing the " meandering transition " to competition . he feels that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation . if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at 202 / 508 - 5499 .

2	Subject: re : efa meetings hey vince , thanks for your reply . i ' ll see what becomes of the session and keep you informed . as to the paper , tim crack and i have a revised version of the paper i gave you . we have since found out that by using certainty equivalence , our model is more robust . for example , if one has an asset pricing model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( harvey and siddique , jf june , 2000 ) and a binomial model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( johnson , paulukiewicz , and mehta , rqfa , 1997 ) , our model allows you to price options under the real world measure . the benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical data that is non - risk neutralized . from a pricing perspective , there isn ' t a tremendous benefit in a mean - variance world ( variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky measure ) . however , in the mean - variance - skewness world , there is a benefit because we do not believe ( although we ' re still hunting down an appropriate cite ) skewness is the same under risk - neutral and risky measure . given we can only measure the skewness in our risky world , our model becomes much more significant . i would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like to see it . thanks again , tom

2	Subject: bridgeline louise : please find the attached presentation that jean , don and i came by to discuss with you . i know you are up to your eyes in credit issues , so we can talk about this when you get a chance . we wanted to review the impact of the merger on bridgeline . specifically , the potential benefits for putting in place an asset management structure for bhlp . dynegy has expressed interest in commercially managing these assets and enron would to , if we would not have to pay an excessive fee to do so . jean ' s initial analysis indicates that bridgeline is currently undervaluing the accrual value of the pipe and over - valuing trading . we may be able to use this fact to our advantage in establishing a " low " asset management fee to pay to bridgeline . in addition , we may be able to reduce our deployed capital by selling the accrual value in bhlp to an mlp who is willing to pay a premium for stable cash / earnings . the mlp could be one of enron ' s ( e . g . northern boarder , eott ) , or a chev / tex mlp ( ? ) , or even a 3 rd party mlp . the deciding factor should be the value the mlp is willing to pay for the earnings stream . we have continued to discuss this with the chev / tex board members who remain interested in evaluating the benefits of this structure . in their view , the dynegy / enron merger is a positive fact because it removes the dynegy vs . enron competition . when you get a chance we can talk . brian

2	Subject: re : option p & l brad , i was extreamly busy yesterday . sorry for answing your question till now . although i am not exactly sure how the system handle gamma , this is what i think the system is doing : curve shift  today ' s price - yesterady ' s price p / l due to curve shift  today ' s market value using today ' s price curve ( with everything esle the same as yesterday ' s ) - yesterday ' s market value using yesterday ' s price curve . so p / l due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order terms . we then use theoretical gamma ( meaning option model gamma : 0 . 5 * gamma * ( price change ) 2 ) for gamma contribution and ? define delta  curve shift - theoretical gamma . ? ? therefore , the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the delta change , ? especially when you have big price change due to higher order contribution . ? ? let me know your thoughts on this . ? ? ? best wishes , ? ? zimin ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? brad horn 10 / 12 / 2000 07 : 11 am ? ? to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect ? cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vladimir gorny / hou / ect @ ect , robert ? shiring / hou / ect @ ect , jay knoblauh / hou / ect @ ect ? subject : option p & l ? ? gentleman : ? the erms system , as you know , has an excellent capability for ? decomposing option p & l into the following components : ? ? new deals ? curve shift ? gamma ? vega ? theta ? rho ? drift ? 2 nd order adjustments ? ? what i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars . ? the unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position ? is being associated with specific prices . these prices are the effective buy ? or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position . ? ? stated differently , the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price ? variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma ' s ? standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs . this is something i dont ? understand . to date , inquiries to the risk management accounting group has ? further revealed that the gamma component of p & l is not well understood . ? ? this is what concerns me : bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures ( nymex ? and gas daily ) . both books dynamically hedged its positions during ? yesterdays large price move and , through anticipitory hedging in advance or ? during the large price move , secured sufficient coverage to neutralize ? expected changes in delta . however , our p & l from our underlying position did ? not offset our gamma p & l . consequently , i have to ask why ? im hoping that a ? brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which ? will better guide our hedging decisions . ? ? any help is appreciated ? ?

2	Subject: california update 9 - 07 - 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summary ? mou passes assembly , faces fight in senate ? cpuc direct access delayed by senator socal developments as reported in the press this morning , the bailout passed the assembly late last night by a 41 - 32 vote . it will now head to the senate , where very significant opposition is expected . along with his opposition to the changes made in the assembly regarding the size of businesses that pay the dedicated rate component for the bailout , senator burton also has expressed privately that he is against paying twice book value for socal ' s transmission assets . senator places hold on cpuc direct access vote regarding the cpuc ' s decision to delay its hearings on the rate order and various other bond implementation measures ( which led treasurer angelides to announce that the bond issue will have to be re - timed ) , this delay is due to a bill by senator burton that passed the assembly appropriations committee yesterday . burton ' s bill would take the place of the current proposed rate agreement ( from governor davis ) and would require greater disclosure and transparency in dwr ratemaking , as well as separate the payment streams for the bonds from payment streams for power . in doing so , burton ' s bill preserves more puc authority than would be preserved under the rate order currently before the puc - thus the delay in action . pg & e also supports burton ' s bill , which is very likely to pass the assembly and which the governor will likely have to sign . if this bill is signed , pg burton wants to ensure that businesses will have to return to purchasing power from dwr at that time . the ctma is opposed to burton ' s bill and to the bailout if no direct access is offered . the ctma wants its members to be able to escape from buying power from the dwr ( and therefore paying off the bonds ) permanently in 2003 .

2	Subject: update - reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle . although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices . to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports . by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the turnaround time for payment of invoices . incidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has used for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement . we  , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or suggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .

2	Subject: review of disposed assets for residual value and / or potential exposure louise : attached is an excel file which lists the results of our search for residual assets or old assets with potential exposure . most of the assets on this list are currently being monitored by special assets or energy capital resources . we included these assets on the list because they have not been very visible and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of their existence . however , also included on the list are 3 to 4 transactions similar to midwest gas storage in that it appears that they have not been on anyone ' s radar screen . the scope of our review did not include any former enron international assets now managed by wholesale through the global assets group . our list is divided into 3 parts : 1 ) retained assets , 2 ) bankruptcy / guarantor claims , 3 ) transactions requiring legal documentation / closure . the bankruptcy / guarantor list is not an all inclusive list of bankruptcies for wholesale but includes those merchant portfolio bankruptcies with a low probability of recovery which are , of course , not a high priority for legal . we just want to make sure they don ' t completely disappear from our scrutiny . you will also note that there are a couple of assets that require further review and we will advise you when we make a final determination . finally , we will take steps to include these assets in future portfolio reporting so that they can be closely monitored . many thanks to dick lydecker ' s group and legal for their assistance to rac in reviewing numerous disposed assets that resulted in this list . please call if you have questions . regards ! rick c . 
2	Subject: 8 / 22 cec meeting - - natural gas infrastructure report at the cec meeting today , the commission did not adopt the draft final report on natural gas infrastructure issues in order to give staff additional time to review further comments received from socal , edison and others . in the draft report distributed earlier this month you may recall that the report clearly indicates that the state utilties need to build additional intrastate capacity to provide take away capacity from the border and more closely match current and projected interstate pipeline capacity . lad lorenz on behalf of socal spoke at the meeting reiterating their viewpoint that they currently have sufficient backbone transmission facilities however he offered that the issue of getting customers to commit to long - term contracts should be added to the report as a basis for increasing capacity . a spokeman for edison stated that while the report mentions the possibility that market manipulation may have contributed towards the high gas prices during the last heating season , they would like to see the report reflect that market manipulation in fact did in part , cause higher prices and he went on to cite the el paso ferc proceeding as substantiation for this position . given these comments , the adoption of the report was delayed until staff has had a chance to conduct further analysis . most likely it will be on the agenda in sept .

2	Subject: re : stressing correlations hi , everybody , following up on our discussions on stressing correlations i made a spreadsheet and a dll . here is what it does : in the input ( " main " sheet ) the user has to specify : - the size of the correlation matrix ; - the row and column for the element he wants to stress ( row  1 and col  3 in the example ) - the integer number n _ iter ; - the original correlation matrix . in the output ( see sheet " results " ) we see 2 columns : - the first column contains possible correlation values ( from - 1 to 1 , n _ iter + 1 numbers ) for the element ( 1 , 3 ) , - the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the " stressed " correlation matrix ( which is the same as the original matrix except the elements ( 1 , 3 ) and ( 3 , 1 ) which take values from - 1 to 1 ) . thus , the user can see which values for the chosen element ( 1 , 3 ) are permitted ( those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive ( marked green in the example ) . the user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is " not permitted " to this particular element ( the smallest eigenvalue is negative ) . then the user might have a few options : 1 . all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the chosen element has the desired correlation in it , but the change in the correlation matrix is the " smallest " possible ( in the sense of matrix norm ) ( this is my next step to do for this spreadsheet ) . 2 . just one column ( and the corresponding row , of course ) will change , while the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged ( kevin ' s suggestion ) . in this case the user have to choose which column ( and row ) he prefers to modify ( in my example - column - row 1 or column - row 3 ) . we can discuss this approach with risk control and see how they like it . i send you only the spreadsheet with an example now . tanya .

2	Subject: speeding up your hiring process hiring managers , here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a offer to your candidates . all applicants must fill out and sign an application and a fair credit reporting act form ( included with the application ) prior to being interviewed . you may either have the applicant fill out a form before you interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36 th floor to fill out the forms before you interview them . notify hector mcloughlin or frank dejesus if you are interviewing an external candidate that is a former enron employee . all previous enron employees will be reviewed by hr and sally beck prior to being invited to interview . we hope that this process will eliminate re - hiring poor performers . if you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a management position , please include sally beck in the process for input . as a final step of the selection process , sally would like to meet with the candidate if time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative . sally ' s involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a potential management new hire . thanks for your help with this process . ena energy ops human resources team 
2	Subject: new albany generator # 3 repair work we have tentatively reached an arrangement with duke regarding the repair work . if closing takes place prior to completion of the repair work , duke will assume control of the repairs and enron will continue to pay actual invoices received in connection with the repair work so long as they are consistent with the agreed upon scope of work . currently the estimated costs are $ 1 . 45 million ( these have increased slightly from our prior conversations because of new problems uncovered when the generator was opened up ) . we are reasonably certain that no further material problems should arise in the completion of the work and that the estimated cost is reasonable static . on the insurance claim related to this work , i understand that the insurance company is balking at paying two components of the repair work which will likely ( if this is their final , unchallenged position ) result in the deductible exceeding the loss payable ( i . e . no insurance proceeds payable to ena ) . please feel free to call with any questions . stuart

' s ratings on rating watch negative by fitch . the rating of the marlin ii notes is supported by an overfund account ( pre - funded interest ) and equity commitment from enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock . the overfund account is invested in enron debt securities ( rated ' bbb + ' , rating watch negative ) , with payments used to service interest to noteholders . payment of principal ultimately relies on enron ' s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities . fitch currently rates enron ' s preferred securities ' bbb - ' , rating watch negative . in addition , the transaction also benefits from rights under a $ 125 million loan to azurix europe limited , rated ` bbb + ' by fitch . similarly , the rating of the osprey i notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments . the mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust . the assets in the share trust supporting interest payments include enron unsecured obligations ( the overfund account ) as well as quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible preferred stock . while various sources of repayment exist , such as sale or liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering , in each case primary credit support is derived from the enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee the 120 - day prior to the maturity date , which is one of the note trigger events . in the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes , enron is required to deliver additional shares . if enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation , subject to certain standstill periods , then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of enron , representing a general unsecured claim . additional note trigger events include a downgrade of enron ' s senior unsecured debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in enron ' s closing stock price over three consecutive trading days , as well as customary events of default under the notes . it is important to note that enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt . fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction with the ratings of enron , corp . and will update investors as appropriate . enron ' s debt falls as company draws down on bank loans 10 / 26 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early friday following the houston energy giant ' s decision thursday to draw down about $ 3 billion on its bank loan facilities . late thursday , enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community . specifically , the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $ 1 billion . enron ' s 6 . 4 % bonds which come due in july 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar , down from around 82 cents on thursday . trading activity in investment - grade bank debt like that of enron ' s isn ' t as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment - grade ratings . but fixed - income sources noted some offers friday for enron ' s bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar , still well - above distressed levels . they add that banks may want to try to sell enron ' s bank debt , which is now funded following the drawdown , but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago . that was well before enron ran into its current market turmoil . last week , the company reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the company has said that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with andrew s . fastow , its former chief financial officer who was replaced on wednesday . moody ' s investors service rates enron ' s senior unsecured debt at baal , though it ' s on review for a possible downgrade . fitch inc . and standard & poor ' s both rate the debt triple - b - plus . fitch also has enron ' s debt on review for a possible downgrade , while s joe . niedzielski @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron sues microsoft over failed broadband services deal by michael rieke of dow jones newswires 10 / 26 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 713 - 547 - 9207 ; michael . rieke @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business enron unit takes heat power group says energy firm failed bond requirements jeffrey krasner , globe staff 10 / 26 / 2001 the boston globe third c . 1 ( copyright 2001 ) the retail sales subsidiary of houston energy giant enron corp . faced expulsion last week from the new england group representing power generators , marketers and distributors . the sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills . iso new england , which operates the power grid throughout the six new england states , urged nepool , the power industry group , to " initiate termination proceedings " for enron energy services inc . , according to a letter obtained by the globe . an enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied nepool ' s requirements , and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights , including the failure of iso new england to warn enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels . " it was an administrative snafu , " said peggy mahoney , a spokeswoman for enron . " it ' s fixed . it ' s no big deal . we didn ' t get the paperwork in [ on time ] because it got sent to the wrong desk . it was taken care of on friday . " according to the letter , a nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months . " having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently , " said ellen foley , an iso new england spokeswoman . in the letter , iso ' s chief financial officer , edward mckenna , said his organization " has been in contact with enron energy services through multiple telephone communications , and to date the financial assurance has not been cured . " but mahoney said enron never received written notification of its previous " financial assurance " defaults , which were corrected almost immediately . therefore , she said , the company was unaware that the current default was the third , which begins the expulsion proceeding . in addition , she said , the current default notice was sent to the wrong person , creating the delay that resulted in the letter . " we ' re working with iso new england to figure that out , " she said . the recommended termination is an embarrassment to enron because the firm ' s director of state government affairs , daniel w . allegretti , is the chairman of nepool ' s participant committee , which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization . " this is not that unusual within the pool , " said allegretti . " i frequently receive notices of technical defaults . " as far as posting the new bond to correct the situation , he said , " we were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork . " the incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for enron . the parent in houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm ' s chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . the securities and exchange commission is probing those transactions , the company said monday . enron placed fastow on leave tuesday and installed a new cfo . enron ' s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company ' s financial strength . the company reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by fastow , according to the wall street journal . enron lost $ 618 million in the third quarter . yesterday , enron ' s shares closed at $ 16 . 35 , down 6 cents , on volume of 39 . 1 million shares . jeffrey krasner can be reached by e - mail at krasner @ globe . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . front page - companies oct 26 , 2001 by julie earle and sheila mcnulty enron has put up a page on its website of " frequently asked questions " in response to a barrage of analysts ' enquiries following last week ' s controversial results announcement . unfortunately , the us energy group ' s critics have not been satisfied with the answers . nor has wednesday ' s decision to replace andrew fastow , its chief financial officer , quelled all investors ' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs . however , analysts are pleased that kenneth lay , chief executive officer , is distancing the group from mr fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle " partnerships " . " it is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move , " says ronald barone of ubs warburg . " it ' s not the end of it . " the shares , which have tumbled since last week ' s results , ended a shade lower yesterday , off 0 . 37 per cent at dollars 16 . 35 . but analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52 - week high of dollars 84 . 87 until the group improves its transparency . one of the frequently asked questions following enron ' s results announcement on october 16 concerned " a dollars 1 . 2 bn ( pounds 840 m ) reduction in shareholders ' equity " . the dollars 1 . 2 bn was not explained in the news release on the results , but mentioned in passing by mr lay in a follow - up conference call . many analysts confused it with a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge in the earnings report . it has since been called a " loss " and a " write - off " and enron ' s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language . enron ' s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders ' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which ljm , a private equity fund formed by mr fastow , was an investor . when the decision was made to terminate these vehicles , enron " recorded a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables . these adjustments were the result of enron ' s termination of obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods " . the confusion over the dollars 1 . 2 bn has further undermined the credibility of enron , which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group ' s debt ratio , which might hurt its debt rating . mr lay held an analysts ' meeting to counter charges that enron was not transparent . but this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts . " i find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions , " said goldman sachs ' david fleischer . other analysts are also concerned about potential further write - offs . salomon smith barney ' s raymond niles points to enron ' s investments in its dabhol indian power plant , its south american investments , and its remaining telecoms assets . most importantly , he says , they may include several of enron ' s other off - balance - sheet vehicles . " frankly , we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them , " mr niles says . other us energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival . el paso said it was facing " a lot of questions on its accounting practices " . additional reporting by julie earle enron in turmoil : www . ft . com / enron copyright : the financial times limited enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 14 : 26 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) ( adds egan - jones lowering credit rating in 12 th paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond rating wouldn ' t be lowered and tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets . enron ' s stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after investors questioned the company ' s transactions with affiliated companies run by its former chief financial officer . the stock fell 45 cents to $ 15 . 90 in early afternoon trading today . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion of fixed income assets at fifth third bancorp . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself .

2	Subject: non - firm power curve building hi vince , amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position . my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk . assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define " non - firm " ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the " non - firm curve for the region " ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units . maybe i could get your thoughts later today . thanks , vasant

mail category : alert product line : western energy , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u  5526 the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the rockies . generation within the region remains nearly all coal - fired . these regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through september . moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the henry hub . however , summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels . higher gas prices are likely to resurface . regional power market drivers august demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 percent , or nearly 5 , 500 amw , over average june levels ( see table 1 ) . peak demand levels should exceed those in june as well , with a coincident peak over the whole western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) of 118 , 600 mw expected under normal weather conditions in 2000 , a 2 . 7 percent increase over the weather - muted 1999 peak . california alone should experience peak loads that are approximately 3 , 600 mw higher than peak levels in june . available generation capacity in the west has been at normal levels for this time of year , although coal - fired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but short - lived outages . the steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove 3 , 900 amw from the west resource base when compared with july levels and about 6 , 800 amw since june , although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of june . given hydro operators ' economic interest in maximizing on - peak production at the expense of off - peak production , the loss of capacity during the on - peak period will be lower than these levels . august will be a critical month for the heavily import - dependent state of california . while the state will be drawing approximately 7 , 000 amw of imports during august to meet demands during peak periods , cera expects the level of imports to exceed 8 , 200 mw during peak demand conditions . the southwest ' s need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to california , and lower year - over - year hydroelectric production in the pacific northwest will limit exports from that region . pacific northwest cera expects pacific northwest demand in august to climb by nearly 1 , 300 amw when compared with june levels . the water supply for the pacific northwest has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the lower columbia owing to warmer - than - normal weather in june . in addition , normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about 6 , 000 amw from the resource base when compared with levels in june ( see table 2 ) . generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gas - fired generation at high levels . although less than 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired generation is currently available in the region , it has been running at high utilization rates . high energy demand in california for pacific northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions . as in june , pacific northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility cera expects to occur in california in august . in addition , if hot weather in the pacific northwest pressures regional energy reserves , local prices will rise to keep energy in the region , potentially causing prices in the pacific northwest to move higher than those to the south . california california is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance . although hydroelectric output continues to decline , statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 percent of normal . nevertheless , declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about 730 amw when compared with hydroelectric production levels in june . normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3 , 600 amw over june levels , which were high ( see table 3 ) . california ' s peak load is expected to exceed 57 , 000 mw , compared with a peak load in june of approximately 53 , 500 mw ( 43 , 447 mw on the state ' s iso system alone , according to its own estimate ) . assuming normal plant outage rates , this demand level will necessitate the import of about 8 , 200 mw of energy to meet the statewide peak . even after curtailing the approximately 2 , 800 mw of interruptible load available for tight supply situations , the state has a precarious 6 percent capacity margin during the system peak . an extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional 3 , 000 mw . outages are likely if additional imports are not available . a capacity limit of 4 , 600 mw will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the pacific northwest to northern california . the import limit from the pacific northwest to southern california will be 3 , 100 mw . rockies and southwest august demand levels in the combined rockies / southwest region will increase only slightly above levels in august 1999 , climbing approximately 275 amw , as loads in the region - unlike the rest of the below - average wscc - were near normal last august . even so , august loads will increase demand by over 1 , 250 amw when compared with levels in june of this year . as with last year and this june , supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather , although growing loads in the rockies / southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions . high loads driven by hot weather will keep the region ' s prices high . differentials between the region and california will be tight , but california , having tighter supply - demand balances , will need to price at a premium to attract energy . the high - capacity transmission ties between the rockies / southwest and the california market , which is about 150 percent the size of the rockies / southwest market , will ensure that prices in the rockies / southwest stay close behind california prices whenever loads are high in california . regional gas market drivers evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the west , and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures . since the northern border expansion in late 1998 , narrow north - south and east - west differentials across pricing points defined the market . this summer , the continuing supply growth in the rocky mountains has widened differentials between the rockies and the rest of the west . at topock , increasing gas demand in california and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums . overall in north american gas markets , strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices - from an early july henry hub price of $ 4 . 50 per mmbtu to under $ 4 . 00 per mmbtu . however , despite these high injection rates , the supply - demand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious . summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices . the ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average henry hub price of $ 4 . 20 per mmbtu in august . through the end of the summer , differentials in the west should hold near current levels . the pressure of growing rocky mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall . in california high seasonal power loads should continue through august with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation . demand strength is expected to continue . across the west , august demand for gas should climb from 9 . 8 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day in june to 10 . 4 bcf per day , buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation ( see table 4 ) . california high gas demand for power generation within california will continue through august . cera expects an increase from the state ' s june demand levels of 5 . 6 bcf per day to 6 . 2 bcf per day during august . the increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads . total demand is expected to exceed last year ' s demand level by 1 . 2 bcf per day . this will increase flows on pipelines into california , reduce the state ' s storage surplus , and sustain high prices . cera expects pipeline utilization rates during august to average 95 percent ( see table 5 ) . cera expects an august topock - henry hub differential of $ 0 . 45 per mmbtu ( see table 6 ) . pacific northwest despite the extremely high prices at topock and high demand in california , until recently gas at malin priced at a slight discount to henry hub prices . after averaging $ 0 . 17 per mmbtu below the henry hub during the third quarter last year , the differential so far during the third quarter this year is $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu below the hub . this week malin is pricing at a $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu premium relative to the henry hub . the topock - malin differential has swelled to over $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu , signaling intra - california pipeline capacity constraints . two factors pressured malin differentials during the early summer . * pressure on rocky mountain and aeco differentials . prices in the two areas supplying the pacific northwest are under some pressure . increasing supplies in the rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on rockies prices by limiting external market access . at aeco , although export capacity out of the province is available , almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern canada on transcanada pipeline . pipelines into the united states are running near capacity . because of transcanada ' s limited ability to discount interruptible transport , the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled . * low early summer regional demand . gas demand in the pacific northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output . even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year , seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in may and june even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in california . increasing power loads are already evident . the first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the rockies and western canada begins climbing . however , gas demand for power generation in the pacific northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of july and into august as hydroelectric generation wanes . this added demand - 200 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day above june demand levels - will provide some support for malin prices and limited support for rockies and aeco prices . malin - henry hub differentials are expected to average $ 0 . 05 per mmbtu above the henry hub price during august . rocky mountains pressure on regional supplies within the rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs . differentials to the henry hub have widened to over $ 0 . 70 per mmbtu and although prices in the rest of the west will gain some support from high power loads , regional demand in the rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through august . august demand is expected to average 1 . 2 bcf per day in the region , approximately equal to june ' s 1 . 1 bcf per day total demand . demand begins to build during september , but until the heating season begins in october , rocky mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the west . cera expects a rocky mountain - henry hub differential of $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu during august . although some narrowing in rocky mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall , the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001 . cera expects a supply build this year of nearly 300 mmcf per day , followed by a build of over 350 mmcf per day during 2001 . currently , approximately 300 mmcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region , with the largest increment on transcolorado into the san juan basin . next summer , all capacity will likely run close to full . until export pipelines expand - the first likely expansion is trailblazer - differentials will remain wide . for 2001 , cera expects an average annual differential below the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu . southwest differentials in the san juan and permian basins have gained considerable strength relative to henry hub prices amid the recent hot weather in texas . permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the henry hub price , and in the san juan basin prices have narrowed from an early july differential of $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu to a differential of less than $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . cera expects demand in the southwest during august of 1 . 4 bcf per day , an increase from june ' s level of 1 . 3 bcf per day , but the larger texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins . cera expects a san juan differential of $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu during august , with a permian basin differential of $ 0 . 06 per mmbtu . differentials between the rocky mountains and the san juan basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the rocky mountains . flows on transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 20 mmcf per day to over 100 mmcf per day during june . supply in the two regions is following opposite paths ; rockies supply is climbing rapidly , and san juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year . cera expects a decline in supply of 30 mmcf per day during 2000 relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 mmcf per day during 2001 . because of these different outlooks , wider rockies - san juan differentials will persist . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this monthly briefing with associated tables . note : should the above url not work , please use the following : account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e -

2	Subject: re our meeting yesteday and discussion concerning energy capital resources . you are entirely correct that , from a management control standpoint , any investment whose performance falls well short of its approved projected financial profile should be considered for transfer into a " special " or " management scrutiny " portfolio . the only issue , then , is whether the charter of energy capital is an exception to that general control principle . secondly , with respect to expedited dash processing . i met with dave gorte this morning to discuss some suggestions i had made , including going to an electronic approval system . apparently he and rick buy would be in favor but jeff skilling insists on a paper signature rather than electronic . what rac is going to do to begin , however , is a system of electronic dash circulation including a signature page which could be printed out , signed , and then collected for the paper trail that jeff requires . i think this could significantly improve the process although it still does not address the issue of approvers who are unwilling to delegate responsibility when they are unavailable or approvers who insist on seeing other signatures before they will sign . i also believe there could be other dash issues beyond process , but that is a much broader question .

2	Subject: please endeavour to use this for charity . from : mrs . ruth makary . please endeavour to use this for charity . calvary greetings ! ! my name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a nationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with kuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile crash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child . before his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive we protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life insurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance company . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the purpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of accrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund and the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but unfortunately he dies . recently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this sickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the breaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved in an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december 1999 . having known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate this fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches , orphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to ensure that the house of god is maintained . i took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are not christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision . i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is entitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so . with god all things are possible . i have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive your reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the contacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the freezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process the liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you to take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a reality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i pray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project . i want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other people for this same purpose . please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in anyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always remember me in your prayers . expecting to hearing from you . remain blessed in the name of the lord . yours in christ , mrs . ruth makary .

2	Subject: direct access 8 / 10 / 01 below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access . we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated . summary : direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california ' s 1996 deregulation law . under this concept , all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility . the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california ' s costly power crisis . it will determine whether businesses , with residential customers , pay for the bulk of the state ' s future energy purchases . it also could determine whether southern california edison , the state ' s cash - strapped no . 2 utility , will avoid bankruptcy , and whether deregulation will survive in any form . big businesses , free - market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so - called " direct access " . now , as the state prepares to sell $ 13 . 4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt , legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct - access escape route . regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system , the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long - term electricity contracts through 2021 . that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $ 43 billion in future power costs , a point that has enraged consumer groups . currently , only about 88 , 000 customers buy their energy through direct access ( per cec statistics ) , including about 10 , 000 large commercial / industrial customers , and about 78 , 000 residences . alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california ' s primary utility suppliers ( socal ed . , pg & e , sdg & e ) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature . california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan , sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley . under the plan , the 3 , 600 largest businesses would agree to pay $ 3 . 1 billion of edison ' s debts over 15 years . in exchange , businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003 , but not without first paying an " exit fee . " the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california ' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms . to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd . complicating the issue is wall street . the state ' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy .

2	Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 ) fred or anita , i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121 is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done , she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter . for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957 and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use 449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal 449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal 449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences . in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on that yet . please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !

2	Subject: henwood & psim stinson / vince , the henwood runs for dabhol are , at least temporarily , over . however , the main modeller for henwood ( david yumigada ) works out of their california office . it maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs , and explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group . in aparticular , now that i am going through some of the comments people have raised on the psim model , i think there is value in understanding the way henwood deals with hot and cold starts , ramp up costs , and with issues of cycling plants . i think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the psim , and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models . this is a suggestion , and so please let me know if you see value in this . regards , sandeep .

2	Subject: high growth investing for tomorrow high growth investing company ceo interviewsemerging technologies new trends to watchindustry statistics view pdf are americans and the rest of the world becoming addicted to online gaming ? analysts predict over $ 14 billion dollars a year will go to online casinos gaming stocks may be set to explode ! read the full 10 page report includes inside : company profile : gaming transactions inc . this publicly traded company looks like it has what it takes to become a big player in the online gambling world . could it be the next payoff for investors ? . . . more the online gambling market given the rate at which this market is expanding across the planet , the outlook for the online gaming industry looks very positive . do the numbers add up for investors ? . . . more how big could it get ? online gaming has become a seriously big business , with shares in some companies increasing by up to eight times inside a year . . . . more pick of the month : ggts gaming transactions operates in one of the fastest growing industries around and has an experienced management team . early investors , who get in before the institutional investors , could make a fortune . . . . more ggts : ceo interview patrick smyth and stephen white head up company dedicated to bringing the next generation of online gaming . . . read full interview the asian market according to the diffusion group and game trust , china will become the # 1 online gaming market by 2007 . . . . more investors are making huge gains as the world bets online . could gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

2	Subject: bc hydro interview 5 / 21 / 01 sources have conducted the following " off - the - record " interview with a bc hydro executive . executive summary ? bc hydro projected capacity ? bc hydro / liberal government ' s export policy ? bc hydro expanded capacity projects bc hydro capacity the individual stated that bc hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply british colombia through 2005 , even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion . he stated that bc hydro ' s long - term contracts to supply power to the grid in the western us amounted to only 1 % of bc hydro ' s capacity . therefore , the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through powerex , the company ' s " main revenue generator . " for example , according to a company report , bc hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $ 2 . 876 billion canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001 , largely due to spot market trading . bc hydro exports bc hydro feels the new liberal government likely will " make a concerted effort to expand capacity " in british colombia . likewise , since the liberal government will be " business - oriented , " the bc hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the us . however , the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point , as " people don ' t necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export . " this is due to broad - based environmental opposition to building more plants . therefore , in the long - term bc hydro ' s new projects will favor " green alternatives " such as dam expansion and biomass , thermal and solar plants over gas - fired plants . the spokesman stated that the liberal party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove bc hydro ' s monopoly on power . if and when this happens , relations between the company and the government are expected to " quickly sour . " bc hydro capacity projects bc hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand / improve generation capacity , including : ? seven - mile dam - - bc hydro will likely add a 213 mw turbine to the 3 units already in place ? revelstoke dam - - bc hydro is " looking very seriously " at adding a 500 mw unit to the 4 units already in place . there is also the potential to add a 5 th 500 mw unit , though this is not being considered at this time . ? site c dam - - a plan for a 960 mw dam was shelved in the 1980 s due to environmental concerns , but now appears to once again be a " viable option . " though bc hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time , the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980 s , and that resurrecting the plan would be a bc hydro decision . ? burrard thermal plant - bc hydro has invested $ 250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions . calpine has bought a 240 mw gas - fired co - generation plant called campbell river on vancouver island . this plant is " in the final stages of testing and is already generating . " calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially " in the next few weeks . " bc hydro will buy power from the plant for use on vancouver island . this is part of a plan to make vancouver island self - sufficient in electricity . another " key plank " in this plan is the port alberni plant , a 250 mw , independently - owned plant that is being sold to bc hydro . the plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply vancouver island .

2	Subject: article on skilling ' s speech at the aa energy conference drive to succeed : enron prefers toyota to gm to prosper in the new energy economy , enron coo jeffrey k . skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of u . s . consumers 30 years ago . in a somewhat back - to - the - future treatise on how enron expects to continue its monumental success , skilling told arthur andersen energy conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry , but rather by their skills base . toyota changed the u . s . auto industry by outsourcing its production , offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster . the energy industry has to do the same thing into the future , he told the houston audience . " in 1982 , the energy industry was a very rigid industry , " he said , pointing to a similar business model that had been used by general motors and ford motor co . those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process , keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure . then toyota turned things upside down . when a customer wanted a different radio , toyota relied on outside producers . it didn ' t stop the production line to please the customer . and it was able to do it faster . enron has used the same model to shape its achievements , packaging components for customers to save time and money . other energy companies are now adopting that method . in many ways , skilling said enron views itself as the toyota of the energy industry . " we don ' t feel we have to provide all components , but package them the way the customer wants them . this is a pervasive trend we are seeing all over the industry . " enron , which has had a shareholder return of 1 , 333 % in 10 years ( january 1990 to november 2000 ) , saw the changes required by new technology and deregulation and redefined its core competencies , which grew from its pipeline business . skilling said to remain successful , the houston - based corporation plans to continue to morph . " it all hinges on one good idea enron had in the 1980 s , that vertically integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were starting to break up . in the energy industry , the reason was deregulation . fundamentally , this is a better business structure for two reasons : you can be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much more quickly . " instead of bigger energy companies , skilling said he expects to see many smaller companies , " maybe thousands tied together electronically and vertically . " the transformation and interaction costs are " collapsing across the economy . " as an example of interaction costs , skilling used bank tellers . in 1985 , it cost a bank $ 1 . 50 a transaction . to bank on the internet today , it costs a bank less than a penny . this drop in interaction costs is a major reason enron finds the bandwidth market so attractive . in 1995 , the length of time to provision bandwidth was six to eight months . today , it ' s two to three months . and next year , skilling predicts it will take one second . " we will have bandwidth on demand by next year , " he said , and added that enron plans to be the leader in the field . similarly , long - term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to execute . in 1989 , they took nine months . three years ago , they took two weeks to execute . today , using enrononline and other similar internet trading systems , it takes less than one second . " all of the sudden the world has changed . we have the same manufacture cost , but interactive costs collapse . i think that because of this , we ' ll see the collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world , " skilling said . to survive , skilling advised companies to " virtually reintegrate " what they need . " if you have an old vertically integrated mind set , it ' s tough . give it up . i know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves . i don ' t get it . it makes no sense whatsoever . you can get it online at the lowest cost . if your business strategy is dependent on this , it will be a very hard row to hoe . " each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 years , predicted the enron president . " you ' re not just competing against three people in west texas , but thousands around the world . " opportunities exist , he said , for those companies that " go with the flow and find ways to compete . create low cost , dependable market interfaces . . . provide packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures , differentiation and customization . " the only threat is from the old way of doing business , he said . " but there is tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you ' ve never been able to do . " he suggested a " new " energy model based on brainpower , networking , offering real options to customers , moving quickly and being entrepreneurial . " at enron , this has been the whole premise : to be able to change by responding and reacting to the environment . by getting components together and packaging them for the customer . "
